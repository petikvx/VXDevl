<P align=3Dcenter><BIG><BIG><STRONG><FONT size=3D+1>An Overview of The =
Seventh=20
International Virus Bulletin Conference (VB=9297)</FONT>.=20
</STRONG></BIG></BIG></P>
<P>The conference was held&nbsp; Oct.2-3, 1997 in SF. The partially =
accurate=20
program of the conference is available on <A=20
href=3D"http://www.virusbtn.com/VB97/programme_tables.html">http://www.vi=
rusbtn.com/VB97/programme_tables.html</A>.=20
</P>
<P>I would like to single out the following five presentations that IMHO =
deserve=20
attention:=20
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>1. David J. Stang: "In pursuit of prevalence: a look at 'In the =
Wild'". </P>
<P>2. Jimmy Kuo: "Free Macro Anti-virus Techniques". </P>
<P>3. David Aubrey-Jones: "Macro Attacks on Office =9197" </P>
<P>4. Dmitry Gryaznov: "Scanning the =91Net'" </P>
<P>5. Martin Overton: "FAT32 - New Problems for Anti-virus or=20
Viruses?</P></DIR></DIR>
<P align=3Dleft>The most impressive was the presentation by David J. =
Stang. Its=20
title could probably be changed to "'In The Wild List' Is Dead". =
Although David=20
diplomatically stated that "This article is NOT an attack on the =
developers of=20
any wild list" it was actually a RIP for the&nbsp; "In The Wild List" =
urban=20
legend. IMHO this is probably the main result of VB=9297. Better late =
than never=20
;-). I hope that after this presentation the new editor of the Virus =
Bulletin=20
will abandon the "In The Wild" urban legend.</P>
<H2 align=3Dcenter>Overview of the Best Presentations</H2>
<H3>David J. Stang: "In pursuit of prevalence: a look at "In The =
Wild"</H3>
<P>I had never&nbsp; listened to David before and the fact that he =
worked in=20
NCSA in the past makes him a little bit suspect&nbsp; (NCSA is the major =

proponent of the "In the Wild List" :-), but he gave a very good =
presentation. I=20
believe most people connected with AV testing will (silently :-) agree =
that=20
the&nbsp; "In The Wild List" is unscientific (i.e. subjective), =
misleading (if=20
used in AV scanner testing) and generally serves no identifiably useful =
purpose.=20
It's a little bit&nbsp; like the shadow of academician Lysenko's =
heritage (for=20
those lucky souls who did not know about Lysenko and Lysenkoism, see the =

definition in the "Sceptic's dictionary" at <A =
href=3D"http:///">http:///</A>). A=20
meaningful "In the wild list" is just not possible due to regional =
differences.=20
For example there is a product called V-HUNTER (<A =
href=3D"http:///">http:///</A>)=20
that for many years detected and disinfected only viruses that were =
found in=20
Russia (it does not cover polymorphic viruses - they are covered by =
DrWeb,=20
though). The list of viruses that it contains, even if we exclude =
polymorphics,=20
has very little to do with the "In the Wild List".</P>
<P>IMHO the "In the Wild List" is an artificial mix. As such,&nbsp; it =
should=20
never be used for evaluations of the quality of the AV software. Often =
it does=20
not include viruses that became widespread for a month or two (a very =
long=20
period in the AV industry). At the same time it includes viruses which =
probably=20
never managed to get into a particular country,&nbsp; and in this sense =
are no=20
different from any virus that can be found on "Virus CDs" or in =
collections=20
available via the&nbsp; Internet.</P>
<P>Although I have publicly criticized the&nbsp; "In the Wild List" =
several=20
times, nobody has taken the&nbsp; time&nbsp; to put all the relevant =
arguments=20
against it on paper. David's presentation does the job just fine. If any =

publication uses the "In the Wild List" in 1998,&nbsp; I recommend it be =
viewed=20
with great suspicion or just thrown in the garbage, where it probably =
belongs=20
;-).</P>
<P>David Stang made a good field study of virus distribution in several=20
different countries and formulated four reasons why a good wild list in =
not=20
possible<EM> (I paraphrased them as follows</EM>):=20
<OL>
  <LI><B><I>The problem of scanner precision.</I></B> Scanners are so =
imprecise=20
  that for a new virus even if two scanners report the same name (which =
is=20
  seldom the case) it is unclear whether it is the same virus, two =
strains of=20
  the&nbsp; virus or just two different viruses (one mistakenly =
misidentified=20
  due to bugs in one of the scanners).=20
  <LI><B><I>The problem of under-reporting and late reporting.</I></B> =
"In the=20
  Wild List" is not objective and relies on "good will"&nbsp; =
i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
  on the reports from&nbsp; antivirus vendors/researchers. Antivirus =
vendors are=20
  generally reluctant to release information about viruses that their =
scanners=20
  does not detect/disinfect or does not handle well. That means that =
such cases=20
  were underreported or reported late. Not only AV vendors have no real=20
  incentive to report about new cases unless they are already =
incorporated into=20
  the scanner,&nbsp;they themselves are not always able to obtain =
reliable=20
  information from their customers about infections by old viruses for =
last=20
  month, especially if the virus is disinfected by a particular scanner =
without=20
  problems&nbsp; (corporate customers are one important example; =
disclosure of=20
  such statistical information in corporations is often regulated).=20
  <LI><B><I>The problem of complete absence of proactive value.</I></B> =
Viruses=20
  can spread much faster that updates to the list.&nbsp; So "In the Wild =
List"=20
  is never up to date. Often it is seriously misrepresent the situation. =
For=20
  example if a new type of virus appears it will not be promptly =
reported. As=20
  everybody know the Concept virus took the world by surprise. But it =
took&nbsp;=20
  half a year before one half of the 27 respondent countries reported =
the virus=20
  to the "In the Wild List", even though the virus was the most =
widespread in=20
  many or all of this countries during that period.=20
  <LI><B><I>The problem of limited value as a prevalence table.</I></B> =
Purging=20
  the viruses from the list is even more arbitrary than their inclusion, =
so the=20
  list cannot be used as a reliable prevalence table. Again, AV vendors =
have=20
  neither real incentives no reliable information from customers to =
report about=20
  the disappearance of a particular virus for a particular month. =
</LI></OL>
<P>Again, IMHO the main reason is that prevalence is so different =
between=20
regions of the world that a global prevalence list make very limited =
sense=20
after, say, a dozen most widespread viruses. See below for the =
discussion of=20
Dmitry Grayznov's presentation about one possible alternative - "In The =
Usenet=20
List". It is an objective, but it has several serious problems that need =
to be=20
solved before it can be viable for AV scanners testing.</P>
<H3>Jimmy Kuo: "Free Macro Anti-virus Techniques"</H3>
<P>For some strange reason Jimmy Kuo=92s presentation was put on the =
technical=20
track. IMHO it was the most useful for practitioners presentation at the =

conference. Jimmy did a really useful job of collecting and classifying =
the=20
methods of improving macro virus protection in MS Word without using =
macro virus=20
scanners of VxD. I would like to applaud Jimmy=92s vendor =
neutral-approach that=20
was used in the paper. The text of this paper is available on <A=20
href=3D"http://www.nai.com/services/support/vr/free.asp">http://www.nai.c=
om/services/support/vr/free.asp</A>=20
&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly recommend downloading and reading it. Several =
additional=20
useful techniques should be mentioned:=20
<OL>
  <LI>Use MS Word 97, if possible. Macro viruses that have protected =
macros will=20
  NOT be converted correctly to MS Word 97 (see below);=20
  <LI>Use RTF as an alternative format for attachments.=20
  <LI>For Word 6.0 users only: Installation of SCANPROT macros in the =
STARTUP=20
  directory instead of NORMAL.DOT&nbsp; (not recommended for Word 95 =
users -=20
  they need to upgrade to Word95a or, better, Word 97;&nbsp; Word 97 =
users have=20
  the highest level of macro virus protection among MS Word users =
including the=20
  built-in functionality of SCANPROT). </LI></OL>
<P>A combination of copying the NORMAL.DOT template from a special =
backup=20
directory, SCANPROT installation in the STARTUP directory and the use of =
RTF=20
proves, as my own experience shows,&nbsp;&nbsp; to be a very inexpensive =
and=20
efficient corporate framework for fighting macro viruses. These methods =
are=20
especially useful for organizations that are afraid of using VxD for =
stability=20
reasons. </P>
<P>As for RTF, I have had a positive experience with it in a large =
corporate=20
environment, despite the fact that the CAP.A virus fools the user. This =
virus=20
saves the document in native MS Word format instead of RTF even if the =
user=20
tries to save it in RTF. At the same time, it&nbsp;&nbsp; is very easy =
to check=20
on the mail gateway (or in the mailbox) if the attachment was really =
converted=20
to RTF. One only needs to check the first 5 bytes of the file. So the =
check can=20
be really quick, much quicker than scanning the file for macro =
viruses.</P>
<H3>David Aubrey-Jones: "Macro Attacks on Office =9197"</H3>
<P>This was an interesting presentation that tried to systematize macro =
virus=20
protection features that are available in MS Word 97. Although Microsoft =
could=20
and should do more, they have made a number of important and significant =
changes=20
in Office 97 that makes the threat of macro virus infection less likely. =
The=20
following features (with the exception of &nbsp; No. 1) are generally =
poorly=20
documented and communicated to the public.=20
<OL>
  <LI>A built in macro warning dialog (like SCANPROT for Word 6.0; =
enabled by=20
  default).=20
  <LI>A scanner/disinfector built in the Word Basic converter&nbsp;=20
  (WWINT32.DLL).=20
  <LI>A feature that disables old Word Basic macro copying commands when =
the=20
  destination of the copy is locked for viewing (i.e. the project is =
password=20
  protected).=20
  <LI>The ability to protect projects can be applied to =
NORMAL.DOT,&nbsp; making=20
  it impossible for macro viruses to infect NORMAL.DOT without the user=20
  supplying the password.=20
  <LI>Execute-only macros cannot infect NORMAL.DOT (the vast majority of =
macro=20
  viruses contains =91execute-only=92 or =91protected=92 macros that =
have some=20
  (primitive) form of encryption). </LI></OL>
<P>The last feature is probably the most important. In Word 97 only =
=91projects=92=20
can be protected, while in Word 6 any single macro can be protected. =
A&nbsp;=20
Microsoft white paper "Word Basic Migration to Visual Basic for =
Applications"=20
(available as a self extracting archive wbmigrat.exe from <A=20
href=3D"http:///">http:///</A>) lists the following four important =
restrictions:=20
<OL>
  <LI>Macros in protected projects cannot be copied.=20
  <LI>Macros cannot be copied into protected projects (so if you protect =

  NORMAL.DOT it will be protected from viruses).=20
  <LI>The ExecuteOnly argument functionality of the Word Basic MacroCopy =

  statement has been disabled.=20
  <LI>The Organizer does not list macros in a protected document. =
</LI></OL>
<P>Generally, switching to Office 97 is a pretty smart move from the =
point of=20
view of macro virus protection. </P>
<H3>Dmitry Gryaznov: "Scanning the =91Net=92"</H3>
<P>VirusPatrol is a free service, provided by Dr. Solomon, to protect =
users of=20
newsgroups from virus infections by the daily scanning of major Usenet=20
newsgroups. Dmitry Gryaznov=92s project was really innovative in several =
aspects=20
and, to a certain extent, proved that Dr. Solomon is one of the market =
leaders.=20
</P>
<P>First, probably the best way for a virus author to quickly distribute =
a virus=20
is to mail it to one or several popular USENET groups. Also,&nbsp; files =
and=20
documents that contain a particular virus (for example a resume that =
contains=20
the CAP.A virus) are an indicator of a prevalence of the virus. Attached =

executables and documents are scanned using heuristic analysis. =
Suspicious=20
samples are analyzed and a detection and clean-up routine is =
incorporated in=20
FindVirus. VirusPatrol issues an alert to the newsgroup warning other =
readers=20
not to download the infected file. In this way a virus outbreak may be=20
prevented. Service is not intrusive. Readers of the scanned newsgroups =
will be=20
aware that they are being protected by Internet VirusPatrol only when an =
alert=20
is issued within that group. The list of viruses found on the scanned =
newsgroups=20
over the past two months is available via=20
http://www.drsolomon.com/vircen/vp/index.cfm. It is really&nbsp; =
instructive=20
reading. </P>
<P>The second important aspect of this pioneering work is the ability to =
create=20
something like an "In the Usenet List". I believe that Dmitry should =
take some=20
steps in this direction. There are several problems that need to be =
resolved,=20
such as the posting of virus collections and posting viruses for =
distribution in=20
provirus newsgroups. The simplest way is to exclude them. A second =
approach is=20
to introduce a rating for each virus found according to the newsgroup =
and to use=20
a&nbsp; lower rating for virus distribution newsgroups. Let's briefly =
discuss=20
four major objections mentioned above against the "In The Wild List":=20
<OL>
  <LI><B><I>The problem of scanner precision. </I></B>Still valid, =
although only=20
  one scanner is used and bugs are limited to this particular scanner. =
Still not=20
  all viruses will be reported.=20
  <LI><B><I>The problem of under-reporting and late =
reporting.</I></B>&nbsp; The=20
  list is objective and this problem seems to be less important.=20
  <LI><B><I>The problem of complete absence of proactive value. =
</I></B>Still=20
  true, but heuristics provide some (limited) proactive detection.&nbsp; =
As=20
  virus authors try to distribute viruses via USENET, a&nbsp; proactive =
value=20
  depends on the quality of the heuristics. At least some proactive =
value can be=20
  anticipated. More experience and information is needed.=20
  <LI><B><I>Problem of limited value as a prevalence =
table.</I></B>&nbsp;=20
  Probably limited for the first dozen only. More experience and =
information is=20
  needed. </LI></OL>
<H3>Martin Overton, FAT32 - New Problems for Anti-virus or Viruses?</H3>
<P>Martin Overton provided an interesting discussion of FAT32 that =
appeared in=20
the Service Pack 2 for Windows 95 and is a preferable file system for =
today=20
3G+&nbsp; hard drives. The paper is available on <A=20
href=3D"http:///">http:///</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; He demonstrated that many DOS =
viruses=20
(including MBR and boot sector (DBR) viruses) work adequately under =
Windows 95=20
and FAT32. At the same time most antivirus vendors were very slow to =
implement=20
proper handling of FAT32. </P>
<P>Some of his findings appear to be completely opposite to postings by =
notable=20
researchers on the alt.comp.virus group. The most important of them is =
that=20
DBR&nbsp; viruses<EM> really</EM> cannot be removed from FAT32 =
partitions by=20
non-FAT32 compatible anti-virus software. </P>
<P>That means that customers with FAT32 installed, who paid for such AV =
products=20
as AVP 3.0, F-prot Professional 3.0 and ThunderByte (as well as probably =
several=20
others) were paying not for protection from a large subset of boot =
viruses that=20
infect the boot sector [DBR] instead of MBR, but for vapor. Of those =
that do=20
support FAT32, both McAfee ViruScan 3.03 and Norton Antivirus 3.0 =
constantly=20
gave false positives after a cold-clean-boot [Virus found in memory]. =
Those that=20
successfully support FAT32 and didn=92t produce false alarm include: Dr. =
Solomon=92s=20
AVTK 7.72 and VET 9.44. Sophos Sweep supports FAT32, but refuses to =
remove=20
FORM.A as they consider a FAT32 partition infected with a FAT16 boot =
virus a=20
problem that requires help from their support desk. </P>
<H3>Concluding remarks</H3>
<P>IMHO one important problem was completely overlooked: the problem of =
the=20
reliability of AV products. AV products not only add to the cost of =
ownership=20
of&nbsp; the Microsoft and Novel platforms. More often that not AV =
products,=20
especially NLM s and VxD drivers, negatively affect the underling OS =
stability.=20
Like other categories of consumers, AV consumers need some kind of =
consumer=20
protection from problems like those reported by Martin Overton. The =
level of=20
testing of AV products (QA) really needs to be improved. I will add just =
one=20
