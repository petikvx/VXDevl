Version 1.6: 12th September 1999

  Significant changes from the previous version are flagged with +
  symbols in the first two columns at the start of the relevant line
  or section. Amendments of minor grammatical or syntactical errors
  are not flagged unless they affect factual accuracy or clarity.

++Sections tagged with [DH] or [SL] usually denote personal opinions
  or other data which the originator didn't feel the other
  maintainer should be held responsible for. Untagged sections using
  the first person are usually hangovers from when DH was sole
  maintainer of the FAQ.

++Sadly for the rest of us, Susan Lesch has decided to take a break
  from co-maintaining this FAQ and from maintaining her "Mac Virus"
  website, and this version of the FAQ is mainly intended to reflect
  those changes. Susan has done the lion's share of the maintenance of
  this document for the last couple of years, and done a fantastic job.
  I shall miss her input, and the Mac community will be the poorer for
  the absence of her website. Thank you, from all of us.

++I can't promise to give the FAQ the time I'd need to keep it as 
  topical as it has been, so the next revision will be focused on
  updating core material and checking URLs rather than news. What happens 
  after that depends on a number of plans that are still taking shape.

============

  This document is intended to help individuals with computer
  virus-related problems and queries, and clarify the issue
  of computer viruses on Macintosh platforms. It should *not* be
  regarded as being in any sense authoritative, and has no legal
  standing. The authors accept no responsibility for errors or

4.0  Mission Statement
======================

  This document is a little different to the alt.comp.virus FAQ,
  which David Harley also co-maintains (at time of writing). It is
  concerned with one platform only, and though it deals with the
  Macintosh platform at more length than the alt.comp.virus FAQ can
  be expected to, it is a great deal shorter. Nor is there the same
  degree of urgency about the Mac virus field, though the risk
  element may be somewhat underestimated in general, at present. This
  FAQ originated from a concern over the spread of macro viruses, a
  theme that is taken up below. Since questions about Macs and
  viruses tend to appear more often in the Mac groups than
  alt.comp.virus or Virus-L, distribution of this FAQ is wider.


5.0  Where to get further information
=====================================

5.1  Computer Virus FAQs
------------------------
  Computer Virus FAQ for New Users
  A mainly non-Mac virus FAQ posted to news.newusers.questions,
  alt.newbie, alt.newbies, alt.answers, and news.answers.
  <http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-virus/new-users/>

  alt.comp.virus FAQ
  This is posted to alt.comp.virus approximately fortnightly. It
  includes a document that summarizes and gives contact information
  for a number of other virus-related FAQs; (not much Mac-specific
  material). The latest version is available from:
  <http://www.sherpasoft.com/acvFAQ/>

  VIRUS-L/comp.virus FAQ
  The Virus-L/comp.virus FAQ (also fairly low on Mac-specific
  information) is regularly posted to the comp.virus newsgroup
  (version 2.0 at time of writing). This FAQ is very long and very
  thorough. The document is subject to revision, so the file name may
  change. The latest version may be found at:
  <ftp://ftp.infospace.com/pub/virus-l/comp.virus-FAQ.09-Oct-95>
  <ftp://ftp.datafellows.com/pub/misc/anti-vir/vlfaq200.zip>

5.2  EICAR
----------
++Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit, Virex, and NAV (Norton AntiVirus
  for Macintosh) now support the EICAR test. This article by
  Paul Ducklin of Sophos explains the EICAR test file:
  <http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm>. [SL]

5.3  "Robert Slade's Guide to Computer Viruses"
-----------------------------------------------
  The disk included with the 2nd Edition of this excellent general
  resource includes most of the information available at the
  University of Hamburg (see 5.5). The book also contains a
  reasonable quantity of Mac-friendly information. The disk includes
  a copy of Disinfectant 3.6, which is now out-of-date -- 3.7.1 is
  the latest and final release. For more information about this book:
  <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0387946632/> [Springer]

++Very few books primarily about computer viruses deal at any length
  with Mac viruses (I can't think of one, at present). Some general
  books on the Mac touch on the subject, but none I can think of add
  anything useful. Some of the "Totally Witless User's Guide
  to......." books dealing with security in general include
  information on PC -and- Mac viruses. Unfortunately, the quality of
  virus-related information in such publications is generally low, and
  there are few or no books on computer viruses in general which are 
  both recent -and- accurate.


5.4  Web sites
--------------
  Many major vendors have a virus information database online on
  their Web sites. Symantec (www.symantec.com), Network Associates
  (www.nai.com), Sophos (www.sophos.com) and Dr. Solomon's
  (www.drsolomon.com) include Macintosh virus information.

  Precise URLs tend to come and go, but you might like to try the
  following:

  Symantec Antivirus Research Center
  Virus Encyclopedia based on Project VGrep: huge, and now has a
  search engine. Probably the most complete [SL]. But not always the
  most accurate [DH]. ;-)

5.5  Virus Bulletin
-------------------
  The expensive (but, for the professional, essential) periodical
  Virus Bulletin includes Mac-specific information from time to time.
  However, if you have no interest in PC issues, you probably won't
  consider it worth the expense.

  The proceedings of the 1997 Virus Bulletin conference contained a
  paper by David Harley which significantly expands on many of the
  issues addressed in this FAQ. Contact Virus Bulletin for further
  information on the annual conference and on obtaining the
  proceedings. The paper can also be found (by permission of Virus
  Bulletin) at the author's website:

5.6  Macro virus information resources
--------------------------------------
  University of Hamburg Virus Test Center Macro Virus List is the
  definitive listing. All known macro viruses, some only found in
  research labs, some in the wild. Doesn't include information on
  individual viruses apart from name and platform.

++Richard Martin put together an FAQ on the subject of Word viruses.
  It's well out-of-date, though, and was always inaccurate in some 
  respects.

  the last released version at www.sherpasoft.com:

5.7  Other resources
--------------------
  There are excellent pages on HyperCard viruses at HyperActive
  Software. There is information on HyperCard infectors, a link to
  Bill Swagerty's free Vaccine utility for detecting and cleaning
  them, a note on false positives reported by commercial software,
  inoculation, and a free HyperCard virus detection service.
  <http://www.hyperactivesw.com/Virus1.html>

  The CIAC virus database includes entries for PC, Macintosh, and a
  number of other platforms. The Macintosh section also includes a
  number of joke programs and one or two apparent hoaxes.

  Last we checked [03-Sep-97], these sites probably need updating,
  though some older files do have historical value. Info-Mac mirrors
  have Macintosh information, but includes some outdated virus
  information and software at this writing; still, always worth a
  visit.

6.0  How many viruses affect the Macintosh?
===========================================

  There are around 40 Mac-specific viruses and related threats.

  Mac users with Word 6 or versions of Excel supporting Visual Basic
  for Applications, however, are vulnerable to infection by macro
  viruses which are specific to these applications. Indeed, these
  viruses can, potentially, infect other files on any hardware
  platform supporting these versions of these applications. I don't
  know of a macro virus with a Mac-specific payload that actually
  works at present, but such a payload is entirely possible.
++Office 98 applications are in principle vulnerable to most of the
  threats to which Office 97 applications are vulnerable. I'll return
  to this subject when and if time allows. [DH]

  Word Mac version 5.1 and below do not support WordBasic, and are
  not, therefore, vulnerable to direct infection. Not only do these
  versions not only understand embedded macros, but they can't read
  the Word 6 file format unaided. There is, however, at least one
  freeware utility which allows Word 5.x users to read Word 6 files.
  This will not support execution of Word 6 (or WinWord 2) macros in
  Word 5.x, so I would not expect either an infection routine or a
  payload routine to be able to execute within this application.

  However, Word 5.x users may contribute indirectly to the spread of
  infected files across platforms and systems, since it is perfectly
  possible for a user whose own system is uninfectable to act as a
  conduit for the transmission of infected documents, whether or not
  s/he reads it personally.

  Files infected with a PC-specific file virus (this excludes macro
  viruses) can only execute on a Macintosh running DOS or DOS/Windows
  emulation, if then. They can, of course, spread across platforms
  simply by copying infected files from one system to another.

  DOS diskettes infected with a boot sector virus can be read on a
  Mac with Apple File Exchange, PC Exchange, DOS Mounter etc. without
  (normally) risk to the Mac. However, leaving such an infected disk
  in the drive while booting an emulator such as SoftPC can mean that
  the virus attempts to infect the logical PC drive with
  unpredictable results.

  I am aware of at least one instance of a Mac diskette which, when
  read on a PC running a utility for reading Mac-formatted disks
  after being infected with a boot-sector infector, became unreadable
  as a consequence of the boot track infection.

  Some Mac viruses may damage files on Sun systems running MAE or
  AUFS.


7.0  What viruses can affect Mac users?
=======================================

  Not all variants are listed here. It was originally intended to
  reference all the major variants at least by name eventually, but
  since the information is of academic interest at best to most users
  (and available elsewhere anyway), it's no longer considered a
  priority. The main problem affecting Mac users nowadays is the
  spread of macro viruses, and I can't possibly find time to
  catalogue them individually, so they are only considered generally.
  Native Mac viruses are rather rarely seen nowadays, and most people
  don't need to know about them in detail -- in fact, what they need
  most is to know that their favoured antivirus software will deal
  with them. Note that I'm not primarily in the business of hands-on 
  virus analysis, and cannot accept responsibility for descriptive errors 
  based on third-party information. [DH]

  The following varieties are listed below:
  7.1  Mac-specific system and file infectors
  7.2  HyperCard Infectors
  7.3  Mac Trojans
  7.4  Macro viruses, trojans, variants
  7.5  Other Operating Systems, emulation on a Mac
  7.6  AutoStart 9805 Worms
  7.7  Esperanto 4733

7.1  Mac-specific system and file infectors
-------------------------------------------
  AIDS - infects application and system files. No intentional damage.
  (nVIR B strain)

  Aladin - close relative of Frankie

  Anti (Anti-A/Anti-Ange, Anti-B, Anti Variant) - can't spread under
  system 7.x, or System 6 under MultiFinder. Can damage applications
  so that they can't be 100% repaired.

  CDEF - infects desktop files. No intentional damage, and doesn't
  spread under system 7.x.

  CLAP: nVIR variant that spoofs Disinfectant to avoid detection
  (Disinfectant 3.6 recognizes it).

  Code 1: file infector. Renames the hard drive to "Trent Saburo".
  Accidental system crashes possible.

  Code 252: infects application and system files. Triggers when run
  between June 6th and December 31st. Runs a gotcha message ("You
  have a virus. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Now erasing all disks...
  [etc.]"), then self-deletes. Despite the message, no intentional
  damage is done, though shutting down the Mac instead of clicking to
  continue could cause damage. Can crash System 7 or damage files,
  but doesn't spread beyond the System file. Doesn't spread under
  System 6 with MultiFinder beyond System and MultiFinder. Can cause
  various forms of accidental damage.

  Code 9811: hides applications, replacing them with garbage files
  named "something like 'FIDVCXWGJKJWLOI'." According to Ken Dunham
  who reported this virus in November, "The most obvious symptom of
  the virus is a desktop that looks like electronic worms and a
  message that reads 'You have been hacked by the Pretorians.'"

  Code 32767: once a month tries to delete documents. This virus is
  not known to be in circulation.

  Flag: unrelated to WDEF A and B, but was given the name WDEF-C in
  some anti-virus software. Not intentionally damaging but when
  spreading it overwrites any existing 'WDEF' resource of ID '0', an
  action which might damage some files. This virus is not known to be
  in circulation.

  Frankie: only affects the Aladdin emulator on the Atari or Amiga.
  Doesn't infect or trigger on real Macs or the Spectre emulator.
  Infects application files and the Finder. Draws a bomb icon and
  displays 'Frankie says: No more piracy!"

  Fuck: infects application and System files. No intentional damage.
  (nVIR B strain)

  Init 17: infects System file and applications. Displays message
  "From the depths of Cyberspace" the first time it triggers.
  Accidental damage, especially on 68K machines.

  Init 29 (Init 29 A, B): Spreads rapidly. Infects system files,
  applications, and document files (document files can't infect other
  files, though). May display a message if a locked floppy is
  accessed on an infected system 'The disk "xxxxx" needs minor
  repairs. Do you want to repair it?'. No intentional damage, but can
  cause several problems - Multiple infections, memory errors, system
  crashes, printing problems, MultiFinder problems, startup document
  incompatibilities.

  Init 1984: Infects system extensions (INITs). Works under Systems 6
  and 7. Triggers on Friday 13th. Damages files by renaming them,
  changing file TYPE and file CREATOR, creation and modification
  dates, and sometimes by deleting them.

  Init-9403 (SysX): Infects applications and Finder under systems 6
  and 7. Attempts to overwrite whole startup volume and disk
  information on all connected hard drives. Only found on Macs
  running the Italian version of MacOS.

  Init-M: Replicates under System 7 only. Infects INITs and
  application files. Triggers on Friday 13th. Similar damage
  mechanisms to INIT-1984. May rename a file or folder to "Virus
  MindCrime". Rarely, may delete files.

  MacMag (Aldus, Brandow, Drew, Peace): first distributed as a
  HyperCard stack Trojan, but only infected System files. Triggered
  (displayed a peace message and self-deleted on March 2nd 1988, so
  very rarely found.

  MBDF (A,B): originated from the Tetracycle, Tetricycle or
  "tetris-rotating" Trojan. The A strain was also distributed in
  Obnoxious Tetris and Ten Tile Puzzle. Infect applications and
  system files including System and Finder. Can cause accidental
  damage to the System file and menu problems. A minor variant of
  MBDF B appeared in summer 1997: Disinfectant and Virex have been
  updated accordingly.

  MDEF (MDEF A/Garfield, MDEF B/Top Cat, C, D): infect System file
  and application files (D doesn't infect System). No intentional
  damage, but can cause crashes and damaged files.

  MDEF-E and MDEF-F: described as simple and benign. They infect
  applications and system files with an 'MDEF' resource ID '0', not
  otherwise causing file damage. These viruses are not known to be in
  circulation.

  nCAM: nVIR variant

  nVIR (nVIR A, B, C - AIDS, Fuck, Hpat, Jude, MEV#, nFlu): infect
  System and any opened applications. Extant versions don't cause
  intentional damage. Payload is either beeping or (nVIR A) saying
  "Don't panic" if MacInTalk is installed.

  nVIR-f: nVIR variant.

  prod: nVIR variant

  Scores (Eric, Vult, NASA, San Jose Flu): aimed to attack two
  applications that were never generally released. Can cause
  accidental damage, though - system crashes, problems printing or
  with MacDraw and Excel. Infects applications, Finder, DA Handler.

  SevenDust-A through G (MDEF 9806-A through D, also known as 666, E
  was at first called "Graphics Accelerator"): a family of five
  viruses which spread both through 'MDEF' resources and a System
  extension created by that resource. The first four variants are not
  known to be in circulation. Two of these viruses cause no other
  damage. On the sixth day of the month, MDEF 9806-B may erase all
  non-application files on the current volume. The SARC encyclopedia
  calls MDEF 9806-C, "polymorphic and encrypted, no payload," and
  MDEF 9806-D, "encrypting, polymorphic, symbiotic," and says the
  symbiotic part, "alters a 'WIND' resource from the host
  application." SevenDust E, not to be confused with the legitimate
  ATI driver "Graphics Accelerator", began as a trojan horse released
  to Info-Mac and deleted there on or about September 26, 1998. Takes
  two forms, 'INIT' resource ID '33' in an extension named
  "\001Graphics Accelerator" and an 'MDEF' resource ID '1' to '255'.
  Between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on the sixth and twelfth day of any
  month, the virus will try to delete all non-application files on
  the startup disk. John Dalgliesh describes "Graphics Accelerator"
  on his Web page for AntiGax, a free anti-SevenDust E utility; any
  errors here in translation are not his. SevenDust F uses a trojan
  "ExtensionConflict", common extensions names, and creator 'ACCE'.[SL]

  T4 (A, B, C, D): infects applications, Finder, and tries to modify
  System so that startup code is altered. Under System 6 and 7.0,
  INITs and system extensions don't load. Under 7.0.1, the Mac may be
  unbootable. Damage to infected files and altered System is not
  repairable by Disinfectant. The virus masquerades as Disinfectant,
  so as to spoof behaviour blockers such as Gatekeeper. Originally
  included in versions 2.0/2.1 of the public domain game GoMoku.

  T4-D spreads from application to application on launch by appending
  itself to the 'CODE' resource. Deletes files other than the System
  file from the System Folder, and documents, and is termed dangerous.
  The D strain is not known to be in circulation [SL].

  WDEF (A,B): infects desktop file only. Doesn't spread under System
  7. No intentional damage, but causes beeping, crashes, font
  corruption and other problems.

  zero: nVIR variant.

  Zuc (A, B, C): infects applications. The cursor moves diagonally
  and uncontrollably across the screen when the mouse button is held
  down when an infected application is run. No other intentional
  damage is done.

7.2  HyperCard infectors
------------------------
  These are a somewhat esoteric breed, but a couple have been seen
  since Disinfectant was last upgraded in 1995, and most of the
  commercial scanners detect them.

  Dukakis - infects the Home stack, then other stacks used
  subsequently. Displays the message "Dukakis for President", then
  deletes itself, so not often seen.

  HC 9507 - infects the Home stack, then other running stacks and
  randomly chosen stacks on the startup disk. On triggering, displays
  visual effects or hangs the system. Overwrites stack resources, so
  a repaired stack may not run properly.

  HC 9603 - infects the Home stack, then other running stacks. No
  intended effects, but may damage the Home stack.

  HC "Two Tunes" (referred to by some sources as "Three Tunes") -
  infects stack scripts. Visual/Audio effects: 'Hey, what are you
  doing?' message; plays the tune "Muss I denn"; plays the tune
  "Behind the Blue Mountains"; displays HyperCard toolbox and pattern
  menus; displays 'Don't panic!' fifteen minutes after activation.
  Even sources which describe this virus as "Three Tunes" seem to
  describe the symptoms consistently with the description here, but
  we will, for completeness, attempt to resolve any possible
  confusion when time allows. This virus has no known with the PC
  file infector sometimes known as Three Tunes.

  MerryXmas - appends to stack script. On execution, attempts to
  infect the Home stack, which then infects other stacks on access.
  There are several strains, most of which cause system crashes and
  other anomalies. At least one strain replaces the Home stack script
  and deletes stacks run subsequently. Variants include Merry2Xmas,
  Lopez, and the rather destructive Crudshot. [Ken Dunham discovered
  the merryXmas virus. His program merryxmasWatcher 2.0 was very
  popular and still can eradicate the most common two strains,
  merryXmas and merry2Xmas. merryxmasWatcher 2.0 is outdated for the
  rest this family.]

  Antibody is a recent virus-hunting virus which propagates between
  stacks checking for and removing MerryXmas, and inserting an
  inoculation script.

  Independance (sic) Day - reported in July, 1997. It attempts to
  to be destructive, but fortunately is not well enough written to be
  more than a nuisance. More information at:
  <http://www.hyperactivesw.com/Virus1.html#IDay>

  Blink - reported in August, 1998. Nondestructive but spreads;
  infected stacks blink once per second starting in January, 1999.

7.3  Mac Trojan Horses
----------------------
  These are often unsubtle and immediate in their effects: while
  these effects may be devastating, Trojans are usually very
  traceable to their point of entry. The few Mac-specific Trojans are
  rarely seen, but of course the commercial scanners generally detect
  them.

  ChinaTalk - system extension - supposed to be sound driver, but
  actually deletes folders.

  CPro - supposed to be an update to Compact Pro, but attempts to
  format currently mounted disks.

+ ExtensionConflict - supposed to identify Extensions conflicts, but
  installs one of the six SevenDust a.k.a. 666 viruses.

  FontFinder - supposed to lists fonts used in a document, but
  actually deletes folders.

  MacMag - HyperCard stack (New Apple Products) that was the origin
  of the MacMag virus. When run, infected the System file, which then
  infected System files on floppies. Set to trigger and self-destruct
  on March 2nd, 1988, so rarely found.

  Mosaic - supposed to display graphics, but actually mangles
  directory structures.

  NVP - modifies the System file so that no vowels can be typed.
  Originally found masquerading as 'New Look', which redesigns the
  display.

  Steroid - Control Panel - claims to improve QuickDraw speed, but
  actually mangles the directory structure.

  Tetracycle - implicated in the original spread of MBDF

  Virus Info - purported to contain virus information but actually
  trashed disks. Not to be confused with Virus Reference.

  Virus Reference 2.1.6 mentions an 'Unnamed PostScript hack' which
  disables PostScript printers and requires replacement of a chip on
  the printer logic board to repair. A Mac virus guru says:

  "The PostScript 'Trojan' was basically a PostScript job that
  toggled the printer password to some random string a number of
  times.  Some Apple laser printers have a firmware counter that
  allows the password to only be changed a set number of times
  (because of PRAM behavior or licensing -- I don't remember which),
  so eventually the password would get "stuck" at some random string
  that the user would not know.  I have not heard any reports of
  anyone suffering from this in many years."

  AppleScript Trojans - A demonstration destructive compiled
  AppleScript was posted to the newsgroups alt.comp.virus,
  comp.sys.mac.misc, comp.sys.mac.system, it.comp.macintosh,
  microsoft.public.word.mac, nl.comp.sys.mac, no.mac, and
  symantec.support.mac.sam.general on 16-Aug-97, apparently in
  response to a call for help originally posted to alt.comp.virus on
  14-Aug-97 and followup on 15-Aug-97. On 03-Sep-97, MacInTouch
  published Xavier Bury's finding of a second AppleScript trojan
  horse, which, like the call for help followup, mentioned Hotline
  servers. It reportedly sends out private information while running
  in the background. A note to users from Hotline Communications CEO
  Adam Hinkley is posted at
  <http://www.macvirus.com/news/press/970903a.html>.
  AppleScripts should be downloaded only from known trusted sources.
  It is nigh impossible for an average person to know what any given
  compiled script will do.

7.4  Macro viruses, trojans, variants
-------------------------------------
  At the time of the longstanding second-to-last upgrade of
  Disinfectant (version 3.6 in early 1995), there were no known macro
  viruses in the wild, apart from HyperCard infectors. In any case,
  Disinfectant was always intended to deal with system viruses, not
  trojans or macro/script viruses. However, many users are unaware of
  these distinctions and still assume that Disinfectant is a complete
  solution, even after its effective demise (in fact, there were
  people still relying on Gatekeeper long after its author disowned
  it....).

++Unfortunately, the number of known macro viruses runs into several
  thousand, though the number in the wild is far fewer.

  Most macro viruses (if they have a warhead at all) target Intel
  platforms and assume FAT-based directory structures, so they
  usually have no discernible effect on Macs when they trigger.
  Viruses that manipulate text strings within a document may work
  just as well on a Macintosh as on a PC.

  In any case, the main costs of virus control are not recovery from
  virus payloads, but the costs of establishing detection and
  protection (or of not establishing them). The costs of not
  establishing these measures can be considerable, irrespective of
  damage caused on infected machines, especially in corporate
  environments. Secondary distribution of infected documents may
  result in:

  * civil action - for instance, inadvertent distribution of an
    infected document to external organisations may be in breach of
    contractual obligations

  * legal action in terms of breach of data-protection legislation
    such as the UK Data Protection Act or the European Data Protection
    directive. The eighth principle of the Data Protection Act, for
    instance, requires that security measures are taken to protect
    against unauthorised access to, and alteration, disclosure and
    destruction of personal data, or its accidental loss.

  * damage to reputation - no legitimate organisation wants to be
    seen as being riddled with viruses.

  Since Word 6.x for Macintosh supports WordBasic macros, it is as
  vulnerable as Word 6.x and 7.x on Intel platforms to being infected
  by macro viruses, and therefore to generating other infected
  documents (or, strictly speaking, templates). Working Excel viruses
  are now beginning to appear also, and any future Macintosh
  application that supports Visual Basic for Applications will also
  be vulnerable. Note also that the possibility of virus-infected
  files embedded as objects in files associated with other
  applications: this possibility exists on any platform that supports
  OLE.

++Office 98 is in general vulnerable to infection by most viruses which
  affect corresponding applications in Office 97. 

  Macro viruses are therefore highly transmissible via
  Macintoshes, even if they don't have a destructive effect on
  Motorola platforms, if there is an equivalent application
  available on the Macintosh. For instance, although Word for
  Windows versions before vs. 6 support WordBasic, Word
  versions for the Mac up to and including version 5.1 do not.
  [Thus Word 5.1 users can not be directly infected, but may,
  like anyone, pass on infected documents to vulnerable systems.]

++[reference to Green Stripe removed]

  Network Associates, Symantec, and Intego all make known-virus
  scanners that detect a range of macro viruses. Microsoft make
  available a free 'protection tool' whose effectiveness is often
  overestimated. (See below.)

  For further information on specific macro viruses, try one of the
  information resources given earlier.

7.5  Other Operating Systems, emulation on a Mac
------------------------------------------------
  Any Mac running any sort of DOS or Windows emulation such as
  Virtual PC, SoftPC, SoftWindows, RealPC, or a DOS compatibility
  card is a potential target for any PC virus, including Boot Sector
  Infectors/Multipartites; (effects will vary). It is highly
  recommended that anyone with such a system should run a reputable,
  up-to-date PC antivirus program under emulation, as well as a good
  Mac antivirus program. [Dr. Solomon's for the Mac detects PC boot
  sector infectors as well as Mac viruses, but doesn't detect PC file
  viruses (apart from macro viruses), and so is not sufficient
  protection for a Mac with DOS emulation.]

  Recommendations for defending PC systems or PC emulation on Macs
  are slightly out-of-scope for this FAQ. In fact, I don't know of
  any formal testing for PC antivirus software in the context of PC
  emulation on Macs. I've done some informal testing (referred to in
  another paper), but am not prepared to make vendor-specific
  recommendations on the basis of such testing. F-Prot, AVP, and Dr
  Solomon's are particularly well-regarded PC antivirus packages, of
  which some components on some platforms are available as freeware
  or for evaluation, but their efficacy in the context of PC
  emulation is not well tested or documented.

7.6  AutoStart 9805 Worms
-------------------------
  AutoStart 9805 is not a virus, but a worm: that is, it replicates
  by copying itself, but doesn't attach itself parasitically to a
  host program. The original took hold rapidly in Hong Kong and
  Taiwan in April 1998, and has been reported on at least four
  continents. In addition to the original worm, there are five
  variants. Virus Bulletin, July, 1998, includes a comprehensive
  analysis of AutoStart and some of its variants.

  CIAC Bulletin I-067 is based on Eugene Spafford's information
  release on the original AutoStart worm. Unfortunately,this is now a
  little out-of-date, particularly as regards the update status of
  the antivirus software it mentions. Nor does it mention any of the
  subsequently discovered variants.
  <http://www.ciac.org/>

  Symptoms: Perhaps the most noticeable symptom of the worms is that
  an infected system will _lock up and churn with unexplained disk
  activity_ every 6, 10, or 30 minutes.[SL]

  Affected platforms: any PowerMac. Macintoshes and clones driven by
  Motorola 680x0 series CPUs can't run the replicative code. It works
  under any version of Mac OS, if QuickTime 2.0 or later is installed
  and CD-ROM AutoPlay is enabled in the "QuickTime Settings" Control
  Panel.

  Transmission media: HFS or HFS+ volumes (hard disks, diskettes,
  most types of removable media, even disk images). Audio CDs can't
  transmit the virus, and it isn't necessary to disable "Audio CD
  AutoPlay".

  Transmission method: infected media contain an invisible
  application file named "DB" or "BD" or "DELDB" in the root
  directory (type APPL, creator ????). This is an AutoStart file:
  i.e. it will run automatically if CD-ROM autoplay is enabled. If
  the host Mac isn't already infected, it copies itself to the
  Extensions folder. The new copy is renamed "Desktop Print Spooler"
  or "Desktop Printr Spooler", or "DELDesktop Print Spooler"
  respectively (type appe, creator ????). Unlike the legitimate
  Desktop Printer Spooler extension, the worm file has the invisible
  attribute set, and isn't listed as a running process by the system
  software, though it can be seen with Process Watcher or Macsbug.
  After copying itself, it reboots the system and is now launched
  every time the system restarts. At approximately 6, 10, or 30
  minute intervals, it examines mounted volumes to see if they're
  infected: if not, it writes itself to the root directory and sets
  up AutoStart (however, AutoStart won't work on a server volume).

  Damage: files with names ending "data", "cod" or "csa" are targeted
  if the data fork is larger than 100 bytes. Files with names ending
  "dat" are targeted if the whole file is c. 2Mb or larger. Targeted
  files are attacked by overwriting the data fork (up to the 1st Mb)
  with garbage.

  Besides the original, there are five variants: AutoStart 9805-B,
  which is less noticeable but can cause irreparable damage to files
  of type 'JPEG', 'TIFF', and 'EPSF'; AutoStart 9805-C and AutoStart
  9805-D which do not intentionally damage data; AutoStart 9805-E
  which spreads like B and is most similar to the original; and
  AutoStart 9805-F which is most similar to A and E.
  Dr Solomon's, Sophos, and Symantec had descriptions on the Web:
  <http://www.drsolomon.com/vircen/valerts/mac/>
  <http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/autostart9805.html>
  <http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/data/autostart.9805.html> 
++Dead Mac Virus link cleaned.

  Detection: updates to deal with the worms are available for Virex
  (http://www.drsolomon.com/products/virex/), for NAV and SAM
  (http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/download.html), and for Rival
  (http://www.intego.com/). 

++The last versions of VirusScan for Mac and Disinfectant did not detect
  AutoStart. [Reference to Dr Solomon's for Mac removed, as the product is
  no longer supported.]

  Prevention: uninfected systems can be protected by disabling the
  AutoStart option in QuickTime settings (QuickTime 2.5 or later only
  - earlier versions don't have a disable option). This should also
  prevent infection by future malware exploiting the same loophole,
  but will fail if a setup is booted from a volume with an infected
  Extensions Folder [SL].

  Removal: the easiest and safest method for most people will be to
  use the updated version of their favoured anti-virus software, as
  it becomes available.

  The worms can be also be removed manually.
  * Reboot with extensions disabled (hold down the shift key till an
    alert box tells you that extensions are off).
  * Use Find File to search all volumes for all instances of a file
    called "DB" or "BD" or "DELDB" with the invisibility attribute set
    (hold down Option key when clicking on "Name" pop-up menu to select
    for visibility). Trash 'em.
  * Use Find File to find and trash an invisible "Desktop Print
    Spooler", "Desktop Printr Spooler", or "DELDesktop Print Spooler"
    file (-not- Desktop Printer Spooler, which is a legitimate and
    usually necessary system file).
  * Empty the trash.
  * Disable AutoStart in QuickTime Settings Control Panel.
  * Restart.

7.7  Esperanto.4733
-------------------
++This probably doesn't belong here. It's a PC file infector which
  works with a number of PC executable file formats. When it was
  first seen, it was reported to be a multiplatform virus capable of
  executing under some circumstances on Macintoshes. Subsequent
  reports indicate that this belief results from misinformation on
  the part of the author. However, at least two reputable PC
  anti-virus vendors still list it as capable of activating on a
  Macintosh. No Mac scanner is known to attempt to detect it.

8.0  What's the best antivirus package for the Macintosh?
=========================================================

  As ever, we can't give a definitive answer to this. The best choice
  depends on subjective criteria and individal needs. Nonetheless,
  Here are some thoughts on the main contenders.

8.1  Microsoft's Protection Tools
---------------------------------
  Microsoft's Macro Virus Protection Tools originally detected
  Concept (Nuclear and DMV were also mentioned in the documentation,
  but were not identified specifically by the tools). Principally,
  they merely warned users that the document they are about to open
  contained macros and offered the choice of opening the file without
  macros, opening it with macros, or cancelling the File Open. Later
  implementations built into the application are better on
  identifying a few specific viruses and on integration into Word
  itself, but should not be relied on for 100% effective detection,
  blocking and disinfection of macro viruses. More information from
  Microsoft may be available at the addresses below.
  <http://www.microsoft.com/office/antivirus/> (no longer accessible)
  MSN: GO MACROVIRUSTOOL
  AOL: the Word forum
  CompuServe: the Word forum
  Microsoft Product Support Services
  206-462-9673 (WinWord)
  206-635-7200 (Word Mac)
  email: wordinfo@microsoft.com

  NB The Protection Tool traps some File Open operations, but not
  all. There are a number of ways of opening a document which bypass
  it, some of which are rather commonly used (e.g. double-clicking or
  using the Recent Documents list).

  The Protection Tool can be used to scan for Concept-infected files,
  but there are a number of possible problems with it.

  * Earlier versions could only handle a limited size of directory
    tree, and ran very slowly if a large number of files required
    scanning. Speed is certainly still a problem: I can't say about the
    overflow problem.
  * Files created in Word for Windows won't be scanned until they've
    been opened in Word 6 for Mac (this is a system issue, not a bug in
    the code). However, Microsoft suggest that you open the file in
    Word for the Macintosh and save it before scanning. This will do
    the job, but will also infect your system, if the file is infected.
    If it's infected with a virus -other- than Concept, this could
    create problems if the Protection Tool is bypassed on a subsequent
    file open.
  * Infected files embedded in OLE2 files or e-mail files will not be
    detected.
  * The Microsoft tools are not useful on non-English Windows systems
    (which may be run under Virtual PC or Real PC). SCANPROT cannot
    handle non-English documents, and will hang during the scanning
    process if it encounters a document created with a non-English
    version of Word. Microsoft's Excel add-in for the Laroux macro
    virus causes multiple file open buttons to appear in non-English
    versions of Excel, and so it has worse effects than the macro virus
    itself. Again this applies to Windows emulation; however, most
    virus protection and detection products are only tested in an
    English language environment, and may cause problems on non-English
    systems. [Thanks to Eric Hildum for this information.]

  Windows 95 users should be aware that SCANPROT is not recommended
  for use with MS Word 7.0a for Windows with internal detection
  enabled, as these two tools will cancel each other out.

  The Excel add-in for Macs removes only Laroux A and B.
  <http://www.microsoft.com/macoffice/laroux.htm>

  Office 98 moves the goalposts again. This issue will probably be
  addressed again here in more depth. In brief, Office 98 does a
  better job of implementing a primarily generic approach [i.e. "If
  it contains macros, it's suspicious: sort it out yourself...."],
  but whether this is enough is a question demanding more space and
  time than I have to spare right now [DH].

  Microsoft's home page has recommended using an ICSA-certified
  antivirus utility and sidesteps any hint of responsibility for any
  macro virus or SCANPROT related problems.
  (1) not everyone is happy with the current implementation of ICSA (NCSA)
  certification
  (2) ICSA certification is not at present Mac-aware.

8.2  Disinfectant
-----------------
  [On May 6th 1998, John Norstad, author of this widely-used freeware
  package announced that it was to be retired. 3.7.1 is the latest
  and last version, and it won't be updated to detect AutoStart 9805
  or any subsequent Macintosh malware. The main reason for this is
  that he doesn't have the resources to extend its capabilities to
  detect macro viruses, which have become by far the most significant
  virus problem for most Macintosh users.

  This is probably a wise decision, given the number of people who
  still overestimate the effectiveness of the package in the face of
  the macro virus threat. However, the entire Macintosh community
  owes John Norstad a debt of gratitude for making it freely
  available for so long, an act of altruism which has probably
  contributed very significantly to the comparative rarity of native
  Macintosh viruses.]

  Disinfectant was an excellent anti-virus package with exemplary
  documentation, and didn't cost a penny: however, it didn't detect
  all the forms of malware that a commercial package usually does,
  including HyperCard infectors, most Trojans, jokes or macro
  viruses. Unlike some commercial packages, it didn't scan compressed
  files, either: compressed files had to be expanded before scanning.
  Self-extracting archives were probably best scanned before
  unpacking, then again when unpacked.

  Disinfectant has been available up to now from the following
  sources, but this may not continue to be the case.:
  <ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/disinfectant/>
  CompuServe
  GEnie
  America Online
  Calvacom
  Delphi
  BIX
  Info-Mac mirrors in the ../vir/ directory

  The Disinfectant README was updated to README-IMPORTANT on 6 May
  1998, with the message, "because of the widespread and dangerous
  Microsoft macro virus problem," "...All Disinfectant users should
  switch..." to another program. README-IMPORTANT was updated again
  on 11 October 1998, adding, "In addition to the Autostart worm and
  the Microsoft macro viruses, several other new Mac viruses have
  appeared since Disinfectant's retirement in May. This makes it even
  more important that Disinfectant users switch..." to one of the
  commercial products.
  <ftp://ftp.nwu.edu/pub/disinfectant/README-IMPORTANT>
  There is a copy of the retirement announcement on the Web:
  <http://charlotte.acns.nwu.edu/jln/d-retire.ssi>

8.3  Demo Software
------------------
  Symantec has a 30-day fully-functioning trialware NAV (Norton
  AntiVirus for Macintosh). Update it with current definitions.
  <http://www.symantec.com/nav/fs_navmac5.html>

  Network Associates has a 30-day fully-functioning evaluation
  version of Virex 5.9.1. The Virex trial includes the application,
  not the control panel.
  <ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/antivirus/mac/virex/>
  Update the demo with current definitions:
  <ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/antivirus/datfiles/mac/virex/>.

  Sophos also has a 30-day evaluation, also fully-functioning,
  which includes the SWEEP application. The demo supports both
  English and Japanese.
  <http://www.sophos.com/downloads/eval/savmac.html>

  Intego has a limited-function French demo of Rival, "miniRival."
  <http://www.intego.com/demo.html>

  Disinfector 1.0 is described by its author as shareware. However,
  it's strictly speaking a limited-runtime demo -- it stops
  functioning after 20 trial runs on one system. It's described as a
  beta release, but the author expects users to register it at a
  charge of $30 [subsequently reduced to $15]: in return, they get a
  version which can be used an unlimited number of times. It only
  detects a handful of Mac system viruses which the author claims
  that commercial vendors have not detected, and have not been
  reported in the wild. In the early days of virus/antivirus
  technology, a number of utilities were made available which
  addressed only one or a few viruses, and a proliferation of free
  AutoStart worm detectors continues that honourable tradition.
  However, charging for this particular utility puts it into the same
  arena as the commercial scanners which detect a far wider range of
  threats and for which full support is available, an area in which
  it cannot at present compete. Disinfector was briefly available at
  Info-Mac, but has since been removed.

  There have also been a number of proposals since John Norstad
  announced the retirement of Disinfectant, suggesting that if the
  code was made public, it would be possible to maintain and further
  develop Disinfectant, possibly still as a freeware product. This is
  misguided, for a number of reasons.

  * It misses one of the main points of Norstad's announcement, which
    is to acknowledge the dangers of continuing to develop a scanner
    which detects only one class of virus, when so many people have
    laboured so long under the misapprehension that it was a complete
    solution.
  * Disinfectant -has- been developed further. VirusScan is based on
    Disinfectant technology (under licence), and NAI are in a much
    better position to develop it as commercial-grade software than a
    group of well-meaning individuals without the specialised skills
    and resources of a mainstream anti-virus development team. Indeed,
    it may be that the terms of that agreement would prevent Norstad
    from making the code public even if he wanted to (I doubt that he
    does....).
  * Making the code public, even to a limited circle, would increase
    the chances of its falling into irresponsible hands. In fact, the
    online documentation has long stated that the code for the
    detection engine is not available, though some of the interface
    code was. (I'm paraphrasing from memory: I may well check out
    exactly what it says for the next update of the FAQ.)
  * To think that a committee of well-intentioned amateurs (or a
    single ambitious amateur can develop Disinfectant to the same high
    standard that it achieved through its lifetime demonstrates a
    profound underestimation of the difficulties of maintaining (let
    alone creating) a first-class known-virus scanner. [DH]

8.4  Other freeware/shareware packages
--------------------------------------
  For other freeware\shareware Mac packages, try Info-Mac mirrors
  like:
  <ftp://ftp.ucs.ubc.ca/pub/mac/info-mac/vir/>

  The University of Texas holds some older documentation on Mac
  viruses.
  <http://wwwhost.ots.utexas.edu/mac/pub-mac-virus.html>

  Tracker INIT and DelProtect INIT, both by Ioannis Galidakis, were
  first released on 19-Nov-98. Tracker is a behavior blocker something
  like the retired program GateKeeper. DelProtect protects against
  malicious file deletion. Tracker is now at version 1.1. Scanner 1.1x
  also by Ioannis Galidakis was released 15-Jan-99, and is a free,
  generic, heuristic 68k virus scanner for advanced Macintosh users.
  <http://www.crosswinds.net/athens/~jgal/>

  John Dalgliesh has created Agax, an extensible, free anti-virus
  program which replaces his program AntiGax, and uses plug-ins called
  "Additives." At this time, Agax will detect and try to clean only
  SevenDust, CODE 9811, and the AutoStart worms (the worm additive was
  in beta testing at the time of this writing). The author's Web page
  and documentation invite Mac programmers to contribute additives.
  <http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2191331/agax/agax.html>

  The Exorcist, free from Laffey Computer Imaging, may give some (by
  one description, about 90%) protection from the SevenDust family.
  <http://www.laffeycomputer.com/software.html>

  Gatekeeper was not a scanner, but a generic tool. It is no longer
  supported by its author, but is still available on some sites. It
  is probably not safe to use or rely on on modern systems, and I
  believe the author recommends that people don't attempt to use it,
  though I've been unable to contact him to get confirmation.

  In January 1997 Padgett Peterson, author of the PC utility
  DiskSecure, released the first version of his MacroList macro
  detection tool, which has been tested by the author on Macs (System
  7.5 on SE/30, IIci and PowerMac) as well as Windows PCs, using
  considerably more macro viruses than Microsoft seem to have heard
  of..... The MacroList template is accessed by a button in the
  standard toolbar. This is not a virus scanner, but allows disabling
  of automacros, listing of any macros found in the current document
  etc. Version 1.10 was due for release by the time of writing
  (February 1997), and an adaptation for Office97 is in progress.
  Watch the Web page for further details. [v1.1 and the Office 97
  "late beta" were available as at 18th March 1997.] MacroList is
  freeware, but please be sure to read the TRIALS link.

  WormGuard by Clarence Locke is a free on-access extension that
  affords AutoStart worm protection:
  <http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/NewSearch?key=WormGuard>

  The following free scanners may remove AutoStart 9805 and its B, C,
  D, E, and F variants and may be useful in the absence of a
  commercial application. There are a few reported instances of
  failures by some of these programs to identify or remove the
  AutoStart worms, and it is likely that D might be mis-identified as
  C, and E may be mis-identified as the original worm. [SL]

  As stated above, one-shot solutions to a very small subset of a
  particular class of threat have a long and honourable history, and
  are very welcome when a new threat catches the antivirus developers
  on the hop (it can take some time to incorporate detection of new
  threats into the product update cycle). NB The maintainer does not
  currently have the time or resources to do full detection testing of 
  these products (or any other). [DH]

8.5  Commercial Packages
------------------------
  Commercial packages include NAV (Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh)
  [NAV supersedes SAM (Symantec Antivirus for Macintosh)], Virex for
  Macintosh, Rival, and Sophos Anti-Virus for Macintosh (SAV).

  Virex, NAV, and SAM all address a full range of threats, including
  Trojans and macro viruses, and can do scheduled scanning as well as
  on-access (memory-resident) scanning.

++Sophos Anti-Virus for Macintosh (SAV) was upgraded in January 1999
  to include the SWEEP on-demand scanner. The shipping version can be
  downloaded for free evaluation. English and Japanese are supported.
  <http://www.sophos.com/downloads/eval/> Stand-alone on-access scanning
  is not yet available in the release version, but is now in beta. 
  Server-based on-access scanning is already available for Mac clients
  on NT or NetWare networks.
  The program offers customizable reporting and notification from an
  attractive interface. So far, compressed archives must be
  decompressed before scanning; I am assured that archive scanning
  will be in future versions. Complete documentation is in PDF format.
  <http://www.sophos.com/support/docs/>
+ Sophos combines an intercept driver (InterCheck) and a scanner
  application (SWEEP). Sales are not retail, but direct or through
  the Sophos Distributor network. Free technical support is all-year
  round, any time of day. Virus identity updates are available from
  the Web between monthly CD-ROMs. Major developments in the Sophos
  product are expected, including smooth large-scale deployment and
  ease of updating over networks.[SL]

  Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh (NAV) launched May 18, 1998. New
  features included LiveUpdate virus definition updates over the
  Internet, enhanced macro virus protection, automatic file repair, a
  bootable CD-ROM for emergencies, faster scanning for PPC, and a
  universal SafeZone.

  NAV, SAM, and Virex offer checksumming/integrity checking
  (detecting possible infection by unknown viruses, by monitoring
  changes in infectable files) - the correct checksums or
  fingerprints for individual files are kept in a database file. All
  three applications check files compressed with StuffIt.

  NAV, formerly SAM, is particularly oriented towards behaviour
  blocking: the Intercept tool can be configured to raise an alert at
  the slightest whiff of a 'suspicious' operation. Unfortunately,
  this can be counterproductive in real life, since an over-stringent
  alert policy is apt to result in the facility being turned off
  altogether. However, configuration is very flexible.

  SAM (Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh) support was discontinued
  May 1; the last update is for July '99. From Symantec's advice:
   "In order to maintain the safety and security of your data
    from viruses without interruption, we recommend that you
    upgrade to NAVM 5.0.3 before May 1st. For presales and
    upgrade questions, please contact customer service. They
    can be reached at 800-441-7234 or online at:"
    <http://www.symantec.com/custserv/>

  [SAM 4.5.x needs the 4.5->4.5.1 application patch to run current
  definitions, and the 4.5.3 Intercept patch to resolve a compatibility
  issue with Microsoft Office 98, and Segment Loader errors when
  Intercept loads.
  <http://service.symantec.com/sam/>
  <http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/num.nsf/docid/19978714255>
  SAM application Minimum and Preferred memory allocations must be
  increased from their shipping defaults to 5000K or greater. The
  (May 1998) SAM definitions files included a Read Me with
  instructions. More information may be available from Symantec SAM
  support on the Web.]

  Symantec issued a Norton AntiVirus 5.x->5.0.3 patch for Mac OS 8.5,
  fixing the problem with copying files on AppleShare networks.
  <http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/files/navm/
  norton_antivirus_for_macintosh.html>

  Virex offers very fast scanning is easy to update, and includes
  checksumming for the detection of unknown viruses. It's also
  possible to buy an administration package. The basic package
  includes a control panel for scanning on file or diskette access
  which can be locked independently of the administration package.
  Installation and interface are easy and efficient. Virex 5.8 scans
  ZIP archives, has a contextual menu plug-in module, and interface
  enhancements.

  Virex 5.9.1 was released on 18-Jan-99, for compatibility with
  Mac OS 8.5 and Virex Administrator 1.4, and can be downloaded.
  <http://www.drsolomon.com/download/home/>. Registered users who
  bought McAfee VirusScan during the past six months or so, and
  registered users of Virex 5.8 and 5.9 could still upgrade:
  <http://www.nai.com/products/antivirus/virex_mac.asp>.
  Virex Administrator version 1.4 was released by NAI on 23-Dec-98.
  Virex and Virex Administrator had these home pages:
  <http://www.drsolomon.com/products/virex/index.cfm>
  <http://www.drsolomon.com/products/vadmin/index.cfm>
++A new release is in beta.

  Dr Solomon's Software acquired Virex and netOctopus from Datawatch
  Corp. on 10-Oct-97. Network Associates (NAI) acquired Dr Solomon's
  on 13-Aug-98. Netopia, Inc., acquired what is now named Timbuktu
  netOctopus in late '98 or early '99. 

++VirusScan 3.0.1 is the final version for Macintosh, and may be
  updated for macro viruses into 1999, but will never have AutoStart
  worm definitions or definitions for the new System viruses like
  SevenDust E. VirusScan customers need to take advantage of a free
  upgrade to Virex as soon as possible. 

++Dr. Solomon's for Macintosh went through various stages of neglect
  through late 1998 and support appears to have vanished altogether in
  1999, when customers started to receive Virex disks instead of Dr.
  Solly's updates.

  Rival 3.0.4 is available from Intego.
  <http://www.intego.com/>

++F-Secure for Macintosh is one of the best-kept secrets in anti-virus.
  The last time I saw it, it detected macro viruses only. You might be
  lucky and find some reference to it at:

++Details on DataFellows will be included when I've determined the current
  status of F-Secure for Macintosh.


9.0  Welcome Datacomp
=====================

  From time to time there are reports from Mac users that the message
  'Welcome Datacomp' appears in their documents without having been
  typed. This is the result of using a Trojanised 3rd-party
  Mac-compatible keyboard with this 'joke' hard-coded into the
  keyboard ROM. It's not a virus - it cannot infect anything. The
  only cure is to replace the keyboard (be polite but firm with the
  dealer if you were sold this as a new keyboard!).


10.0  Hoaxes and myths
======================

  Some of these are PC-specific, rather than Mac-specific, while some
  have no basis in reality on any system. [I look forward to hearing
  about the first Turing machine infector....] They are included here
  (a) because Mac support staff are accustomed to being asked about
  them (b) because anything that -might- work on a real PC -might-
  also work with DOS emulation, in principle.
++This section may vanish in the near future, or at least contract. 
  The hoax business has changed a lot since this FAQ began.

10.1  Good Times virus
----------------------
  There is *no* Good Times virus that trashes your hard disk and
  launches your CPU into an nth-complexity binary loop when you read
  mail with "Good Times" in the Subject: field.

  You can get a copy of the latest version of Les Jones' FAQ on the
  Good Times Hoax on the World Wide Web:
  <http://www.public.usit.net/lesjones/goodtimes.html>

  There's a Mini-FAQ available as:
  <http://www.public.usit.net/lesjones/gtminifaq.html>

10.2  Modems and Hardware viruses
---------------------------------
  There is no modem virus that spreads via an undocumented subcarrier
  - whatever that means.... There is no virus that causes damage to
  hardware.

10.3  Email viruses
-------------------
  Any file virus can be transmitted as an E-mail attachment. However,
  the virus code has to be executed before it actually infects.
  Sensibly configured mailers and browsers don't allow this: check
  yours. In particular, check that your Web browser doesn't
  automatically pass Word documents to Word 6 to open, since this may
  result in embedded macros being launched.

10.4  JPEG/GIF viruses
----------------------
  There is no known way in which a virus could sensibly be spread by
  a graphics file such as a JPEG or .GIF file, which does not contain
  executable code. Macro viruses work because the files to which they
  are attached are not 'pure' data files.

10.5  Hoaxes Help
-----------------
  If you should receive a virus warning, look at these sites before
  forwarding it along (in fact, it's probably never justified to pass
  on a virus alert indiscriminately, and reputable antivirus
  companies don't do this. In fact, the information that such and
  such a virus exists is not, in itself, useful to the average
  computer user, even if it does. A statement like, "Please forward
  to everyone!" is one mark of a hoax.

  Corporates who haven't sorted out their hoax management strategy
  might get some mileage out of my mini-paper on "Dealing with
  Internet Hoaxes", though it's getting a bit long in the tooth. It
  is, however, one of the few papers on the subject which deals with
  it from an adminstrator's/manager's point of view as well as from
  an everyday user/victim's. [DH]

11.0  Glossary
==============

  * Change Detectors/Checksummers/Integrity Checkers - programs that
    keep a database of the characteristics of all executable files on a
    system and check for changes which might signify an attack by an
    unknown virus.
  * Cryptographic Checksummers use an encryption algorithm to lessen
    the risk of being fooled by a virus that targets that particular
    checksummer.
  * Dropper - a program that installs a virus or Trojan, often
    covertly.
  * Generic - catch-all name for antivirus software that doesn't know
    about individual viruses, but attempts to detect viruses by
    detecting virus-like code, behaviour, or changes in files
    containing executable code.
  * Heuristic scanners - scanners that inspect executable files for
    code using operations that might denote an unknown virus.
  * Monitor/Behaviour Blocker - a TSR that monitors programs while
    they are running for behaviour which might denote a virus.
  * Scanner (conventional scanner, command-line scanner, on-demand
    scanner) - a program that looks for known viruses by checking for
    recognisable patterns ('scan strings', 'search strings',
    'signatures') or using a more flexible algorithmic approach for
    detection of polymorphic viruses, which can't be found by a search
    for a simple scan string. These are not usually associated with the
    Macintosh platform, but there are Word Macro viruses which exhibit
    mutation.
  * Trojan (Trojan Horse) - a program intended to perform some covert
    and usually malicious act that the victim did not expect or want.
    It differs from a destructive virus in that it doesn't reproduce,
    (though this distinction is by no means universally accepted).
  * Virus - a program (a block of executable code) that attaches
    itself to, overwrites or otherwise replaces another program in
    order to reproduce itself without the knowledge of the computer
    user. Most viruses are comparatively harmless, and may be present
    for years with no noticeable effect: some, however, may cause
    random damage to data files (sometimes insidiously, over a long
    period) or attempt to destroy files and disks. Others cause
    unintended damage. Even benign viruses (apparently non-destructive
    viruses) cause significant damage by occupying disk space and/or
    main memory, by using up CPU processing time, by introducing the
    risk of incompatibilities and conflicts, and by the time and
    expense wasted in detecting and removing them.


12.0  General Reference Section
===============================

12.1  Mac Newsgroups
--------------------
  comp.sys.mac.apps
  comp.sys.mac.comm
  comp.sys.mac.misc
  comp.sys.mac.system

  comp.virus
  alt.comp.virus

  The focus on these two groups tends to be IBM-compatible, but Mac
  issues are certainly aired. Alt.comp.virus is unmoderated, and the
  quality of the advice and opinions aired there is very variable -
  there are many reputable and expert posters, and many mischievous
  and misleading contributions. Caveat lector.... comp.virus lies 
  dormant for years at a time, but is well worth watching when there's
  anything there.

13.0  Mac troubleshooting
=========================

  Since the initial release of this document, a number of people have
  E-mailed me asking for help with a possibly virus-related problem.
  While I'll always help if I can, I should point out (1) I'm an
  experienced Mac user and an IT support professional, but I don't
  claim to be a Mac expert (2) pressure of work and other commitments
  and a huge E-mail turnover means that I can't promise a quick or
  in-depth response [DH]. Whether you mail direct or post to a
  relevant newsgroup, it's helpful if you can supply a few details,
  such as:

  * Which model of Macintosh you're using. It may be useful to know
    how much RAM it has, the size of the hard disk, and any peripherals
    you're using.
  * Which version of MacOS you're using.
  * Which applications you're using, and which version. If you're
    using Word, it may be critical to know whether you're using version
    6 or later, or an earlier version.
  * Which, if any, antivirus packages you use, and what version
    number. If you're using NAV, for instance, what version?
  * List any error messages or alerts that have appeared.
  * List any recent changes in configuration, additional hardware
    etc.
  * List any diagnostic/repair packages you've tried, and the
    results.
  * List any other steps you've taken towards determining the cause
    of the problem and/or trying to fix it, e.g. rebuilding the
    desktop, booting without extensions, zapping PRAM etc.

  Here are a few steps that it might be appropriate to try if virus
  scanning with an up-to-date scanner finds nothing. This section
  will be improved when and if I have time.

  Rebuilding the desktop is by no means a cure-all, but rarely does
  any harm. It may be worth disabling extensions when you do this,
  especially if the operation doesn't seem to be completed
  successfully.

  To disable extensions, restart the machine with the shift key held
  down until you see an Extensions Off message. If you're rebuilding
  the desktop, release the shift key and hold down Command (the key
  with the Apple outline icon) & Options (alt) until requested to
  confirm that you want to rebuild.

  Disabling extensions is also a good starting point for tracking
  down an extensions conflict. If booting without extensions appears
  to bypass the problem, try removing extensions with Extensions
  Manager (System 7.5) - remove one at a time, and replace it before
  removing the next one and booting with that one removed. Remember
  that if removing one stops the problem, it's still worth putting it
  back and trying all the others to see if you can find one it's
  conflicting with. Extensions Manager also lets you disable control
  panels. If you don't have Extensions Manager, try Now Utilities or
  Conflict Catcher.

  Parameter RAM (PRAM) contains system information, notably the
  settings for a number of system control panels. 'Zapping' PRAM
  returns possibly corrupt PRAM data to default values. A likely
  symptom of corrupted PRAM is a problem with date and time (but
  could be a symptom of a corrupted system file). With system 7, hold
  down Command-Option-P-R at bootup until the Mac beeps and restarts.
  You may have restore changes to some control panels before your
  system works properly. If the reset values aren't retained, the
  battery may need replacing.
