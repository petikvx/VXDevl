<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>A little bit of geography:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Romania, a small country by the Black Sea.
Between Bulgaria and Russia, two of the greatest virus scenes in Europe,
one might expect the same situation over here. Well, yes and no...
</p><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b></b></div>&nbsp;

<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b></b></div>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>In the ancient times:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Before 1989, when the Great Revolution replaced
the communist party with a democratic government, there were effectively
no Pcs, and no computer viruses. However, the Revolution changed everything
- many foreign companies started to invest in Romania, and they also brought
computers, as part of their business. That's why, only 1 year later, the
first Romanian virus was found - Jos.1000. This virus contained a "political"
message - when someone typed "jos" as part of a word, the virus's INT9
routine automatically inserted " Iliescu" which was the name of Romania's
President at that time. For those who wonder what "jos" means, the English
equivalent would be "down", so the complete message can be translated as
"Down with Iliescu". This virus also contained the following string:

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>"JABBERWOCKY (#), the first Romanian Political
Virussian"</i>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">That's why some AVs still detect this virus
as "Jabberwocky", or "Jabb.1000". At the same time, another virus appeared
- if Jos.1000 was only able to infect .COM files, the "new" Alexander.1843,
named from an encrypted string inside the virus, "Alexander - Constanta,
Romania", was also able to infect .EXE files. This virus contained code
similar to that found in Dark Avenger's "Eddie" viruses, for example the
memory residency routine. "Alexander" probably found the Eddie virus somewhere,
and wanted to code his own... While writing it, he also took some routines
from the Bulgarian virus, and added his own payload. Today, there are 3
versions of this virus: the "standard" 1843 bytes version, and other two
versions, 1951 and 2104 bytes long. As a side note, "Constanta" is a Romanian
city, probably the hometown of the author.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The next step was probably BadSectors.3428
- the first Romanian semi-stealth virus. It was the summer of 1992 when
I first saw it, and I spent about 5 hours to analyze it, and write a short
detector/cleaner. This virus was extremely infections, since it infected
files by hooking an impressive number of DOS functions. For example, it
was enough to perform a simple DIR command with the virus resident to infect
all the executable files in the current directory, or the directory targeted
by the DIR command. Combined with its limited stealth abilities, we can
explain why the number of victim computers was so high. The author of the
BadSectors virus also wrote other versions - while the 3428 version carried
the "BadSectors 1.2" string, 3 other versions, 3150, 3422 and 3626 bytes
are also known. (versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.3) They weren't however as successful
as the 3428 version...While BadSectors was in its golden days, other viruses
started to show up. Modified versions of "Mannequin.778" and "Jinx.846",
which weren't detected by any of the AV products used at that time, were
the first viral encounter for many unsuspecting users. This brings us to
the time when the first boot sector viruses are starting to be reported.
6 March 1992 was a day to remember for some of us, while the virus itself
got a very high attention in the media - warnings on the national TV channel
were broadcasted, and many companies have chosen not to use their computers
on that day to prevent the virus from activating. To make a parallel -
I must happily announce that there were no Michaelangelo reports this year
(1998) in Romania, and we don't consider it to be an issue anymore.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But let's get back to the old days: Michaelangelo
was soon followed by Parity_Boot.A,.B, Ripper and Stoned which were the
highspots of 1993, along with Hi.460 which was one of the most reported
viruses at that time. The "Mr" family, with it's impressive number of members
was also very common, but not a match for "Hi". Actually, Hi.460 was so
popular that about 4 or 5 other viruses based on it's code were found ItW
in 1993 and in the years to follow...

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The polymorphics:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1994 was the year when the first Romanian
polymorphic virus was discovered. Prodigy.1200, or UU.1200, as called by
some AV programs, used some simple polymorphism techniques to avoid detection
by conventional signatures. It was soon followed by Alia.1023, another
polymorphic virus, which was actively reported ItW at that time. Alia.1023
was also the first Romanian virus to include antiemulation/antiheuristics
code - the variable coprocessor instruction embedded in it's polymorphic
decryptor, which is not a problem for today's code emulators, proved to
be a very powerful defense. An 1300 bytes version is also known, but this
second version didn't had the same success as the 1023 bytes version, most
probably because of it's numerous bugs. While Prodigy and Alia were using
only simple polymorphism tricks, the much larger Dumb.4722, found at the
end of '95 was almost impossible to detect using signatures, wildcards
or cryptanalysis. It's name, suggested by the following string:

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>"I dunno what you think about me but i
am NOT dumb !"</i>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">was also used as a nickname by the author,
who gave an interview for a local IT newspaper a few months ago. In the
interview, he accused Romanian AV developer for making good money from
his work and said to have stopped writing viruses anymore. Dumb.4722 was
uploaded to several BBS systems (which were very popular in those days)
in a form of a dropper which claimed to be a graphic viewer utility.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The next Romanian polymorphic virus was Breath.3457
- this one's a little bit more complicated than Dumb.4722, and was strongly
promoted by its author via BBS using various shareware programs as droppers.
As anyone can see, spreading viruses via BBS was very common for most virus
writers.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Another romanian polymorphic virus is Calu.2429,
which also includes some anti-emulation code and tricks. It was found at
the middle of '96, and so far it's the last Romanian polymorphic virus
- there are some (uncomfirmed) reports of a new advanced polymorphic virus
floating around, but it might be just a story, so let's hope the number
of romanian polymorhpic viruses will remain unchanged for a long time...

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Romanian ItW viruses:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Many viruses are constantly found ItW, including
the Leonard.1194 and .1176 which are quite common right now. OneHalf.3544.a
is still one of the most widespread viruses - I usually get infected (or
damaged) hard-disks each month. A few months ago, we had reports of infections
with the 3544.g strain, which is not very different from the base version,
but not as many as those of OneHalf.3544.a... Unsnared.814 (VB November
'96) was also one of the most reported viruses only a few time ago, but
now it's not a problem anymore, with so many AVs able to detect and clean
it. Other common viruses are Burglar.1150.A, DS.3783 (see VB March '97),
Pieck.4444 and the recent Romanian viruses Teapa.1609, Scapny.795 and Equinox.855.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are few AV researchers who know that
Romania is probably the only country which has a local WildList - the RoWildList.
The RoWildList was started in the summer of '96 by Gabriel Pislaru, a member
of the international WildList. At the beginning of '97, Gabi forwarded
the RoWildList's maintenance to a fellow researcher, and the list is still
active, showing the evolution of the viral activity in Romania. You can
download some of the RoWL issues from

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="ftp://ftp.gecad.ro/pub/RoWildList/">ftp://ftp.gecad.ro/pub/RoWildList/</a>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For example, the RoWildList was used as test-base
in a recent AV comparative review supported by the Romanian PC-REPORT publication.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So far we only mentioned file viruses - however,
you should be surprised to hear that today's leaders are not COM, EXE or
Macro viruses as one might think, but boot viruses. "R.P.", a prodigious
Romanian virus author, wrote about 20 boot viruses, the so-called "RP."
family, including RP.Dec_17th which is constantly reported (or more precisely,
it's payload) every year. "R.P." also wrote the so-called "Dodgy" boot
virus, the first Romanian boot virus able to correctly replicate from Windows95
using the same method as the "Hare" viruses to intercept floppy accesses.
With over 4 subversions, "Dodgy" is still reported in Romania, and word-wide.
"Dodgy" is also one the few Romanian retro viruses, as it contains specific
activation routines related to my AV program, RAV. The payload from "Dodgy",
which is pretty effective, still brings 3 or 4 damaged disks each month
to our data-recovery division.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Recentely, a very unfortunate event helped
it to reach more victims - one local IT publication distributed a Dodgy
dropper on one of it's CDs, as a program called "RENEDEMO". They however
published an excuse in the next issue, and indications on how to manually
remove the virus from infected systems. This was probably their second
mistake, as most of their readers don't have the required computer skills
to correctly accomplish (or understand) the removal instructions. The fact
that the CD containing the dropper was scanned with a well-known (not Romanian)
AV package, also used as an "excuse" is not making the things better for
users (who might have lost their trust in that AV program) or the editors
of that publication, which eventually stopped including free software sent
by readers on their CD's.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The virus writer "R.P." also wrote the "RP.Bugs",
"RP.Remember" and "RP.New_Gen" viruses, which were also reported ItW. They
were not as successful as "Dodgy", thought.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Another common boot virus over here is "Multi_Ani",
also suspected to be of Romanian origin ("Multi_Ani" is the Romanian translation
for "Happy New Year") Computers infected by both Multi_Ani and some RP
variant are also very common. So far, we have no reports of Win32 viruses,
or viruses able to infect PE files, such as the "Win95.Anxiety" family
which is known to be ItW in Russia or the Czech Republic.

<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b></b></div>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Macro viruses:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The macro virus issue begun back in the winter
of '95, when an IT publication printed the source for Concept - this quickly
produced 5 or 6 versions, depending on the number of tabs or spaces used
by the person who typed in the source. After 4 years, we still get reports
of Concept infections, but not as many as 2 years ago. Nowadays, NPad and
CAP are leading the field, but the number of Excel97 reports (XM97/Laroux
versions mostly) is also showing a small increase... So far, no macro virus
has been written in Romania, but we expect one to show up at any moment.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Laws and the future:</b>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The virus scene can now be described as "calm",
compared to the situation 2 or 3 years ago. The boot viruses are still
a problem, and macro viruses (especially Office97 macro viruses) are showing
a notable increase in the past few months. In Romania there are 3 major
AV developers, and therefore 3 different antivirus programs, namely RAV
- developed by GeCAD, the company I work for, AVX developed by SoftWin
and SUMI Software's AspVirin. (more informations and shareware versions
can be obtained from <a href="http://www.gecad.ro/">http://www.gecad.ro/</a>
for RAV, <a href="http://www.softwin.ro/">http://www.softwin.ro/</a> for
AVX and <a href="http://www.sumi.ro/">http://www.sumi.ro/</a> for AspVirin)
Other foreign products are also available for users, but they don't have
the same success as the above 3 mentioned programs - this is understandable,
since for example, RAV has a 6-years old market. The laws are unfortunately
the main problem when it comes to virus writing in Romania. Actually, there
are no laws that can be used against virus authors, and the copyright law
is only a few months old. Worse, there are even virus-writing discussion
lists, such as virus-l @pcnet.ro which is a common place for meeting virus
authors, such as the person going under the nickname of "Lord Julus", which
is also the author of a recently polymorphism-oriented article in the virus
e-zine "29A#2". His polymorphic engine, called "Lord's Multiple Opcode
Fantasies" and mentioned in that article, is probably just a story as I
haven't seen any virus based on it, at least yet. The author of the "R.P."
viruses is for example known, as he signed his sources with his real name,
and then distributed them among some of his "friends". The sources eventually
ended in various BBS boards, and some of our users have sent them to us
for "analysis". As incredible as it might sound, "R.P." came to visit our
stand at several computer fairs, and each time brought some of his new
creations to prove that his viruses can't be detected by any known AV software
! However, there's really nothing we can do about this problem, as I said
before, there are no laws against virus writing and distribution. Since
most virus authors are using pirated AV software to make their creations
undetectable, heuristics are probably the only defense we have against
them.

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As for the future, I expect a decrease in
the number of boot infection reports, along with a small decrease in the
number of macro viruses reports as an effect of the more advanced macro
virus detection engines used in today's AV software. If nothing new shows
up (like a new kind of virus, or a new highly insecure virus platform from
large software vendors) the situation should be easy to keep under control
for many years from now on.
