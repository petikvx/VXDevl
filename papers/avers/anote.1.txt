      This report is provided to satisfy the curiosity of the
      public. We were approached by some third parties to perform an
      analysis on MtE. We would like to share the results of our
      analysis with everyone. If you find an error or inaccuracy in
      this report, please feel free to contact us. All constructive
      criticism is welcome.

                  I. Mutation Engine and Viruses

      We have analyzed the so-called MtE (Mutation Engine by a "Dark
Avenger" from Bulgaria), and sample viruses based on it; namely,
Pogue and Dedicated. We have also conducted tests to examine what
kind of a potential this miscreant has, and collected empirical
data on how popular scanners deal with the MtE. We have also implemented a
little program (CatchMTE) that can recognize MtE-based code using an
algorithmic technique. The program in executable form is available free of
charge as a service to the public. Due to possible misuse, the source code
and a more detailed (at the opcode and bit-mask level) analysis with
decryptor samples and algorithms necessary to detect MtE will be made
available in a limited fashion. Under no circumstances, actual virus
samples will be provided; except the missed samples can be sent to known
anti-viral product developers who wish to enhance their programs.

      For those who are not familiar with the MtE, some preliminary
info will be presented first:

      MtE is NOT a virus per se, but an object module that can be
linked into a virus to give it polymorphic capabilities. MtE
expects to be called as a routine that can encrypt a certain
portion of code and can generate a suitable decryption routine. It
uses a random number generator to vary each mutation so that it
will not be possible to recognize the new variant by using simple
scanning techniques. The random number generator is not part of the
MtE object module. A sample pseudo-random number generator is
included with the archive Dark Avenger distributes. A virus writer
could also supply his own random number generator.
