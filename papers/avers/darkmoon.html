<h2>Dark Side of the Moon: What Motivates Virus Writers</h2>

Many of us may have wondered what motivates some people to 
create viruses. At first glance, the act seems completely 
irrational: there is no money to be gained, and virus writers 
run the risk of being held liable for the destruction caused by 
their pets.
 
Virus writers have their reasons, of course. Few people do 
anything without a good reason, even less so these sometimes 
highly intelligent programmers. A good reason need not be a 
rational one, however. It need not even be conscious. We all do 
some things just because - let's face it - we feel like it.
Revenge and misantrophism aside, why do some of us feel like 
churning out malicious programs?
 
In the Interests of Research
----------------------------
Some people, particularly the top-class virus writers, maintain 
that their interest in viruses is purely scientific. They wish 
to find out everything there is to know about viruses and their 
uses. Well and good. The question is, why have they picked 
viruses as the search subject?
 
Limited Forums
--------------
For somebody interested in programming per se, but without a 
formal degree and/or inclination to direct his or her talents 
into some specific field, the world offers lean pickings. 
Software companies are relatively insular organizations which 
have trade secrets to protect. Theoretical research into 
computing usually requires an university degree and a post in 
some research team. What's left?
 
Virus groups are virtually the only organized programming forums 
open to anybody interested. They offer support, programming 
tips, camaraderie and few limitations. Group members can count 
on advice from other members, and they are free to pursue any 
subject that catches their fancy. Since the groups are more or 
less hobby organizations, members need not fear that somebody 
will cut off their funding or publishing avenues.
 
Army of Darkness
----------------
Why must such groups be especially virus groups? We haven't seen 
much in the way of games, utility programs or word processor 
groups. Even if such groups have been formed, they haven't 
survived, whereas virus groups have. Virus groups have drive.
Virus writing is in itself a powerful cohesive force. It places 
the programmer outside conventional rules of acceptable 
behavior. In return for relinquishing a place in ordered 
society, a virus writer gains the membership of a shadow 
society, a virus group. That the transition is largely imaginary 
is not important. It's the image that counts.
 
The image must, of course, be upheld. Look at all the 
paraphernalia associated with virus groups and writers. Handles 
with Dark this and Dark that. Fire and brimstone. Heavy metal 
citations. Weird bits.
 
The more sophisticated virus writers will no doubt argue that 
such things are pure self-irony. After all, no one could take 
such adolescent foolishness seriously. Indeed? The one thing 
that tends to characterize virus publications is a dreadful lack 
of humor. Most of these guys are dead set on their chosen roles. 
Got you, lamer! Ha-ha.
 
It must be noted, though, that most secretive societies display 
similar characteristics. The idea of freemasonry does not strike 
me as particularly mature, either.
 
Legalize Pot!
-------------
Somewhat out of keeping with their secret-society image, virus 
groups are trying to gain legitimacy for their activities. This 
can be partly seen as a response to toughening legislation. 
These groups definitely do not want to be shut down by 
governmental agencies. Official harassment might scare away 
prospective members, too.
 
The groups have been cleaning up their act by limiting public 
access to the viruses, polymorphic generators etc. they create. 
Moreover, many group members almost routinely equip their 
creations with notes which forbid them to be used for 
destructive purposes. This, they feel, gives them moral 
superiority. Legislative anti-virus measures must be seen as 
censorship. Freedom of expression must be protected at any cost.
These claims may well have certain validity. However, as long as 
the groups keep turning out software which is either potentially 
or actually harmful, such arguments are either outright 
hypocritical or at least morally one-sided.
 
More interesting, though, is what legitimacy would mean to the 
groups themselves. Virus groups exist to create and distribute 
viruses and other malicious software. If they stop doing that, 
or are brought under official control, they lose their reason 
for existence. A legitimate, official virus group would have 
very little cohesive force. Who would wish to join?
Do these guys know what they are doing to themselves?
 
Get the Lamers!
---------------
There are some talented virus writers outside the established 
virus groups. It is often among them that the most widely spread 
and destructive viruses originate.
 
These people are not in viruses for anything like research. They 
are out to catch lamers. In this context, a lamer is anybody who 
hasn't protected his or her system well enough. And why should 
lamers be caught? Well...why rip wings off a fly...stomp 
faggots...climb a mountain (because it's there, and you can).
 
Off the Beaten Path
-------------------
These people seem to want two things: thrills and reputation. 
They are not necessarily nerds, as has often been conjectured, 
but they are obviously not satisfied with their occupation 
and/or social life. Most of them also seem to be adolescent and 
male.
 
It is from this group that terrorists most often recruit, also.
Make no mistake: this kind of virus writers can often be very 
intelligent. They do not create destructive viruses because they 
lack appreciation of the consequences, but to satisfy emotional 
needs. The viruses themselves do not really matter. They are 
just a vehicle for negative self-expression. A means to 
establish a place in the world. Something to brag about (or 
something to drop hints of: Data Fellows has received letters in 
which virus writers deliberately gave clues about their 
identity).
 
Fortunately, few of these virus writers persist long in the 
adolescent stage. Usually they either get seriously interested 
in viruses and join an established virus group, or find 
something more profitable to occupy their time.
 
Romancing the Code
------------------
Finally, there are people who do not necessarily know the first 
thing about assembly language or virus programming. They are 
into viruses because it's cool. Viruses, polymorphic generators 
and trojan horses have a certain somber lustre about them. Who 
knows, maybe some of it will rub off if one hangs around them 
long enough.
 
...Just Add Some Water...
-------------------------
This is the target group for virus creation kits, polymorphic 
generators, documented source code and other goodies that virus 
groups keep churning out. It does not take very much programming 
experience to operate a menu-based virus generator, for example. 
This kind of virus writers tend to be more interested in 
claiming the title than in actually writing viruses. However, 
after practicing long enough some of them do graduate into more 
rarefied spheres.
 
For this kind of writers, the most fundamental reasons for 
creating viruses may be the sense of belonging, and of 
accomplishment. Viruses have also an attractive, outlaw air 
about them. So does scrawling tags on buildings, for that 
matter. However, the additional sense of intellectual 
accomplishment may well give viruses an edge over graffiti.
 
Stamp Collectors
----------------
Some people collect viruses like others do stamps or coins. They 
are not usually particularly interested in using these viruses 
for anything. They do not necessarily even understand how their 
collection items work. Well, how many collectors do?
But hey, it's great to have a big collection! 
 
Benefits of Virus Writing
-------------------------
Virus writers often rationalize their work. Some arguments claim 
that certain viruses can be beneficial, some defend the freedom 
of expression, still others emphasize new programming techniques 
to be learned...what nonsense. Viruses, be they of the computer 
persuasion or otherwise, are basically parasites. About the only 
thing to be learned from them is how to make better parasites. 
Useless creatures, really, unless you are working for the 
military...which is a thing that should not be forgotten, 
either.
 
However, computer viruses have had one beneficial side effect: 
they have made people more security conscious. Viruses are a 
highly visible threat, but by no means the only one. If the 
virus threat persuades users and administrators to improve the 
security of their systems, there may be some justification for 
the existence of viruses after all. Sort of.
