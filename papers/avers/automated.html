<P>1. Introduction</P>
<BR>

A recent look at some Anti Virus (AV) products found that the
state-of-the-art in virus response has moved forward, but only
slightly toward what we need in an enterprise environment. One
product will auto-disinfect floppy disk boot sectors on
presentation without user intervention. Another product will auto-
recover from BS/MBR virus infections but still requires operator
intervention. There is also a product that will install on
infected systems and clean the system during the installation.
There is a product that has been capturing virus specimens for
years. Many products will notify someone over a network; but
incident accounting seems to be missing altogether.<P>

The reason for the slow progress may be because there is no vision
of what kind of product we should be moving toward; or maybe the
AV development community is just more resistant to change than
other development communities. We can do something about the
former, that is, tell the AV development community what we want.
This paper is just that, the "Enterprise Wish-list for AV product
developers". I hope that there will be other papers that will
correct my errors or include my omissions when and if they are
identified. Such work is good and will fulfill the need for
visionary direction that we need so desperately.<P>

Generally speaking we are still working with the philosophy of
non-automated response to virus exposure and infection response.
Basically it's "product sees it, someone cleans it". This is fine
for the single user at home, but not much good for an enterprise
environment. What we need is a Fully Automated Response (FAR) for
virus exposures and infections produced by the viruses from which
we are most at risk, the In The Wild (ITW) virus. I would like to
see an automated response with no user intervention and automatic
sample gathering and reporting for ITW virus infections and
exposures. I think this is extremely important in our environments
that are directly exposed to the same in-the-wild viruses on a
daily basis.<P>

FAR is a response philosophy for the known risk; it is not a
substitute for unknown risk mitigation. FAR handles the 99% you
know, not the 1% risk you have yet to experience. Once
experienced, the unknown risk becomes the known risk and is
included in the known risk handling (FAR).<P>


2. Specifications and Definitions<P>

The target audience is the Corporate Security Manager or the
Network Administrator responsible for Anti-Virus capabilities.
This is not meant to be a feasibility study, a technical
justification, or a technical description of implementation. This
is intended to present the idea of FAR to the target audience,
highlight a few problems that will surface, and describe what FAR
might look like from the functional point of view.<P>

This paper is concerned with only a subset of all known DOS
viruses; that subset is the "in-the-wild" (ITW) viruses. There is
no provision for MAC viruses or viruses not found in the wild. The
reader is charged to keep this in mind throughout the paper
because what is stated here and applies here applies to "in-the-
wild DOS viruses" only. What I am asserting may not be applicable
in the theoretical realm that includes response for all known and
future viruses, and it isn't meant to be.<P>

In-the-wild viruses are those viruses that are actually cruising
computers in homes and organizations. These are the viruses that
are likely to visit your organization (99% or more of the time).
There are zoos containing thousands of viruses. These zoos are
passed around to professionals, non-professionals, and the
curious. Just because a virus is in a zoo, it does not mean that
you are likely to see it in your organization. "Zoo specimens"
should not be confused with "in the wild" viruses. I will refer to
the "in the wild" as ITW.<P>

The current document which attempts to identify ITW viruses and
appears to be accepted by all is Joe Wells' Wildlist. It is a good
starting place, but one should keep in mind that there are viruses
in the wild that are not on Joe's Wildlist and that there are a
few problems with the list itself. For instance, because of naming
variations the same virus appears more than once and since there
is not a repository for actual ITW samples, some of the listed
viruses are too vague to point to a specific strain. I think using
this list is the most acceptable place to start and that the list
will overcome it's current problems as it is used more.<P>

I use the term "virus exposure" as the general definition of a
clean system in which a virus is present. Examples of this are: 1)
a clean system that has an infected floppy disk in the drive; and,
2) a clean system that has an object (file infector) with a virus
in it that if executed, can infect the system.<P>

I use the term "virus infection" as the general definition of a
system that has a memory resident virus active and capable of
reproducing (non-resident viruses not included).<P>

I use the terms "enterprise", "organization", and "site" to
indicate a networked system with multiple DOS computers connected
to it. This could be a small company, a school or university, or a
multi-national corporation.<P>

FAR is Fully Automated Response. This is an automated
identification, disinfection, and reporting response to those
viruses for which it is most appropriate. No user intervention is
required and no user notification is delivered. Most BS/MBR,
multipartite, and file viruses can be dealt with by restoring
infected objects, even with the virus present. Some viruses cannot
or should not be included in an automated response; these viruses
are termed non-FAR viruses. Non-FAR viruses include those that
destroy the executable or that require the virus to be present to
access data.<P>

A FAR-ITW virus is an "in the wild" virus that can be disinfected
without a special disinfection procedure (ie. can be totally
contained in a software solution). All ITW boot sector (BS),
master boot record (MBR), companion, directory, appending, and
prepending viruses that do not produce "virus resident dependent"
problems should be included in a fully automated restoration
capability. Exceptional ITW viruses requiring special disinfection
procedures need not be included in the FAR requirement and are
noted as non-FAR-ITW viruses. Exebug would be a FAR-ITW virus,
One-half may be a non-FAR-ITW virus (depends on the expertise of
the AV developer). Some hardware implementations may dictate some
virus infections as non-FAR.<P>

A virus zoo is a large collection of files that (hopefully)
contains a large variety of viruses. It is hoped that this
collection of viruses is somewhat representative of all of the
viruses available, so therefore it is acceptable for testing. At
least 95% of these viruses are not "in the wild". The virus zoo is
typically used to "measure" the performance of virus scanners
(scanners scan files in a clean environment). Many virus zoos are
not complete (whole families missing), cleaned (only containing
viruses), or maintained (contains junk, joke, or simulator files).
Yet this is the current mechanism that is used to test virus
scanners (it is the easiest to do). No one claims to have "all the
viruses" so every virus zoo is incomplete. These zoos are used to
"impress the non-technical person". This is also the current
method of "certifying" virus products and the zoo is often kept
secret and/or questioned by those that are proficient in the AV
industry. This sort of  zoo testing is of limited value to those
not thoroughly understanding the state of virus distribution. It
is normally taken "as gospel" by consumers and trumpeted by
marketers. It is of very limited (and zoo-dependent) value for
consumers in determining the suitability of a product's
performance in an organization's virus environment. Just because a
scanner finds a research virus in a private zoo does not mean that
the same scanner will perform adequately with an in-the-wild virus
in your organization.<P>

A "workplace interruption" is any unnecessary interruption of
user's productivity. This includes manually cleaning floppy disks,
scanning systems, cleaning systems, etc. A workplace interruption
is not limited to a single worker; it often extends to other
workers nearby. Workplace interruptions can be short or extended.
The organization loses productivity with each incident that
interrupts the worker. This productivity loss is often much more
expensive than the actual cost of the technical response to the
incident. In larger organizations with employees located across
large geographical areas without onsite technical support, virus
incident handling can require direct user assistance, increasing
the magnitude of the interruption. An interruption need only occur
when the ITW virus infection is non-FAR.<P>

No specific network is required for this model, communication
requirements are stated generically. The specific implementation
will vary from network to network, feature to feature.<P>

"NLMs" and FAR have almost nothing to do with one another. File
and multipartite infections may reside on servers, but it is
workstations that "get infected" and "spread infections". The
conventional NLM should not be confused with a fully automated
response; scanning executables delivered from a server is just
part of the job. You may need an NLM if you don't have any decent
network security (ie. someone using the network can infect an
object residing on the network), but FAR is a different
philosophy.<P>


3. What we are doing now<P>

The conventional wisdom until now has been that the user must be
informed of any virus exposure or infection immediately and then
be required to deal with it. This required that the user be
trained sufficiently in virus matters to make the necessary
decisions or must call for technical help. The user base, type of
work accomplished, and the way in which people use computers today
has changed drastically, but our conventional wisdom has remained
the same. I believe that this adversely affects the organization
in terms of  cost and productivity.<P>

Organizations handle BS virus exposures and BS/MBR infections in
different manners. Some consider an exposure severe enough to stop
work and require the response of specialists to take care of the
virus. Others may only require this for infections and expect the
user to use an AV product to neutralize the BS virus exposure.<P>

File viruses present a more significant threat in that files can
be executed. Some organizations may halt all work on the computer
if an infected file is about to be executed. Others simply deny
execution of the infected file. Few organizations expect users to
deal with the complete file virus exposure or infection. This
requires technical support help that can interrupt a user for as
much as half of a day.<P>

The common thread is that the effect on the organization is a work
interruption, immediate new tasking for the user (virus cleanup),
or often work is discontinued while more resources are expended to
dispatch a technician to take care of the problem. Until the
situation is resolved, be it 30 minutes or a day, the lost
productivity costs the organization; and in some cases, this cost
is substantial.<P>

Consider a presentation that needs to be modified for an important
meeting. The presentation is needed in 20 minutes so it is
transported by floppy disk instead of Email to a person located
close to the meeting. The disk is infected with a BS/MBR virus.
The person that will make the changes inserts the disk and is
informed to call the help desk because of the BS virus. The person
explains the urgency so the help desk dispatches a technician from
a job in the local area of the person and arrives in 15 minutes.
The technician follows the prescribed procedures and completes the
disinfection in 10 minutes. The cost is the help desk response,
approximately 30 minutes each for the person and technician, and
the interrupted work is 30 minutes behind.<P>

The presentation is not modified and delivered in time. The new
information not included in the presentation would have clinched a
large client deal. If the same scenario is played with a FAR
product, the user would not have been interrupted and the virus
administrator would have all of the information necessary to
perform any follow-up necessary.<P>

Conventional wisdom must advance to keep up with the user
population, the manner in which the computer is used, and computer
technical expertise. A user is now just that, a user. Users expect
the organization to provide them with the tools to do their job,
tools that do their level best to contribute to the user's
efficiency. Conventional wisdom should now be to ensure
productivity, maintain the integrity of the computing environment,
and let the organization determine how and when the virus impinges
on the work environment. It is time to let the user work and let
the virus administrator determine in what manner, when, and how
intrusive the presence of a virus is. When implemented
intelligently, the organization can minimize the workplace
interruption and more effectively handle the virus problem.<P>

Corporations, companies, and workers must "get lean" and be more
productive. AV software response to virus exposures and infections
is no exception. Virus response is overhead; that response can be
fully automated. The "fat" AV product that requires human guidance
is a "high maintenance" product we can no longer afford in our
fast-paced work environments.<P>


4. In The Wild viruses<P>

So just how many of the thousands of viruses are we talking about?
It is not near what you think! Joe Wells' list of July 1, 1994
lists a total of 152. January 1, 1995 shows a total of 197. The
current list of June 1, 1995 gives us a total of 235 worldwide! I
know that there are more ITW viruses than on Joe's list. It is the
requirement of list participation that causes this problem. Even
if we add 30% to Joe's list we still only reach just over 300
viruses!<P>

Of the 6,000 or more viruses in existence, it is most probably a
mere 300 that we are talking about for FAR!  This is just 5% of
the world's virus population.<P>
 
Let's say that 35% of the ITW is BS/MBR viruses. A conservative
figure is 65% of the virus incidents in an organization are ITW
BS/MBR viruses. This means that more than 65% of the problem is
caused by a mere one and one quarter percent (1.25%) of the
viruses! In many organizations BS/MBR infections account for 90+%
of the number of virus incidents.<P>

When we look at the viruses that we see everyday, they are
virtually all ITW viruses.<P>


5. The Fully Automated Response (FAR) overview<P>

Fully Automated Response is:<P>

A. Detect the ITW virus<BR>
B. Remove the ITW virus automatically and without any user
notification or intervention<BR>
C. Report the incident to technical support (a virus
administrator)<P>

The difference between current solutions and FAR is that software
does all the work automatically and quietly. No intervention of
any kind is required. We make all the decisions up front.<P>

     Decision 1 - always remove the ITW virus.<P>

     Decision 2 - always report incidents and include a sample of
     the virus.<P>

     Decision 3 - always compile statistics<P>

The event, as an exposure or an infection, must be closed by the
conclusion of the response. After-action decisions, such as
notification, are handled outside of the response. It is this
"total response to the event" that we currently lack. We augment
our current responses with customer service manpower, technical
support manpower, user manpower, and training manpower. All of
this manpower is a waste of our organization's resources. We've
just got to do things smarter!<P>

FAR should be considered a "medium security" solution. (Those
needing a "high security" solution must add appropriate
technology.)<P>

Note that FAR lacks the "tell the user and make a big deal of it"
philosophy. When asked, I have found users say that the last thing
they want to deal with is a virus. "I just want to do my work" is
the most common phrase I hear when talking to enterprise users. I
agree with the user; let them work. Let virus administrators
notify users, follow-up, and disseminate training when necessary.<P>

For those concerned with "user interfaces", what better user
interface could there be than FAR!?! Absolutely no user input is
required. In non-FAR situations, user response is via a message
directing the user to call the Help Desk (or whatever is desired).
Administrator interface (to the FAR product administration) is a
different issue, and keep in mind that system administrators
generally are more computer literate than most end users.<P>

The reasons we need FAR are:<P>

1.   it costs too much to "open a ticket and dispatch a tech" for
     individual virus incidents<P>
2.   the resulting (and expensive) workplace interruption is not
     necessary and is too costly<P>
3.   we can cut down the necessary virus training for technicians
     and employees<P>
4.   we need automated reporting so we can justify re-licensing
     the product next year.<P>

If your virus problem consists solely of infections by FAR-ITW
viruses, then it is easy to calculate the cost savings. Just add
all of the costs of the Help Desk calls plus the PC technician's
time plus the lost worker productivity. This is the amount you
would save with FAR for ITW viruses.<P>
 
FAR need only handle our biggest risk, the ITW virus. There is no
need to include every obscure research virus in the FAR concept.
New ITW viruses will appear and need to be included in the FAR.
Most products have demonstrated that they can supply scanners and
cleaners for new ITW viruses very quickly (sometimes in mere
hours) so including them in FAR products is trivial.<P>

The idea behind FAR is to use an automated response to a FAR-ITW
virus infection or exposure whenever possible. This includes
product installation. There are no technical reasons for why a
FAR-ITW virus cannot be dealt with when installing a FAR product
on an infected system. If generic solutions such as a generic MBR
restoration instead of a real MBR restoration are necessary, these
are acceptable.<P>

"False Positives" are non-existent in the FAR model. Since we are
talking about working with known viruses, both memory and object
infections can be positively identified.<P>

 FAR is not a replacement for all current AV products. FAR is the
distillation of the best technologies into the exact product that
will be of the most value fighting viruses on the front lines.
FAR's technology comes from the multitude of other products, all
FAR necessary technology is already in existence in different
products. Research and Development of current products must
continue. There is no reason for FAR to be the only technology an
organization utilizes. All organizations must select the
technology that best fulfills their security philosophy.<P>


FAR is comprised of six tasks:<P>

1. Identify the ITW virus<BR>
2. collect a sample<BR>
3. clean the ITW virus<BR>
4. make a report<BR>
5. send report to virus administrator<BR>
6. keep all incident statistics for the virus administrator<P>

and must operate equally well in:<P>

1. the clean environment<BR>
2. the infected environment<P>

Under clean conditions, FAR requires that the virus be cleaned
without user notification or intervention. Notification of the
exposure should be a virus sample and report to the virus
administrator. Leave user notification to the virus administrator.
Installation should be automatic, no user intervention required,
and should save the MBR, BS, system files, and command processor
(depending on product design philosophy). These objects can be
used later in infection recovery instances.<P>

Under FAR-ITW infected conditions, FAR requires that the virus be
handled exactly as under clean conditions (ie. identify, remove,
report). Installation should recover the system and save the same
objects as under clean installation.<P>

Under non-FAR-ITW infected conditions, FAR requires that the user
be notified to contact their local technical support personnel.
Under these conditions, the situation is hazardous enough to
warrant workplace interruption. All of the sample gathering and
reporting should be done, but in the non-FAR-ITW infected
condition the virus is not automatically cleaned.<P>

All of the techniques necessary to accomplish the related tasks
necessary for FAR have been used in one product or another at some
time. I note that some products really excel in some of these
areas. What we have never seen is those techniques combined to
accomplish FAR. It's not that FAR is impossible; it just hasn't
been a priority worth pursuing...yet. If the "best
identification", the best "working in an infected environment",
and the"best restoration" were all to join together with the "best
accounting" we could have a superior FAR product!<P>


6. Problems We Face to implement FAR-ITW<P>

We face four basic problems to implement FAR-ITW:<P>

1. No ITW base from which to start from<BR>
2. Current "zoo" certifications<BR>
3. Industry resistance<BR>
4. Ourselves<P>

A. No ITW base<P>

Unfortunately while Joe's Wildlist is a starting place, it is not
a base to define the ITW. There is no actual "ITW zoo" from which
to specify that "these are the ITW viruses". The only public ITW
attempt is currently made by Virus Bulletin and it does not
resemble Joe's list to any great degree. I have 90% of the ITW
viruses on Joe's list and it is easy to argue that they are not
the actual ITW viruses that are reported on the list. This is due
to the variety of names and inexact identification by some
products. Still it is from this list that we can at least start an
interim solution.<P>

We need two solutions for this problem.<P>

The first is an interim solution that will establish a consensus
of what AV developers and professionals will concede makes a
reasonable ITW zoo. This work is in progress by Richard Ford at
NCSA. Richard is working with the Anti Virus Product Developer
group to define an initial ITW specification. The agreed upon
samples will form the first ITW sample base.<P>

The second, long term solution is to "start from scratch". We must
assemble a "new" ITW list directly supported by an ITW sample
base. These samples would be from actual ITW infections. This
would provide the indisputable base from which to launch a
definite FAR-ITW implementation. Information compiled must include
generic site information and specific virus information for each
infection and exposure reported.  This will give us more
information than ever, including virus location and prevalence.
All incidents need to be reported to get an accurate picture of
the true ITW virus.<P>

We, as corporations, organizations, sites, and private users must
assist in the assembly of this new base by reporting ITW
infections and exposures, complete with samples. The new ITW
sample base will identify a real sample of the actual ITW threat
to computer systems that all can agree on. This must be a world-
wide effort. I am confident that the AV developer, professional,
independent, and the user communities will support such an effort.<P>

To facilitate such a massive effort requires central clearing
houses from which to assemble reports and samples to define the
actual ITW virus. Existing and new reporting lines will be able to
support and represent all of us. Joe Wells has a reporting
structure in place and will collect samples. Virus Bulletin has
been reporting ITW infections and can collect samples. NCSA has a
large membership and as a security organization seems to be the
most likely place to house the ITW sample base. All ITW samples
must be made available to all AV developers (a situation that does
not now exist). Other professionals and Independents in
organizations can help by forwarding reports and samples to
another central location. This could be the first joint venture
for all to unite to solve our biggest single problem.<P>

The actual details of creating a working solution from which we
may all come together is in the making. It looks like there will
be 3 or 4 different places to report infections and exposures and
send samples. More details will be forthcoming.<P>


B. Zoo Certifications<P>

While there have been no ITW sample bases to test products with,
there are a lot of "virus zoos" out there. Using these zoos to
"test scanners" has been the definition of AV product testing.
"Zoo scanning" requires a known control base and proper
interpretation of results, two things in short supply. What has
taken the place of representing our actual threat has been this
"zoo testing". The  scanner is pitted against one or many private
collections of a myriad of viruses, Trojans, joke programs,
simulator samples, and just plain junk files. We are "given
results" and told that this certifies some product as good for use
in our ITW environments. Few things are further from the truth.<P>

Zoo certifications are really a sort of "what if the research
virus made it to the wild?". Occasionally this happens, but
frequently the new ITW virus is new, so "zoo scanning" doesn't
help. Proper interpretation of this sort of "scanner testing" may
be valuable but just isn't directly transferable to solutions to
our ITW problems. Worse still is that these certifications give
one a false sense of security because they are a very inadequate
test. Just because a scanner can identify something in a zoo
scanning test does not mean that it will find the virus in an
infected environment (this is a common occurrence).<P>

We must de-emphasize "zoo certifications" and emphasize "ITW
certifications" using a known ITW sample base. Casual magazine-
type "AV testing" without professional guidance must be avoided.<P>


C. Industry resistance<P>

The AV development industry has just emerged from a war with the
virus creation community. The virus creation community provided,
the AV development community included, regardless. This has little
to do with our ITW problems except that some AV developers got so
caught up in the war, they forgot the civilians. Fact is, until
recently when ITW virus testing became something that could not be
ignored, it was ignored by most. There has never been a concerted
effort by the AV community to deal with ITW viruses. AV developers
must engage in "full disclosure" of ITW viruses. Current exchange
restrictions should only apply to research viruses. It will take
time to change current systems and philosophies.<P>

The AV industry is sometimes inflexible in int's response to our
requirements because it is inclined toward what the AV industry
thinks we need. Consumers bear a fair amount of the blame for
picking products that identified ever increasing numbers of
viruses (zoo certifications) and insisting on a scanner solution.
We have refused to listen to sage advice concerning different
levels of security solutions, insisting that there should be just
one - the scanner.<P>

The AV industry is geared to our marketing weaknesses and will
resist the direction in which we really need to go. We must change
and specify our requirements to reflect our real needs if we wish
to motivate the AV industry to provide real solutions.<P>

D. Ourselves<P>

We as a consumer community must look at the information we see and
make some intelligent, objective analysis. We have to learn the
difference between an article and an advertisement. We are
considered by the marketing community to be drones waiting to be
told what to do. Don't blame anyone else; it is our fault. We are
much more educated in other areas of purchase and naive in AV
product selection.<P>

We need to get reliable information from security organizations
rather than advertisements. We need to support activities that are
directed at ITW viruses and the reliable, appropriate handling of
them. If your security organization does not have sound,
measurable efforts in these areas, you need to demand them.<P>


7. FAR in Operation<P>

To be complete, I must describe FAR well enough to facilitate it's
development. Some managers may not be concerned with the
specifics. Skip this section if you wish.<P>

A. The infected floppy virus exposure<P>

This is the easiest response to implement. The object in question
is not executed and needs to be replaced with a known object.<P>

FAR says that when a user inserts an infected floppy disk in the
system that the following happens:<P>

1.        identify the ITW virus<BR>
2.        save a sample of the BS<BR>
3.        clean the floppy if not write protected<BR>
4.        create an infection report<BR>
5.        send the report and sample to the virus administrator
          when possible<BR>
6.        integrate the infection report into the virus
          administrator's summary<BR>

Several things happen in this instance:<P>

1.        the user continues working with a clean floppy that will
          not later infect a computer<BR>
2.        the administrator knows what the user is exposed to
          before the organization gets infected by it<BR>
3.        virus incident statistics are automatically compiled<P>

I do not consider the failure to restore a BS on a write protected
disk sufficient reason to interrupt the user. This disinfection
failure should be forwarded to the virus administrator and the
appropriate decisions made by the administrator.<P>

What's left to do? The virus administrator needs to determine how
and when the user is notified of the problem that could have
disrupted their work. The administrator also needs to determine
the fate of the collected sample.<P>


B. The BS/MBR virus infected system<P>

By definition this should not happen on a FAR-protected system.
Suppose for example that someone booted an infected floppy while
the regular user was on vacation.<P>

The FAR response is:<P>

1. identify the ITW virus<BR>
2. save a sample of the MBR or BS<BR>
3. clean the MBR or BS<BR>
4. reboot the clean system<BR>
5. create an infection report<BR>
6. send the report and sample to the virus administrator when
possible<BR>
7. integrate the infection report into the virus administrator's
summary<P>

Again, the user continues to work without interruption, the
administrator knows what is happening and statistics are gathered.<P>


C. The file virus exposure<P>

This looks much like the response to the exposure to the infected
floppy BS but additionally deals with an object that must be
executed. There will be cases where the "clean the virus"
requirement may not be able to be fulfilled. If this situation
exists, all other FAR requirements should be fulfilled.<P>

1.        identify the ITW virus on copy, execution, etc.<BR>
2.        save a sample of the file<BR>
3.        clean the object if not write protected<BR>
4.        perform the originally requested action (copy, execute,
          etc.) if possible<BR>
5.        create an infection report<BR>
6.        send the report and sample to the virus administrator
          when possible<BR>
7.        integrate the infection report into the virus
          administrator's summary<P>

As with the infected floppy exposure, several things happen in
this instance:<P>

1.        the user continues working with a clean executable that
          does not later infect the system<BR>
2.        the administrator knows what the user is exposed to
          before the organization gets infected by it<BR>
3.        virus incident statistics are automatically compiled<P>

Again, failure to restore a write protected file is not sufficient
reason to interrupt the user. Disinfection failure is forwarded to
the virus administrator who makes the appropriate decisions.<P>

Same cleanup as the BS exposure: The virus administrator needs to
determine how and when the user is notified of the problem that
could have disrupted their work. The administrator also needs to
determine the fate of the collected sample.<P>
 

D. The file virus infection<P>

File infections come in a huge variety of infection types and
techniques. In some cases the virus is non-resident which makes it
easy to deal with. In others it may be prudent to use the resident
virus. Some viruses are so virulent that they must be removed from
memory entirely. The exact technique or series of steps to
disinfect the system is dictated by the virus type and capability.
However, the goal is the same: remove the virus without user
intervention, get a sample, and make a report.<P>

In this case, we imagine an executable that is infected without
FAR protection and the subsequent starting of this system thus
makes the virus resident. Let's say someone booted their own
floppy, infected the system, and left. The virus infection will be
active when the system is subsequently booted by the regular user.<P>

The general FAR response is:<P>

1. identify the ITW virus infection<BR>
2. establish a clean environment or change configuration if
desired or necessary<BR>
3. secure a sample of the virus<BR>
4. restore the infected objects or delete companions<BR>
5. create the infection report<BR>
6. restore the system to an operational configuration if
necessary<BR>
7. start or restart the system<BR>
8. send the report and sample to the virus administrator when
possible<BR>
9. integrate the infection report into the virus administrator's
summary<P>

The order of some items can be changed depending on the
implementation philosophy. The point is to get a sample, remove
the virus, and notify the appropriate party when possible.<P>

While the user may get a little show as the system is restoring
itself, the user goes to work with  minimum interruption once the
restoration is completed, the administrator knows what is
happening, and statistics are gathered.<P>


E. The multipartite virus exposure and infection<P>

The FAR response for the multipartite is much like the BS and file
exposure and infection responses with the added requirement of the
additional object restoration.<P>

Again the user continues to work without an interruption, the
administrator knows what is happening, and statistics are
gathered.<P>


8. When NOT to FAR<P>

Not doing FAR does not mean not doing all FAR tasks. Steps which
can be taken, should be taken. In many cases, this requires
notifying the user and possibly creating an interruption. If
nothing else,  a sample should be gathered and a report created.
The report can be sent if or when practical. If there must be a
workplace interruption, the user can be directed to call the Help
Desk with a message.<P>

There are times when you don't want FAR. For example, FAR is not
appropriate when removing the virus would deny access to data (in
whatever form this may take). In this case it may be necessary to
backup data while the virus is present and then remove the virus.
Years ago this concept was illustrated by the Volga virus. FAR is
not impossible with Volga or One-half; there just may not be
enough use of the particular FAR technique to warrant the expense
of developing it.<P>

Another instance would be when your FAR product meets an anti-AV
product that is FAR hostile. Theoretically this should not happen
as the FAR response should be to remove the virus without "setting
off the bomb".<P>

Other non-FAR situations occur when the object is write protected.
This can be a file on the server, a write protected floppy, or
some write protection on the workstation. These situations are
non-FAR where cleaning the object is concerned, but should still
be FAR-handled when possible.<P>

AV developers may decide to make different viruses FAR and non-
FAR. The definition of a non-FAR virus is "that virus for which no
AV developer can provide a software-only solution". Not all AV
developers are created equally. I wouldn't be surprised to see
some "partial-FAR solutions" for those that lack the skills for a
complete solution. I'm sure we will see some viruses considered
non-FAR because the virus is not sufficiently in the wild to
warrant the work necessary for the FAR solution. There are many
shades of gray that the tailor may use.<P>


9. FAR Benefits<P>

Of course, the benefits are obvious. The enterprise has software
do all the work and the security and network administrators get
all the credit. The software even justifies itself for you. The
benefit for AV developers is new product potential, significantly
less user technical support is required, and enterprise users have
the justification to re-license next year.<P>


10. FAR Evaluation<P>

I hope that FAR product evaluation does not parallel many of the
current testing and evaluations. If the evaluation does not make a
good case for the utility of the product and properly evaluate it,
we should disregard the test. FAR testing should primarily be
concerned with the ability of the product to do the job (and the
job is viruses). Tests that are not primarily concerned with the
ability of the product to do the job for which it was designed
should be ignored.<P>

We, the community that needs and will use FAR should require that
all primary testing is geared to the security aspect of the
product which is dealing with ITW viruses. Other tests for ease of
use for administrators should be clearly labeled as secondary
tests, not directly measuring the product for its primary job of
dealing with ITW viruses. Objective conclusions pertain to the
primary job of the product; Subjective conclusions pertain to the
secondary job of the product.<P>


11. Conclusion<P>

FAR is what users want<BR>
FAR saves organizational resources (money) responding to virus
incidents<BR>
FAR makes almost all viruses in the enterprise environment a non-
event<BR>
FAR takes no technology other than what is already in use to
implement<BR>
FAR will be a reality when we demand it<P>

The question is not "do we need it?", the question is "when will
it be provided?". I'll bet the first AV developer that produces a
working version will find that it is "the better mousetrap". Just
open the door.<P>
