      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Before macro viruses became 
        widely spread, viruses written in one system (one platform) had a limited 
        area for their activity.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">PC viruses were happily 
        infecting DOS based IBM compatibles, MAC viruses lived and replicated 
        on Macintosh family machines; and somewhere far away worms were traveling 
        through the Unix systems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Some time later Windows 
        and OS/2 infectors surfaced, but they were still limited to their own 
        'paddocks'.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It wasn't until the MSWord 
        was able to access documents created on different platforms that viruses 
        successfully overcame the limitations of differing systems. PCs and Macs 
        working in one network (or exchanging documents) could now be infected 
        with one and the same virus.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Even big networks with thousands 
        of machines look tiny in comparison to the biggest 'organism' ever - the 
        Internet. With millions of users this 'monster' links all varieties of 
        different systems and platforms.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It's hard to imagine the 
        software creature endangering the integrity of all those systems but is 
        there anything that can 'bother' all Internet users, no matter what computer 
        and system they use?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">At present, the answer is 
        surprisingly obvious - YES!!!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The vast majority of us 
        (or maybe all?), at least once (probably more), have seen the warning 
        against a 'completely new' and 'totally destructive' virus. The contents 
        of such a message was almost hard to believe but behind the text stood 
        the list of recipients, people who read the warning before and forwarded 
        it to others, certainly taking the information seriously.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Starting with the GoodTimes 
        through the Irina and PenpallGreetings to AOL4FREE, the hoaxes have become 
        the integral part of the Internet reality.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1. VIRUSES OF MINDS</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Passing a virus can be a 
        result of an intentional, deliberate distribution of malicious code or, 
        as it happens more often, can be unintentional and accidental passing 
        the viral code along with disks, documents or programs that are believed 
        to be clean and harmless. In the case of hoaxes, the operation of resending 
        a message is always done consciously although almost always in good faith.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">We know well the condition 
        necessary to qualify code as viral; for a virus to be a virus, it must 
        replicate, i.e. it must pass its code further on and infect other executable 
        objects. Can we look at hoaxes as some specific new type of virus? Rather 
        not, but let's stretch our imagination for a moment; let's imagine a program 
        that, when executed, shows a detailed instruction of how to attach its 
        code to another clean program, how to modify the selected target in order 
        to control its execution. Would it be enough to think about such a creature 
        as a virus? Probably not yet. What about if the displayed message is convincing 
        enough to make every reader follow the instructions and attach the malicious 
        code to at least one clean program. It would mean, that every time our 
        example code is executed, someone would follow the orders, as a result 
        every time the program was run, it would be replicated. Would it be enough 
        to call such code a virus?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Maybe this is enough reason 
        to call it a virus; and how would you make someone follow the viruses’ 
        instructions? There is a way! Trick users into thinking that they are 
        doing something good and useful.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">When the discussion about 
        the reality of the threat described in the Good Times hoax started, one 
        of the participants in the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup - Clay Shirky 
        stated: &quot;It's for real. It's an opportunistic self-replicating e-mail 
        virus which tricks its host into replicating it, sometimes adding as many 
        as 200,000 copies at a go. It works by finding hosts with defective parsing 
        apparatus which prevents them from understanding that a piece of e-mail 
        which says there is an e-mail virus and then asking them to re-mail the 
        message to all their friends is the virus itself.&quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It seems that different 
        users decide to re-send the hoax for different reasons; some are really 
        scared by the potential effect, while others find references to widely 
        known authorities a good reason to trust a whole message. Generally speaking, 
        a hoax is passed on when a user believes that a danger is real and a warning 
        itself helpful and worth forwarding. This has a direct impact on how we 
        can limit the spread of hoaxes; it seems like the main problem here is 
        how to change popular believes.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">2. HOAXES AND THE 
        EVOLUTION</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">When one takes a closer 
        look at the thousands of existing viruses (or at least at the naming lists), 
        one can quickly realise that, most of them belong to broader families 
        or groups sharing certain common features. These can be similar code, 
        ways of installing in memory, methods of finding targets for an infection, 
        stealth techniques, encryption scheme or polymorphic engines applied. 
        Looking inside one specific group we can discover the history of the code 
        modification, e.g. in case of some file infectors, we can trace their 
        development starting from simple direct .com infectors, through memory 
        resident and encrypted infectors, up to stealth and polymorphic variations. 
        The chronology and the genealogical trees of some families are not always 
        clear and retraceable but modifications and common roots are usually easy 
        to spot.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Fingering through the slowly 
        growing list of the Internet hoaxes, one cannot miss an obvious analogy; 
        introduced changes, cuts and new additions show us the way hoaxes develop 
        and mutate. The fact that some new hoaxes are based on the previous ones 
        is unquestionable. Although hoax modifications are unlimited in their 
        potential numbers (in the same way as unlimited is the variation in size 
        and contents of any ASCII text file) its functionality always stays the 
        same. As annoying and worrisome as all hoaxes are, they remind us of a 
        virus where modifications are solely changes to its internal text strings 
        or displayed messages.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Appendix A presents 
        some of the most characteristic forms of the Good Times hoax in, what 
        seems to be, according to Les Jones' 'Good Times Virus Hoax FAQ', the 
        chronological order. The changes are as obvious as the common parts but 
        the time and the sequence in which specific variations were created can 
        only be based on dates they appeared in somebody's mailbox and were kept 
        for further references.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The similar problem occurs 
        when we try to compare different hoaxes; it is difficult to say anything 
        more than they are based on the same idea.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">3. WHEN IS A HOAX 
        NOT EXACTLY A HOAX</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">We tend to think about hoaxes 
        as the annoying messages with completely meaningless contents having only 
        one goal; to be re-sent and passed on. The fact that a message speculates 
        about nothing real is what makes a hoax a hoax.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Claims that such and such 
        program destroys your system when executed, when the program in question 
        can be easily checked and confirmed as being harmless, are usually classified 
        into the category of urban legends rather than hoaxes. Problems arise 
        when a program that is mentioned in a message can't be located or at least 
        not in a form matching a description as it was in the case of the Budsave 
        (alias Bud Frogs) hoax.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Another reason why some 
        of the urban legends end up listed as hoaxes, is the large number of users 
        that receive the same warning. Some known examples from this group of 
        hoaxes are Ghost, Eyes and Sheep.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">All of the above accuse 
        different legitimate and clean programs for being malicious and destructive 
        Trojans.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">4. LIFE IS GETTING 
        COMPLICATED</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The first wave of the Good 
        Times hoax started spreading at the end of 1994 and it lost its impact 
        relatively quickly. Maybe the hoax wasn't lucky enough at that time or 
        maybe the number of Internet users wasn't big enough to support continuous 
        reposting. In the same time it seemed like the average Internet user, 
        in the Internet's early years, was more technically educated and could 
        better understand the nature of the hoax. The second wave, triggered about 
        a year later, was much more powerful; reached more users and lasted much 
        longer (probably still does). It became significant enough to trigger 
        the reaction of the real virus writers. About half a year after the first 
        copies of the hoax were posted, the electronically published VLAD magazine 
        included the source code of a new file virus named by its author: &quot;Good 
        Times&quot; (see Appendix B). Suddenly, the technical support staff in 
        anti-virus companies or other computer security oriented organisations 
        could no longer say: &quot;Don't worry, the Good Times virus don't ist&quot;. 
        We were forced into a position where simple 'yes' or 'no' wasn't a correct 
        answer and any more explanations didn't always clear the confusion for 
        the anxious user.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The industry has found a 
        way around this problem, it's been agreed to relate to the virus as GT.Spoof. 
        Since the virus GT.Spoof has never been successfully spreading in the 
        wild, such a solution turned out to satisfy everyone. Another milestone 
        in the history of the Good Times hoax was a creation of a spoof of the 
        hoax. Known as the Good Times Spoof or the Badtimes hoax (see Appendix 
        C), it has never become a serious problem and forwarding it to others 
        was recognised as sharing a good joke rather than a warning. Interestingly, 
        it has found its place on the CIAC web page dedicated to Internet hoaxes.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">5. LIFE IS GETTING 
        EVEN MORE COMPLICATED</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After the Good Times issue 
        complexity, another hoax created even more confusion. When the AOL4FREE 
        hoax surfaced and started quickly spreading through the net, it became 
        obvious that this time, the hoax is regarded as a part, a modification 
        or an extension of an already existing program called AOL4FREE. Written 
        for Macintosh, the program was a malicious hack, providing users with 
        an illegal, free access to the America Online services. At the time the 
        hoax appeared the author of the original hack was found and he subsequently 
        pleaded guilty. The AOL charging methods were again secured.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The following events are 
        somehow similar to the Good Times' story; another program AOL4FREE.COM 
        appeared and once again, the answer to the question: 'is the AOL4FREE 
        only a hoax?' It had to be verified. This time, it turned out that the 
        AOL4FREE.COM was a compiled form of a batch program and it was not a virus 
        but simple (and quite malignant) trojan deleting files from drive C: on 
        the machine it was run on. So, when in the case of the Good Times we had 
        problems with a virus triggered by the hoax, now we are facing the problem 
        of a trojan, based on a hoax that was based on an illegal hack. One doesn't 
        need to mention that this confused the Internet users even more and triggered 
        a real avalanche of questions and even bigger variety of more or less 
        correct answers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One of the important things 
        to say here, before we put the complete blame on users resending the hoax 
        and asking the endless questions regarding all three issues of the AOL4FREE 
        'affair', is to say that users had every right to be confused. How can 
        we expect everyone to instantly recognise the true and the false warnings, 
        when even some of the anti-virus authorities became victims of simpler 
        and easier to identify hoaxes?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;6. CAN WE HELP?</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In the era of fast life, 
        fast food and easy 'precooked' recipes for everything, the users and especially 
        customers demand, and I guess, are entitled to, simple answers and quick 
        remedies to all their worries. Can we prepare a checklist that let us 
        identify a new hoax and separate it from other legitimate virus warnings? 
        It seems like a simple and 100% proof rule is not possible, but there 
        are number of signs and features that are regularly present inside the 
        hoax messages, and identifying those will help while deciding whether 
        to take a warning seriously or to transfer it to the trash folder. The 
        list of common indicators of a hoax could read as follows:</FONT>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The user is encouraged to 
        pass a message on to other users;</FONT>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The potential virus is 
          always described as extremely disastrous;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The explanation uses 
          incorrect terms and describes impossible events;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The description is often 
          impossible to understand because of its quasi scientific terminology;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The warning often quotes 
          opinions originated by widely recognised authorities;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The message uses a lot 
          of exclamation marks and upper case characters;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The alert always claims 
          being sent in good faith ;</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The user will notice 
          a number of spelling and grammar mistakes.</FONT>
      </UL>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Helping users deal with 
        their confusion and finding answers to their questions means, first of 
        all, providing sufficient information. Chasing users with the right information 
        and sending a message explaining the hoax to a large number of users will 
        be as annoying as sending the hoax itself. On the other hand, making the 
        information easily available to those in need, and directing users to 
        other reliable sources of information will be the best move and will at 
        least limit the scale of the hoax problem.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Every time someone 
        recognised as an authority in the anti-virus or computer security filed, 
        issues a misleading statement or confirms the validity of a hoax, the 
        efforts of others trying to stop the flood are to the certain degree wasted.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;As it was mentioned 
        in the chapter 'Viruses Of Minds', helping users to recognise a new hoax 
        can very often lead us into trying to change some common believes. It 
        seems obvious that in real life, as a far as faith is concerned, introducing 
        any changes can be hard and painful (see Appendix D).</FONT></P>
      <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;7. ARE WE SENTENCED 
        TO LIFE</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The discussion about 
        the virus threat, how to end it and how long it will be a part of our 
        everyday life hasn't given us a final and conclusive answer. When we thought 
        that we were getting somewhere, the macro viruses appeared and are currently 
        conquering the computing world. We had to change our definitions and redefined 
        our approach to the virus problem. It seems like old 'DOS' viruses (still 
        growing in numbers) and especially macro viruses, given a new vehicle 
        in the Office 97 suite programs (VBA5), will stay with us for some time.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;We know that false 
        alarms cost us as much as lack of detection, they are much more annoying 
        but, so far, impossible to exterminate. The hoaxes, similar in their unjustified 
        warnings to the false positive alarms, will more than likely become another 
        part of the Internet (and Intranets) life. Certainly we will not be able 
        to limit the spread of hoaxes by using a method described in the Good 
        Times FAQ:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&quot;What's the best 
        way to control a thought virus? Create a counter virus like this one as 
        an antidote. To make the counter virus contagious, include instruction 
        such as, 'The Good Times e-mail virus is a hoax. If anyone repeats the 
        hoax, please show them the FAQ.' &quot;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;If we were to take 
        this approach, it would be probably more effective to convince all of 
        the recipients of a hoax to return the same message to a sender. It could 
        be a very effective way of limiting the spreading of the hoax and, in 
        the same time it would teach a valuable lesson.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;With time, one would 
        like to expect that more users will be able to identify a new hoax without 
        alarming the rest of the community. Forwarding it only to the authorities 
        in order to add it to the lists maintained by the different organisations 
        and thereby making it accessible to everyone online.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Because of the extremely 
        fast development of new platforms, and applications the ability to achieve 
        these results can be only speculative. And, therefore it is impossible 
        to give 100% assurance regarding a hoax; as hoaxes seem to trigger people 
        to write malicious code that makes the hoax at least in part valid or 
        real.</FONT>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;What makes this virus

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;HI, During the night 
        of 7 to 11th of April 1997, 4600+ computer systems in US, UK, ZA, AU where 
        infected with a virus, which destroyed the boot partition of their hard 
        drives.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I don't know about 
        you.. I would prefer not to open such a surprise. This report was passed

        the anti-virus industry for over 6 years, I know how destructive they 
        can be, but believe me the cost of people spreading hoaxes is just as 
        significant as the cost of a virus infection.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I don't care if 
        you got the information from IBM it is still a hoax and now that you know 
        perhaps your should tell all the people you have been e-mailing that you 
        were mistaken.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;By the way, the 
        night 7th-11th of April must have been a pretty long one no wonder so 
        many boot sectors were corrupted:)</FONT></I></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;This statement may 
        be copied or reprinted by online users</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The American Cancer 
        Society is greatly disturbed by reports of a fraudulent chain letter circulating 
        on the internet which lists the American Cancer Society as a &quot;corporate 
        sponsor&quot; but which has in no way been endorsed by the American Cancer 
        Society. This letter appears to have started on America Online but has 
        now spread well beyond the online service. There are several variations 
        of this letter in circulation. The text of the original message reads 
        as follows:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK 
        IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM AN ACUTE AND VERY RARE CASE OF 
        CEREBRAL CARCINOMA. THIS CONDITION CAUSES SEVERE MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS 
        AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS. THE DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;AS PART OF HER DYING 
        WISH, SHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THIS CONDITION 
        AND TO SEND PEOPLE THE MESSAGE TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND ENJOY EVERY 
        MOMENT, A CHANCE THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE. FURTHERMORE, THE AMERICAN CANCER 
        SOCIETY AND SEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO DONATE THREE CENTS 
        TOWARD CONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR EVERY NEW PERSON THAT GETS FORWARDED 
        THIS MESSAGE. PLEASE GIVE JESSICA AND ALL CANCER VICTIMS A CHANCE.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, 
        SEND THEM TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AT ACS@AOL.COM.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;As far as the American 
        Cancer Society can determine, the story of Jessica Mydek is completely 
        unsubstantiated. No fundraising efforts are being made by the American 
        Cancer Society in her name or by the use of chain letters. Furthermore, 
        the email address ACS@AOL.COM is inactive. Any messages to the American 
        Cancer Society should be instead sent through the American Cancer Society 
        website at</FONT><A HREF="http://www.cancer.org/"><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">http://www.cancer.org</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica"> 
        .</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;This particular chain 
        letter with its heartbreaking story appears to have struck an emotional 
        chord with online users. Although we are very concerned that the American 
        Cancer Society's name has been used to manipulate the online public, we 
        applaud the good intentions of all who participated in this letter. We 
        are pleased to note that there are so many caring individuals out there 
        and hope that they will find another way to support cancer research. Jessica 
        Mydek's story, whether true or false, is representative of that of many 
        cancer patients who benefit daily from the efforts of legitimate cancer 
        organizations nationwide.</FONT></P>

        beware software surveys/offers</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;We have been alerted 
        to the following scam - please read and pass on to anyone that could be 
        affected.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;There is a big scam 
        going on where a person calls and says that they are doing a computer 
        survey from a company. The company name that they give is usually a big 
        well-known software company, and they usually say that they are doing 
        the survey because they want to give out free software.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;They want to know 
        what would be a good time for someone to come from their company and install 
        the software on your PC. They also ask questions about income, etc. During 
        their questioning, they (unknowingly to you) find out what time you're 
        usually home, what kind of computer equipment you have and all sorts of 
        other valuable information.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;At a company where 
        a friend of mine works, a co-worker of his received one of these calls, 
        and he was robbed the very next day (of course, when he was not home). 
        I received a similar call yesterday afternoon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Fortunately, I knew 
        about this ahead of time, and didn't provide them with any information. 
        I want to make you all aware of the situation and the potential danger 
        involved in giving out any information like this over the phone.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The people sound very 
        genuine, and very few people are going to question receiving free software. 
        I would advise you, however, to tell the people that if they have your 
        phone number, they should have your address, and they can mail you any 
        free software they might be offering.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;If you have a home 
        computer set-up, you should be familiar with installing your own software. 
        You may even want to tell them you don't have a home computer. Whatever 
        you're comfortable with.</FONT></P>
