This paper is intended to inform the UNIX and computer communities 
about formally undocumented computer virus problems.  My 
observation of these problems were made at heterogeneous UNIX 
network sites and confirmed by discussions with system administrators 
at other sites.  I believe that these problems are not limited to UNIX or 
heterogeneous networks.  Furthermore, I expect the problems to 
expand in complexity, scope and virulence. 
<p>
I have observed non-UNIX personal computers attached to a 
heterogeneous network that were infected with computer viruses 
originating from UNIX workstations.  The UNIX systems were not the 
original point of entry for  the viruses.  The viruses were dormant 
while on the UNIX nodes and became harmful when they migrated to 
their target systems.  The UNIX systems acted as unaffected carriers of 
computer viruses for other platforms of computers.  For the sake of 
simplicity, I have coined the phrase &quot;Typhoid Mary Syndrome&quot; when 
describing this problem. 
<p>
Typhoid Mary was an unfortunate New York City carrier of Typhoid 
Fever in the 1930's.  Although Mary was an unaffected carrier of the 
disease, she unknowingly spread it to members of almost every 
establishment in which she was employed.   The similarities between 
Typhoid Mary and the computer problem named Typhoid Mary 
Syndrome are close. 
<p>
Networks and specifically UNIX because of its ability to provide 
networked file systems are susceptible to this problem.  Using an 
example of MS-DOS personal computers on a network of UNIX 
systems, the Typhoid Mary Syndrome would be in effect if the viruses 
that were targeted against the MS-DOS platforms migrated to the 
UNIX systems.  Once on the UNIX system, the viruses remain 
dormant until they migrate to an MS-DOS platform. 
<p>
I became aware of this problem when I took part in the investigation of 
an infection of personal computers on a network with a large 
population of UNIX workstations and servers.  The virus was 
manually attacked on the personal computers using virus scanners.  
During the infection, all of the target platform computers were 
disconnected from the network and unused.  All removable media was 
checked.  Once all infected files were identified and removed, the 
personal computers were reattached to the network.  A few weeks 
later, a sanity check, using the same virus scanner, was performed on 
the target platform with positive results.  The same computer virus 
strain had reinfected the systems.  Since the systems and all removable 
media had been cleansed, the network came under suspicion. 
<p>
In retrospect, this problem had to exist.  The use of network file 
systems that were exported from the UNIX platform to the personal 
computer platforms provided an easy, powerful method of transferring 
data, including executables.  Some network designs provide all third 
party software from a network disk for ease of maintenance and 
reduced storage overhead.  This easy access provides an open door for 
viruses.  What I found surprising was the fact that the viruses were 
able to migrate out of the common storage areas into users' home 
directories.  Users had several reasons for performing this action, the 
most prevalent being, to have a &quot;safe&quot; copy of the program.  
Additional methods of migration may exist that I have not considered.  
Some migration functions may be a deliberate act of the virus 
designer.  This may be accomplished using a similar design as 
demonstrated by the Internet Worm which was able to migrate to 
dissimilar UNIX systems and then adapt to its new host environment. 
<p>
The most obvious method of reducing the possibility of the Typhoid 
Mary Syndrome is to carefully regulate and control what type of files 
can move  between platforms.  Although it is possible to infect data 
files, the virus would be rendered harmless in a non-executable file.  It 
is therefore reasonable to assume that the movement of data files such 
as word processing documents across platforms is safe. <i> March 1996, 
Not any more! WinWord Concept Virus has proven this wrong. - pvr</i> 
<p>
The examples presented have been the result of direct single action 
events such as a user copying MS-DOS executables over the network.  
When the problem enters multilevel action events or includes time 
delay events, then the complexity of the problem increases.  If the 
virus copied had been the Friday the 13th virus and the re-infection 
had been delayed by external events, then the results of the infection 
on the target machine would be felt at a variable time plus the time 
required to reach activation after the initial transfer of the virus to the 
carrier system.  &quot;Effective Interval:, Ei = Td + Ta where;  Td = delay 
in transfer to target, Ta = positive value activation interval.  A third 
level of complexity is introduced through the import and export of 
files. Files can be imported through may sources, including removable 
media such as magnetic tape.  There have been several documented 
cases of manufacturers delivering shrink-wrapped software which 
contained viruses. A fourth level of complexity can be introduced 
through the use of Wide Area Networks such as the Internet or more 
traditional computer bulletin boards. 
<p>
In addition to the Typhoid Mary Syndrome, there are several other 
types of harmful software that are native to and targeted against UNIX 
systems.  They are Trojan horses, logic bombs and worms.  Worms 
require considerable commitment and a strong understanding of the 
UNIX system to write.  For the immediate future,  worm attacks will 
be rare due to the skill required to author one.  As has happened  with 
computer viruses, that skill may become more common place if anyone 
publishes  the source code to a worm.  The increasing availability of 
UNIX systems could combine  with a &quot;recipe&quot; to place the required 
skill and systems into the hands of otherwise  ineffective potential 
authors. 
<p>
Trojan horses and logic bombs are simple programs that can be 
written by  programmers of high school skill level.  Trojan horses 
appear to be performing desired processing while creating damage.  
They are spread by unsuspecting users who copy them in order to take 
advantage of their usefulness.  Many Trojan horses are hidden in 
computer games.  A recent Trojan horse that was spread via the 
Internet was called &quot;choosegirl.game&quot;. 
<p>
Logic bombs or time bombs are simple programs that wait for an event 
to occur such as midnight and then damage the system.  A simple time 
bomb might wait until 10 minutes before a scheduled system backup 
and then destroy the file system. 
<p>
Viruses that directly target UNIX systems have been written and 
demonstrated under controlled research conditions.  The first 
computer virus ever written was for the UNIX system.  Viruses are not 
currently a major problem for UNIX, however, as the popularity of the 
UNIX system grows, so will the treat.

<b>====================================================================<br>
I have chosen to keep this paper almost as originally published in 1991 
with just a few touch-ups while the bulk of the updates are contained 
in Post Notes.  I think this should interest people researching the 
history of UNIX anti-virus development. - pvr<br>

<h2><i>Post Note:  July 1994</i> </h2>

This paper now appears to me as dated.  The number of viruses that 
directly attack UNIX systems has increased, although they are still 
small in number.  Currently, there are the AT&amp;T Virus, (a.k.a.: 
Usenix Virus), the Ls Virus and the Chapter-13 Virus.  There is also a 
compiler defiler &quot;virus&quot;, however, it has not been found in the wild 
and therefore does not count.  Additionally, UNIX systems now 
directly execute Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS and Apple Mac 
executables in emulation mode.  These emulators are all directly 
susceptible to attack.  Beside the emulation mode, UNIX executing on 
IBM PC type platforms has been found, in the wild, executing MS-
DOS viruses.  The MS-DOS virus infected UNIX executables.  The 
processor and BIOS are both the same and many viruses can co-exist 
on both platforms.  I assume that the same will be true of Apple 
Mac(s) and all other systems that can run UNIX.

<h2><i>Post Post Note:  March 1996</i> </h2>

Every time I review this paper, the greater my smile.  For the last 5 
years, some of the companies in the anti-virus industry have been 
telling my customers not to purchase UNIX anti-virus products and 
have poo poo'ed this paper.  As of  this month, it seems that everyone 
is jumping on the bandwagon.   At least two well known anti-virus 
companies are claiming to be first on the market with a UNIX anti-
virus product.  Shame on them for not telling the truth when they have 
been picking up my product literature and white papers since 1990!   
<p>
It's nice to be vindicated, even at the cost of increased competition. 
<p>
In addition, the number of attack programs directed against UNIX is 
increasing.  Many people dismiss everything that is not a virus, 
however, my argument is that if the program destroys your system, do 
you care that it wasn't a virus?  The following is a list of UNIX 
specific pattern models that VFind Version 5.0 Release 0 has in its 
internal database.  There are also external databases delivered with the 
product. 
<p>
<pre>
attack1         AT&amp;T Attack Virus (a.k.a. Usenix Virus) (1) 
attack2         AT&amp;T Attack Virus (a.k.a. Usenix Virus) (2) 
attack3         AT&amp;T Attack Virus (a.k.a. Usenix Virus) (3)

chptr13a        Chapter 13 Virus                        (2) 
vdlcode1        Internet Worm Grappler

trjpswd4        Trojan Backdoor Sendmail Attack             * 
</pre>
<p>
The following is included in the VFind 5.0 Release 0 &quot;cyber01.vdl&quot; 
external database. 
<p>
<pre>
Trojan Bin Remove Attack (1)    Generic recursive remove from 
				   root directory   (1) * 
Trojan Bin Remove Attack (2)    Generic recursive remove from 
				   root directory   (2) 
Trojan Passwd Steal By Mail (4) Generic Password Steal By Mail (4) * 
Trojan Passwd Steal By Mail (5) Generic Password Steal By Mail (5) * 
</pre>
<p>
* - We have labeled this a Trojan Horse attack, however, the code is a
very popular payload for all types of attack and can easily be used in
a virus. 
<p>
<p>
The following will be added in VFind Version 5.1 Release 1 internal 
database. 
<p>
<pre>
X21             X21 UNIX Virus 
X23             X23 UNIX Virus 
</pre>
<p>
In addition, all PC Boot Sector Viruses destroy UNIX on PC systems.  
In 1994, there were no observed PC Boot Sector Virus infections on 
Unix systems in the wild.  On March 6, 1995 an entire international 
network of Unix on PC systems was destroyed  by Michelangeo with 
many smaller repeat performances in 1996. 
<p>
Many MS-DOS specific viruses can also execute on PC based UNIX 
systems but they do not usually infect files correctly.   The normal 
result is a destroyed file system from attempted infection.  Slow 
infectors tend to cause corruption of the file system while fast infectors 
destroy the system within minutes.  There was one observed case, in 
the wild, of a pure MS-DOS virus infecting a Unix compiled COBOL 
program.  This program was executed by &quot;cron&quot; every night and the 
file system was destroyed.   It took the victim approximately a week to 
determine that they were not suffering a hardware failure because they 
reloaded the virus from their backup tapes every morning.   (They 
were not a customer at the time. &lt;smile&gt;)
