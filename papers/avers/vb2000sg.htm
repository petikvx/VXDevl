<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Earlier research has empirically demonstrated the cyclic
nature of virus writing activity: as virus writers “age out”, new virus writers
take their places. Enhanced connectivity amplifies the existing problem and
various technical factors result in new types of virus writers surfacing as the
cycle repeats. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>However, a new variable has recently been introduced into
the cycle: high profile legal intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The virus writing community now has experienced visits by concerned law
enforcement personnel; there have been arrests and there will be sentencings.
New laws are being considered, enacted, and acted upon. Thus, the virus writing
scene is no longer a casual pastime of kids on local Bulletin Board
Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>What has been the impact, perceptually and operationally,
of these visits, arrests, and sentencings? In other words, as the virus problem
gets more and more “real world” attention, where are we actually going in terms
of shaping acceptable behavior in our virtual communities and what, if any,
effect are these legal interventions having on the impact of viruses upon
users’ computers?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In order to produce a scientifically meaningful answer to
this question, pre and post intervention data on various aspects of the virus
problem have been gathered. We solicited opinions on a variety of topics
related to computer viruses and legal countermeasures via e-mail and direct
survey. Opinions are not only interesting; they must be considered, as we know
the opinions of today shape how people behave in the future.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, we are also concerned with
immediate real-world impact. To this end, impact will be examined in terms of
viruses found both In the Wild<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"

(ItW) and on the World Wide Web (WWW), as a function of time. The data gathered
before and after various types of high profile intervention is considered; in
particular we are interested in any decrease noted in the graph of virus growth
both ItW and on the WWW, and in online references to legal concerns. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>An analysis of the data is presented and suggestions for
future research are made.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the last eight years, a wealth of information has
been gathered concerning virus writers and the various motivations behind their
work (Gordon, 1994a; Gordon, 1994b; Gordon, 1995; Gordon, 1996; Gordon, 1999).
In this paper, that earlier research is expanded upon and updated to consider
an increasingly important facet: intervention by legal/government bodies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is natural, given the way societies tend to develop, that
antisocial activities tend to lead to legislation designed to contain or
eradicate the activities. This paradigm of control is influencing both
technological development and societal direction (Gordon, 1994b). There is now
increased pressure on the legislature and law enforcement to deal with a
problem which purportedly costs corporations millions of dollars per year
(Cobb, 1998). The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the efficacy of
high-profile legal countermeasures, and assess how well they achieve the
objective of lessening the spread of computer viruses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to accomplish this analysis, this paper is
structured as follows: First, the research to date is summarized, in order to
provide the reader with insight on the “generic” virus writer, the target of
laws and intervention. Second, the legal countermeasures which are in place at
the time of writing are discussed, outlining the goal of legislation, and summarizing
the laws employed in past high-profile arrests of virus writers. Next, the
potential drawbacks and costs associated with this approach are discussed, to
provide a counterpoint to the intuitively obvious application of laws and high
profile interventions as a solution to the “problems” of virus writing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The lack of useful metrics as to the
effectiveness of the legal approach is covered, before discussing a research
methodology that provides scientifically valid data for assessing the result of
the interventions. Finally, results of this research are presented, analysing
the effectiveness of laws in the prevention of virus writing and various forms
of distribution.</p>

<h3>Virus Writer Demographics</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Research published by (Gordon, 1994a) examined the demographics
of a large number of virus writers. This was accomplished by the use of
surveys, email interviews, online chat and in-person sessions. The data
gathered was used to assess the ethical development<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>
of individual virus writers, with a view to understanding why they chose to
write viruses, and what, if anything, was likely to deter them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The paper focused on four primary groups of people: the
adolescent virus writer, the college student, the adult virus writer, and the
ex-virus writer. The findings for each group are summarized below<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></a></span>.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Adolescent<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies of the adolescent virus writer were remarkably
consistent. The data tend to show that the adolescent virus writer is ethically
normal and of average/above average intelligence. Responses from members of
this group showed respect for their parents and for authority (to some degree).
While members of the group tended to understand the difference between what is
right and wrong, (i.e. directly damaging data that belongs to other people is
wrong) they typically did not accept any responsibility for problems caused
when their own viruses appeared in the wild.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The College Student<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Members of this group also appeared to be ethically normal
on the Kohlberg scale. Despite expressing that what is illegal is “wrong”,
members of this group were not typically concerned about the results of their
actions related to their virus writing.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Adult<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of the four classes studied, the adult virus writer was the
smallest, and the only one which appeared to be ethically abnormal, appearing
below the level of ethical maturity which would be considered normal on the
Kohlberg scale. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The ex-virus writer<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, this group was ethically normal. The ex-virus
writers typically cited lack of time and boredom with virus writing as the
primary motivator for the cessation of their “hobby”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Appearing socially well adjusted, the ex-virus writer seemed to
bear no ill-will toward other virus writers, and was undecided concerning the
ethical legitimacy of virus writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These results are of particular relevance to the question of
legal countermeasures. The virus writing adults in the study appeared to be
below the norms in ethical development; adults who are below these norms are
more likely to be motivated by fear of punishment than by respect for law. For
the adult virus writer, therefore, it is not the laws that are important, but
their perception of the likelihood of being prosecuted under those laws. For
the minors involved, the presence of laws is unlikely to be very effective for
several different reasons that will be discussed in more detail later. For the
youngest virus writers, it tended to show that virus writing was a naturally
self-limiting phenomenon, and that the “perpetrator” would tend to cease their
activity without the need for legal intervention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The research shown above was completed in 1994. The update
of the paper two years later (Gordon, 1996) showed some disturbing trends
related to virus writers at the higher age limits considered. Whereas virus
writers were typically aging out as their ethical development continued, mixed
messages from many different sources appeared to make virus writing appear
“less wrong”, pushing up the age of aging out, if the process occurred at all. </p>
<p>
<h3>Legal and High Profile Intervention</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>(ICSA,
1999) the median cost of virus disasters is $1,750, with some respondents
reporting costs of up to $100,000 in a single virus incident. Another study
(Ernst, 1998 cited in Cobb, 1998) suggests that virtually every organization in
the world has experienced at least one virus infection, and that viruses
continue to cause businesses hundreds of millions of dollars each year in
damages and lost productivity. Given the purported high cost<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a>
to businesses it is not surprising that some people have looked to the law for
help in dealing with the problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Legal intervention in
the case of the Melissa virus has been highly publicized.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Regarding this case, (Jenislawski, 1999)
citing ICSA, states <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>This
case, the company says, proves that virus writing is ‘indeed illegal’, despite
arguments to the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></i>[This
prosecution]<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> will be a decisive event
that will tend to reduce the relentlessly increasing threat and resultant risk
of computer viruses to society as a whole. By locking up perpetrators, the cycle
of mounting numbers, rate, and virulence of computer viruses will get at least

<p class=MsoNormal>Laws to combat computer crime are not new. The first
comprehensive proposal for computer crime legislation was a federal Bill
introduced in the US Congress by Senator Ribikoff in 1977. (Schjolberg , 2000).
Since that time, many U.S. states have introduced various computer crime laws,
several of which mention viruses specifically (Bordera, 1997). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of these laws and statutes even attempt to define what
a virus is. For example (Bordera, 1997) cites the revision of the State of
Maine’s statute title 17-A, ßß 431 to 433 (West Supp. 1996)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any instruction,
information, data or program that degrades the performance of a computer
resource; disables, damages or destroys a computer resource; or attaches itself
to another computer resource and executes when the host computer program is
executed.</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The State of Maine has a particular subsection dealing with
viruses, ß433c, citing </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“intentional
or knowing introduction or allowing the introduction of a computer virus into
any computer resource, having no reasonable ground to believe that the person
has the right to do so.</i>”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The offense is classified as a Class C crime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In (Froehlich, Pinter, and Witmeyer, 2000) documentation of
differentiation between naivete and malice is made: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The 1994 Computer Abuse Act tries to deal differently with those who
foolheartedly launch viral attacks and those who do so intending to wreak
havoc. To do this, the Act defines two levels of prosecution for those who
create viruses. For those who intentionally cause damage by transmitting a
virus, the punishment can amount to ten years in federal prison, plus a fine.
For those who transmit a virus with only &quot;reckless disregard&quot; to the
damage it will cause, the maximum punishment stops at a fine and a year in
prison.</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>There have since been various committees formed worldwide
that have attempted to deal with the problem from a legal perspective
(Schjolberg, 2000). From some of these committees international laws addressing
computer crime have emerged, some of which address virus issues specifically.
For example, in 1995, the Iranian Government approved a computer crime law
prepared by the High Council of Informatics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Program damage caused by viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and logic bombs
are spelled out in this law. Other countries have laws that forbid the
spreading of and in some cases the writing of, computer viruses (Iran, 2000).
How have the existing laws been used so far? First, we will consider three
individual cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Research by (Akdeniz<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>&amp; Yaman, 1996) documents the case of Dr. Joseph Popp, an American
who was apprehended and arrested by the FBI at the end of 1989. Dr. Popp had
sent free computer diskettes to ~20,000 people in London and around the world;
these disks contained a program which supposedly assessed the user’s risk of
contracting the AIDS/HIV virus, but which in reality introduced a trojan horse
to the users computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to
Akdeniz,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Recipients of the disk were
warned that their computers would stop functioning unless they paid the license
fees of £225 to a bank account in Panama. This case is thought to be the
world’s most ambitious computer crime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While Dr. Joseph Popp was extradited to the UK, his case never came to
trial due to a deterioration of Popp’s mental state; he was found mentally
unfit to stand trial</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Taiwan, 1999) describes how, in 1999, the Computer Crime
Unit traced the CIH virus to a young man then serving in the military. He
confessed he had written the virus, claiming he was motivated by pure research,
and had not himself spread the virus. According to this report, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“if
it were determined that Chen Ying-hao had maliciously disseminated the virus,
he could be sentenced to time in jail. However, many creators of computer
viruses are computer jocks, most of whom write viruses to show off their
computer acumen. As Chen Ying-hao likely belongs to this ilk, and since under
the article in question a prosecution can only be brought if a complaint is
made, it has thus far not been possible to charge Chen, for lack of sufficient
evidence. Prosecutors are currently reviewing the case</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christopher Pile, known as the “Black Baron” in the computer
underground, was sentenced to 18 months on 15 November 1995. Pile was charged
with violations of Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. He pled guilty to
five charges of gaining unauthorized access to computers, five of making
unauthorized modifications and one of inciting others to spread the viruses he
had written. </p>

<h3>Laws – Effective?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for a crime involving a virus to be prosecuted, it
must first be reported. Minnesota statute ßß 609.87 to .89 presents an
amendment which clearly defines a destructive computer program, and which
designates a maximum imprisonment or 10 years; however, no cases have been reported.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Should we conclude there are no virus
problems in Minnesota? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In (Grable,<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>1996)
the ineffectiveness of the laws, both Federal and New York State, as a solution
to the virus problem are clearly spelled out: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“Both
the federal and New York state criminal statutes aimed at virus terror are
ineffective because the methods of enforcement… The combination of the lack of
reporting plus the inherent difficulties in apprehending virus creators leads
to the present situation: unseen and unpunished virus originators doing their
damage unencumbered and unafraid. Add to that the slap on the wrist afforded to
even the most infamous of virus propagators, and the recipe is right for even
greater damage from malevolent software.” <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How likely are laws to affect the young virus writer? We
first examine legal intervention related to young people engaged in other
antisocial activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(McDowall &amp; Loftin,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>2000) analyze the success of curfew laws in controlling crime. They
state that while several police departments report a decrease in youth offenses
after the enforcement of curfew ordinances<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>(Bilchik, 1996) claim that statistics supporting the efficacy of curfew
laws in reducing crime rest on uncertain comparison groups, and that few
evaluations have considered more than a single area. They conclude there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>strong evidence that the curfew laws
reduce juvenile offending or victimization rates. However, despite this lack of
evidence, these laws have been embraced by many communities; (Hemmens &amp;
Bennett, 1999) state that while it is unclear whether they are effective in
reducing crime, it is clear that they are being embraced by communities across
the country (Davidson, 1997).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other studies of youths living in areas where anti-social
activity is normal, some youth may accept confronting danger and being involved
in these activities as features of living in such environments (Halliday &amp;
Graham, 2000). There is insufficient data to conclude if this phenomenon maps
to virtual environments.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">                                 </span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">                        </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Research by (Foglia, 1997) supports the hypothesis that
while the possibility police involvement, or legal sanction does not offer
significant deterrence for youths who engage in antisocial behaviours, they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> likely to be influenced by parents
and peers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In (Gordon, 1994a), the
conclusion that the “common” young virus writer is not likely to be affected by
laws is supported, citing both the non-universality of the laws as well the
mixed messages sent societally to the young people as they integrate into the
cyber-culture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Difficulty in sentencing minors is also to be considered;
some research is being done in this area. (Simpson, 1999) examines research
into state statutes in the United States that help make parents legally responsible
for personal injury or damage to property made by their minor children. There
are details on a case in Minnesota (the land of no viruses <span
style='font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Wingdings'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Wingdings'>J</span></span>),
and another in Oregon, where such provisions currently exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, we must <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>ignore
the mixed messages sent to young people regarding virus writing. (ZiffDavis,
1999) reports<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>“[the firm that hired the virus author]<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>…competed with a score of high-tech rivals attempting to lure </i>[the
virus author]...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>“’Our chairman felt he </span></i><span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>[the virus author]<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> was a rare computer professional and we decided to accept him with an
open heart,’ said Wahoo<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>spokeswoman
Vivi Wang.”<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrast that to the alleged writer of the Melissa virus,
David L. Smith. Apprehended at the beginning of April, Smith is looking at a
maximum sentence of 40 years if convicted in New Jersey State Court. The
immense differences in punishment illustrate a large rift in perceptions over
the seriousness of computer viruses.</p>

<h3>Lack of Metrics</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps one of the reasons that there are so many different
opinions on the effectiveness of legislation is that little quantitative data
has been gathered. How does one go about measuring the effectiveness of a law?
While it is tempting to simply measure the number of arrests as a function of
time and law, this is not a good approach given the small number of virus
writers who have been arrested and tried. Indeed, this lack of arrests is one
of the primary indicators used by some to argue that laws are not a good
deterrent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the ways in which we can judge the efficacy of law as
a deterrent is the overall view of society toward the acts which have been
criminalized (<span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Bagaric, 1999)</span>.
However, we must be careful not to impose our view of the act on others when
attempting to use the criminalization as a “proof” that the act is “wrong”. For
example, the use of marijuana is a criminal offense in some places/situations;
in others, it is a misdemeanor, and in yet others, it is an acceptable
act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<h3>New Metrics and Research Techniques</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As virus writing is a relatively infrequent “crime”, a
better measure of efficacy might be to study the number of times this “crime”
has resulted in viruses let loose into the user community. However, how shall
we define this output of “crime”? While it is true that in practical terms, a
measure of the virus problem can be derived from the infection rate per 1000
PCs, this figure is affected by far more than just the number or activity of
virus writers. New types of virus, a virus “getting lucky”, or simply press
coverage for a well-known virus can skew this number. Similarly, the total
number of known viruses is not necessarily a good indicator, as this number is
somewhat artificial in its creation. Thus, we propose the following new metrics
for measuring, albeit indirectly, the efficacy of legislation with respect to
the virus “problem”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One possible way of measuring the prophylactic effect of
laws is obvious: ask! Based upon previous research, we have built a reliable
and open dialogue with many of today’s more visible virus writers. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>As this “known” population is relatively small (but has a
large impact on many developments in the virus world) a directed survey was
created and administered. Questions (shown in the results section) were
initially distributed via electronic mail and in-person sessions to virus
writers in North and South America, Asia, Europe and Australia. The
questionnaire was also posted to the Usenet News Group alt.comp.virus. The
theory is that by re-administering the questionnaire after a high-profile
criminal case concerning viruses, any suppression in the tendency to write
viruses could be documented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>Unfortunately, the sentencing of David Smith has been
delayed several times, so at this time the administration of the post-test
questions and analysis of that data is not possible. Following the sentencing
of David Smith, the post-test will be administered and the results posted on
the online version of this paper<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
One drawback with this approach is that we expect some virus writers to become
more socially aware as they “age out”; thus a significant delay between
administering the two tests could make the results difficult to interpret for
individual subjects. However, the average population should remain reasonably
static, making the test a possible metric for evaluation of effectiveness of
laws.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>As intimated above, the full measure of the scope of the
virus “problem” itself is extremely hard to measure. How “bad” is the
“problem”? Can it be measured by the number of known viruses on a particular
date? The number of viruses encountered “In the Wild”? The infection rate per
1000 PCs? </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>The answer to this question depends partly on perspective
and partly on the need for the measurement. For example, from the perspective
of the anti-virus researcher working in a non-automated environment, the scope
of the problem is probably based upon the sheer number of viruses, as he must
deal daily with all incoming virus, analyzing, meticulously naming and
prioritizing them, creating cures, etc. For the researcher in an automated
environment, the measurement is likely to be those viruses which cannot be
handled automatically and which she must deal with manually. For the end user,
the infection rate per 1000 PCs in environments which are representative of his
or her own is a vital statistic. However, from the perspective of the
legislator, the scope of the problem is probably related to the sheer number of
problematic viruses - viruses which are highly publicized and brought to his
attention - as this is a direct measure of the number of “illegal” or
“undesirable” acts occurring (not allowing for natural corruption of existing
viruses etc<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></a>). </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>As it seems unlikely that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>writing </i>a virus that never ever is distributed would be made
illegal in The United States, we propose that a suitable measure of the problem
for a legislator is the number of viruses found “in the wild”. Thus, it might
be interesting to correlate the rate of change of the number of new viruses in
the wild with high-profile prosecutions of virus writers. To this end, we have
charted viruses “in the wild” as a function of time. If a noticeable decrease
in the number of new ITW viruses is observed following an arrest/sentencing,
the case could be made that the trials were helping the overall computer user
population. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>Another metric for the efficacy of laws is the
availability of viruses on the WWW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
performed an in-depth analysis using one popular search engine, with the
keyword of “virii”, as a way of locating web sites that appeared to have content
bearing further analysis. Once again, if the number of “virus exchange” web
sites (sites containing live viruses or viral source code) could be shown to
decrease with new legislation/prosecution, there would be evidence for the
effectiveness of the current legislative attempts at controlling the spread of
computer viruses.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, there is the question of a possible backlash
against legislation outlawing the development and distribution of computer
viruses. As tracing a virus author is extremely difficult <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>if </i>the virus writer takes adequate precautions against a possible
investigation, there is a possibility of a backlash against any legislation
which a person or group deems unconstitutional or as an infringement.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>To this end, a survey was conducted at the 2000 DEFCON
conference held in Las Vegas. The conference, attended by many “white hat and
black hat hackers” represents an important part of the computer security
“counter culture”, and in many ways attracts the exact group that laws against
virus writing would be aimed at. <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>We
selected people randomly as they entered the conference foyer<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
To help ensure people could understand the survey questions, and answer
coherently, the selection was done on the first day of the Conference, early in
the day, in order to sample people before they were intoxicated. </span></p>

elevators in American translation) in HK, and lifts have signs saying the
penalty is HK$5000. However, I often enter a lift and smell cigarette smoke,
and I have never seen or heard of someone being fined. The chance of getting
caught is (virtually) nil, so the heavy fine is no deterrent. If the fine was
HK$100, but offenders were caught 50%+ of the time, the practice would quickly
stop. Very few virus writers or distributors have been caught, so the severity
of punishment is small deterrent.</i>” (Dyer, 2000)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This data shows an interesting cross section of views from
both the anti-virus community and the Virus Writer/vX community. Interestingly,
the vX community seems less convinced that laws will help the situation. This
position does not appear to be based upon a vested interest in the
unsuitability of laws, but a genuine feeling within the community that
legislation will not be an effective preventative.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps the most cogent summary of this logic comes from
(Dyer, 2000) quoted in response to Question 4, “Will the arrest and sentencing
of David Smith have any long-term impact?”: if the law will not be enforced or
is unenforceable, it has little effect regardless of the penalties. </p>

<h3>The Number of Viruses In The Wild</h3>

</v:rect>As described above in the section <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New

could be used as a metric of the efficacy of laws. In particular, we are
interested in any discontinuity noted in the graph of viruses both newly ItW
and also on the total number of viruses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><v:rect id="_x0000_s1589" style='position:absolute;

Before analysis can take place, the following descriptors should be
made clear. The x-axis on the graph represents months of the WildList. The top
(red) line represents the total number of viruses on the WildList, and the
middle (green) line is those viruses reported by two or more reporters.
Finally, the bottom (blue) line represents the rate of addition of new viruses
per month. [Note that this information was only tracked from month January
1996, and so before this time the value is set to zero.]<sup><o:p></o:p></sup></p>
<p>

 o:allowincell="f" strokeweight="0"/>The large discontinuity in the first two
lines around January 1999 is an artifact of the change in methodology in the
reporting structure of the Wildlist which resulted in a significant cleaning of
the Wildlist data; rules concerning how long a virus must go unreported before
being dropped from the list were enforced, leading to a significant drop in the
total number of viruses listed. Note no corresponding discontinuity in the
lower line; this is due to the fact that the corrections were not related to
the rate of addition of new viruses, merely the renormalization of those
already reported. </p>

<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>As the most interesting, and arguably most relevant, data is
the rate of new viruses becoming prevalent ItW, Figure 2 shows a detail of this
data: On this graph, we have added stars to note prominent virus/trojan

As can be seen, the graph presents no clear evidence of any suppression in the
rate new viruses were added to the Wildlist. While it can be argued that the
data is (a) noisy (b) made up of more than one factor (that is, perhaps if
there were no prosecutions, the graph would show a much-increased gradient) (c)
lagging behind of real-world events due to the time it takes for a
newly-released virus to spread and reporting cycles, one must also agree that
the Wildlist data <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>provides no evidence to
indicate that these high profile cases and prosecutions have helped depress the
virus problem as measured by the rate of addition of new viruses in the wild. <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>As this paper represents a snapshot of ongoing research
and data gathering, not all the results have yet been gathered. One important
metric proposed in the proceeding section was to measure the availability of
computer viruses on the WWW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In order
to do this, we measured the number of hits generated upon searching for the
word “virii”, using the Google™ search engine<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12'
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
We examined each site to see if it offered viruses. The following results were
noted:</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>On March 15, 2000 Google results netted 5080 for “virii”. A
manual examination of the first 1000 hits netted 65 sites with viruses (in
executable or source code form) available for download. This means that
approximately 6.5% of those sites surveyed contained live viruses or source
code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>On August 18, 2000, Google results netted 20,600 results for
“virii”. An examination of the first 360 hits showed 102 sites with viruses (in
executable or source form). This means that 28% of the sites surveyed contained
viruses; a significant increase over the first data set. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>It should be noted that the interesting figure in this
experiment is <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>not </b>the total number
of hits, but the percentage of those hits which contain viruses. As can be seen
from the results, the percentage of sites which contain the word “virii” that
also have live viruses has increased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While some optimization in search ordering may be responsible for this
increase, this change in percentage is not likely to be due to a simple
increase in the number of sites surveyed. Thus, this test does not show any
convincing evidence for a decrease in the availability of computer viruses – if
anything, viruses are more readily available now than ever before. After the
sentencing of Smith, it will be interesting to note any effect on these
figures.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>One interesting by-product of the research was that some
web authors noted that laws (or more correctly, fear of legal consequences)
have certainly suppressed the dissemination of virus samples from some of the
sites. Here are some examples of verbiage used on some of the sites:</p>

<h3>DEFCON Survey Data</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A survey regarding reactions to proposed virus-writing
legislation was also conducted. In this portion of the study, we chose the
population of attendees at DEFCON (www.defcon.org)<span style='layout-grid-mode:
line'>, and asked two questions (The exact questionnaire is reproduced in
Appendix A; however, the questions were posed verbally using the document as a
reference):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l9 level1 lfo2;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]>If
virus writing were to be made illegal, would that make you less likely to write
a virus (noted as Group 1); more likely to write a virus (noted as Group 3); or
make no difference to your likelihood of writing a virus (noted as Group 2)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l9 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]>Given
that what a person thinks is generally viewed as their own business, and that
intentionally going out to cause someone problems with a virus by intentionally
infecting their computer is viewed as “not ok”, where on this scale of “how far
would you go” do <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>you </b>personally draw
the line at acceptable behaviour? </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Then, we presented ordinally scaled actions ranging from
those that would be almost universally accepted as right/okay, to an action
that was almost universally accepted as wrong<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13'
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></span></span></a>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The resulting data is presented below as a
set of histograms.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal><v:rect id="_x0000_s1066" style='position:absolute;
 margin-left:153.2pt;margin-top:153.4pt;width:172.8pt;height:14.4pt;z-index:6;
 mso-position-horizontal-relative:text;mso-position-vertical-relative:text'
 o:allowincell="f" strokecolor="white"/>There are several different levels of
analysis that can be performed on these data. At the simplest level, we can
examine the data related to the first question: what was the stated effect of
proposed laws. Interestingly, it seems that there is a significant set of
people who claim that the criminalization of virus writing would encourage them
to write computer viruses. Based upon verbal comments by the respondents, this
was primarily due to their feeling that such a law would unfairly restrict
their free speech. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Next, one can examine whether there is any correlation
between the first answer and the second; that is, if we group the sample set
based upon their reaction to laws, does one group appear more ethically
developed than the other? Calculating the sample mean and standard deviation
from each of the groups, we see that it is difficult to show any significant
differences on the samples answers to question II based upon group. This is partly
due to the fact that the data is clearly not normally distributed, although a
visual analysis of the data does also tend to show a strong relation between
the different groups.</p>
<p>

<img src="VB2000SG_files/fig6.gif" alt="The effect of laws">

<p class=MsoCaption><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Figure
<span style='mso-field-code:"SEQ Figure \\* ARABIC"'>6</span>: The effect of
laws</span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:
normal'>. Respondents were grouped depending on answer: those who would be
deterred by laws (Group_01), those for whom laws made no difference (Group_02),
and those who would be incited to write viruses by a new law (Group_03). Thus,
new laws may cause an increase in the number of computer virus writers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that individuals with a low tolerance for virus
exchange in general expressed that proposed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>legislation against virus <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>writing </i>would
make it more likely they would write a virus is interesting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>It would be interesting to compare this data with that from
students in a computer science course, in order to get some measure of the
another population. However, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ad hoc </i>studies
conducted by the author within such environments, at least the reaction to
proposed new laws appears to be similar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, it is interesting to note that some individuals
mentioned that letting a virus you have written out of your own personal
control accidentally was much more wrong than giving that virus to a friend;
“stupidity” was cited as more wrong than intentional distribution.</p>
<p>
<h3>Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research</h3>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The focus of this research has been to gauge the impact
of legal and high-profile intervention to the problem of damage caused by
computer viruses. The data has shown that laws are of some limited effect in
certain sections of the population, but that there could be a backlash in the
United States to a law that was viewed to be a violation of an individual’s
rights to speech. While the free speech question as it pertains to computer
viruses is unclear, this is immaterial: the key issue is that there are certain
segments of the computing population within the United States who would <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>view </i>such a law to be unconstitutional,
and state they would act accordingly. Further research on the likelihood of
follow-through on electronic civil disobedience would appear to be an important
next step in assessing the impact of legislation directly aimed at virus
writing. Additionally, as the virus writing subculture is an international
population, civil-disobedience and activism crossover between populations with
laws and without laws bears further investigation. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>A comparison of the number of viruses in the wild to
high-profile virus writer cases/actions does not show any clear correlation
with a decrease in the creation of new viruses. Indeed, despite much effort,
the rate of addition of new viruses to the WildList appears to be increasing.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>Tests and assessments should never be interpreted in
isolation; thus, considering the strength of the responses can be as important
in seeing the overall picture as the consideration of the statistical data.
Additionally, this “strength of conviction” must be considered alongside the
worldview of the population. Consider that any laws created/enforced are aimed
at a very small, but active virus writing community; the strength of conviction
related to the DEFCON data seems to indicate that the creation of such laws
would actually create more new virus writers than deter existing ones. This,
coupled with the relative unenforceability of such laws could lead to a
situation that is actually worse than the one we have currently. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>Thus, examining all the data currently available, we are
unable to show that the aggressive legislation directed toward, or intervention
related to, virus <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>writers</i> will have
any positive impact on the virus “problem” as defined by a number of different
metrics.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>We await the outcome of the post-sentencing interviews
with interest. If the interviews show a significant change from their pre-sentencing
results, proponents of thorough police follow-up of virus writers will have
some hard data with which to back up their position. Conversely, if there is no
appreciable difference in the data, we must, as a judiciary, re-evaluate the
costs associated with pursuing legal remedies and high-profile “legal”
interventions to a primarily sociological phenomenon. </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoPlainText>Perhaps instead of attempting to raise support for making
virus writing illegal, the energy and associated funds currently being expended
would be better spent on education, with legal action or high profile
intervention reserved for cases where an individual’s clear and direct intent
to damage could be shown.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>An obvious objection to the lack of interventions is, quite
simply, that the virus author should be held responsible for the results of his
creation. After all, whether an infection occurs as the result of direct action
from the virus writer (i.e. the virus is written, and uploaded to a Usenet News
Group, masquerading as a legitimate utility) or is put into circulation via the
WWW (i.e. clearly labeled as a virus on a virus exchange WWW site), the fact
remains: someone created the virus that is responsible for the infection.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The question is what, if any, responsibility
does the creator of the virus hold? </p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In cases where a direct relationship between the virus
author and a crime involving his virus can be shown, adequate existing legal
measures can be applied. However, in cases where a virus author claims a
“right” to make his or her virus freely available, or gives the virus away to
knowing and willing recipients, but does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
directly cause an infection, should we assume the question of responsibility
dissipates?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Opinions on the degree of
responsibility vary, but one respondent’s comments on this issue bear further
examination:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>“<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Shouldn’t they really know by now that these things can cause problems
whether they mean for them to or not!?</i>”</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, in many cases we continue to see a typical
pattern of older virus writers “aging out”, while a new, inexperienced batch is
still being birthed. By the time a virus writer is of age to know better, and
to recognize the impact of these actions on others, they are already beginning
to disassociate with their virus writing activities. Thus, while in some ways
there is an “end of innocence” by those who realize their mistake, and exit the
field, there is a complete pipeline of new authors just beginning their
exploration. For this reason, it is flawed to simply assume that there is no
innocent in the virus writing world; far from it: there are many.</p>
<p>
<p class=MsoNormal>This innocence and naivete, combined with the rapidly
accelerating growth and evolution of technology, create a problem that is far
more complex than socio-technological problems of the past. Other technologies
that have been hugely influential on our societies have developed relatively
slowly, thus enabling us to keep pace, predict future trends, and impart values
related to those technologies to our young people. Now, however, the technology
upon which we are attempting to base our projections is evolving rapidly. As
the virus writing subculture continues to evolve, we are likely to see an
exacerbation of problems relating to the technologies we are developing. The
real question is how to best deploy our resources to protect us from this
learning process, in which we are all participants.</p>
