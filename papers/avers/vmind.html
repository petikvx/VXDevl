<BLOCKQUOTE>The haven all memes depend on reaching is the human mind, but a
human mind is itself an artifact created when memes restructure a human brain
in order to make it a better habitat for memes. The avenues for entry and
departure are modified to suit local conditions, and strengthened by various
artificial devices that enhance fidelity and prolixity of replication: native
Chinese minds differ dramatically from native French minds, and literate minds
differ from illiterate minds. What memes provide in return to the organisms in
which they reside is an incalculable store of advantages --- with some Trojan
horses thrown in for good measure. . .

<H2>1 Duplication Fodder</H2>

A beautiful child close to me, six and the apple of her father's eye, believes
that Thomas the Tank Engine really exists. She believes in Father Christmas,
and when she grows up her ambition is to be a tooth fairy. She and her
school-friends believe the solemn word of respected adults that tooth fairies
and Father Christmas really exist. This little girl is of an age to believe
whatever you tell her. If you tell her about witches changing princes into
frogs she will believe you. If you tell her that bad children roast forever in
hell she will have nightmares. I have just discovered that without her father's
consent this sweet, trusting, gullible six-year-old is being sent, for weekly
instruction, to a Roman Catholic nun. What chance has she?

<P>A human child is shaped by evolution to soak up the culture of her people.
Most obviously, she learns the essentials of their language in a matter of
months. A large dictionary of words to speak, an encyclopedia of information to
speak about, complicated syntactic and semantic rules to order the speaking,
are all transferred from older brains into hers well before she reaches half
her adult size. When you are pre-programmed to absorb useful information at a
high rate, it is hard to shut out pernicious or damaging information at the
same time. With so many mindbytes to be downloaded, so many mental codons to be
replicated, it is no wonder that child brains are gullible, open to almost any
suggestion, vulnerable to subversion, easy prey to Moonies, Scientologists and
nuns. Like immune-deficient patients, children are wide open to mental
infections that adults might brush off without effort.

<P>DNA, too, includes parasitic code. Cellular machinery is extremely good at
copying DNA. Where DNA is concerned, it seems to have an eagerness to copy,
seems eager to be copied. The cell nucleus is a paradise for DNA, humming with
sophisticated, fast, and accurate duplicating machinery.

<P>Cellular machinery is so friendly towards DNA duplication that it is small
wonder cells play host to DNA parasites --- viruses, viroids, plasmids and a
riff-raff of other genetic fellow travelers. Parasitic DNA even gets itself
spliced seamlessly into the chromosomes themselves. ``Jumping genes'' and
stretches of ``selfish DNA'' cut or copy themselves out of chromosomes and
paste themselves in elsewhere. Deadly oncogenes are almost impossible to
distinguish from the legitimate genes between which they are spliced.  In
evolutionary time, there is probably a continual traffic from ``straight''
genes to ``outlaw,'' and back again (Dawkins, 1982). DNA is just DNA. The only
thing that distinguishes viral DNA from host DNA is its expected method of
passing into future generations. ``Legitimate'' host DNA is just DNA that
aspires to pass into the next generation via the orthodox route of sperm or
egg. ``Outlaw'' or parasitic DNA is just DNA that looks to a quicker, less
cooperative route to the future, via a squeezed droplet or a smear of blood,
rather than via a sperm or egg.

<P>For data on a floppy disc, a computer is a humming paradise just as cell
nuclei hum with eagerness to duplicate DNA. Computers and their associated disc
and tape readers are designed with high fidelity in mind. As with DNA
molecules, magnetized bytes don't literally ``want'' to be faithfully
copied. Nevertheless, you can write a computer program that takes steps to
duplicate itself. Not just duplicate itself within one computer but spread
itself to other computers. Computers are so good at copying bytes, and so good
at faithfully obeying the instructions contained in those bytes, that they are
sitting ducks to self-replicating programs: wide open to subversion by software
parasites. Any cynic familiar with the theory of selfish genes and memes would
have known that modern personal computers, with their promiscuous traffic of
floppy discs and e-mail links, were just asking for trouble. The only
surprising thing about the current epidemic of computer viruses is that it has
been so long in coming.

<H2>2 Computer Viruses: a Model for an Informational Epidemiology</H2>

Computer viruses are pieces of code that graft themselves into existing,
legitimate programs and subvert the normal actions of those programs. They may
travel on exchanged floppy disks, or over networks. They are technically
distinguished from ``worms'' which are whole programs in their own right,
usually traveling over networks. Rather different are ``Trojan horses,'' a
third category of destructive programs, which are not in themselves
self-replicating but rely on humans to replicate them because of their
pornographic or otherwise appealing content. Both viruses and worms are
programs that actually say, in computer language, ``Duplicate me.'' Both may do
other things that make their presence felt and perhaps satisfy the
hole-in-corner vanity of their authors. These side-effects may be ``humorous''
(like the virus that makes the Macintosh's built-in loudspeaker enunciate the
words ``Don't panic,'' with predictably opposite effect); malicious (like the
numerous IBM viruses that erase the hard disk after a sniggering
screen-announcement of the impending disaster); political (like the Spanish
Telecom and Beijing viruses that protest about telephone costs and massacred
students respectively); or simply inadvertent (the programmer is incompetent to
handle the low-level system calls required to write an effective virus or
worm). The famous Internet Worm, which paralyzed much of the computing power of
the United States on November 2, 1988, was not intended (very) maliciously but
got out of control and, within 24 hours, had clogged around 6,000 computer
memories with exponentially multiplying copies of itself.

<P>``Memes now spread around the world at the speed of light, and replicate at
rates that make even fruit flies and yeast cells look glacial in comparison.
They leap promiscuously from vehicle to vehicle, and from medium to medium, and
are proving to be virtually unquarantinable'' (Dennett 1990, p.131).  Viruses
aren't limited to electronic media such as disks and data lines.  On its way
from one computer to another, a virus may pass through printing ink, light rays
in a human lens, optic nerve impulses and finger muscle contractions. A
computer fanciers' magazine that printed the text of a virus program for the
interest of its readers has been widely condemned.  Indeed, such is the appeal
of the virus idea to a certain kind of puerile mentality (the masculine gender
is used advisedly), that publication of any kind of ``how to'' information on
designing virus programs is rightly seen as an irresponsible act.

<P>I am not going to publish any virus code. But there are certain tricks of
effective virus design that are sufficiently well known, even obvious, that it
will do no harm to mention them, as I need to do to develop my theme. They all
stem from the virus's need to evade detection while it is spreading.

<P>A virus that clones itself too prolifically within one computer will soon be
detected because the symptoms of clogging will become too obvious to
ignore. For this reason many virus programs check, before infecting a system,
to make sure that they are not already on that system. Incidentally, this opens
the way for a defense against viruses that is analogous to immunization.  In
the days before a specific anti-virus program was available, I myself responded
to an early infection of my own hard disk by means of a crude ``vaccination.''
Instead of deleting the virus that I had detected, I simply disabled its coded
instructions, leaving the ``shell'' of the virus with its characteristic
external ``signature'' intact. In theory, subsequent members of the same virus
species that arrived in my system should have recognized the signature of their
own kind and refrained from trying to double-infect. I don't know whether this
immunization really worked, but in those days it probably was worth while
``gutting'' a virus and leaving a shell like this, rather than simply removing
it lock, stock and barrel.  Nowadays it is better to hand the problem over to
one of the professionally written anti-virus programs.

<P>A virus that is too virulent will be rapidly detected and scotched.  A virus
that instantly and catastrophically sabotages every computer in which it finds
itself will not find itself in many computers. It may have a most amusing
effect on one computer ---- erase an entire doctoral thesis or something
equally side-splitting --- but it won't spread as an epidemic.

<P>Some viruses, therefore, are designed to have an effect that is small enough
to be difficult to detect, but which may nevertheless be extremely
damaging. There is one type, which, instead of erasing disk sectors wholesale,
attacks only spreadsheets, making a few random changes in the (usually
financial) quantities entered in the rows and columns. Other viruses evade
detection by being triggered probabilistically, for example erasing only one in
16 of the hard disks infected. Yet other viruses employ the time-bomb
principle. Most modern computers are ``aware'' of the date, and viruses have
been triggered to manifest themselves all around the world, on a particular
date such as Friday 13th or April Fool's Day. From the parasitic point of view,
it doesn't matter how catastrophic the eventual attack is, provided the virus
has had plenty of opportunity to spread first (a disturbing analogy to the    
Medawar/Williams theory of ageing: we are the victims of
lethal and sub-lethal genes that mature only after we have had plenty of time
to reproduce (Williams, 1957)).  In defense, some large companies go so far as
to set aside one ``miner's canary'' among their fleet of computers, and advance
its internal calendar a week so that any time-bomb viruses will reveal
themselves prematurely before the big day.

<P>Again predictably, the epidemic of computer viruses has triggered an arms
race. Anti-viral software is doing a roaring trade. These antidote programs --
``Interferon,'' ``Vaccine,'' ``Gatekeeper'' and others --- employ a diverse
armory of tricks. Some are written with specific, known and named viruses in
mind. Others intercept any attempt to meddle with sensitive system areas of
memory and warn the user.

<P>The virus principle could, in theory, be used for non-malicious, even
beneficial purposes. Thimbleby (1991) coins the phrase ``liveware'' for his
already-implemented use of the infection principle for keeping multiple copies
of databases up to date. Every time a disk containing the database is plugged
into a computer, it looks to see whether there is already another copy present
on the local hard disk. If there is, each copy is updated in the light of the
other. So, with a bit of luck, it doesn't matter which member of a circle of
colleagues enters, say, a new bibliographical citation on his personal
disk. His newly entered information will readily infect the disks of his
colleagues (because the colleagues promiscuously insert their disks into one
another's computers) and will spread like an epidemic around the
circle. Thimbleby's liveware is not entirely virus-like: it could not spread to
just anybody's computer and do damage. It spreads data only to already-existing
copies of its own database; and you will not be infected by liveware unless you
positively opt for infection.

<P>Incidentally, Thimbleby, who is much concerned with the virus menace, points
out that you can gain some protection by using computer systems that other
people don't use. The usual justification for purchasing today's numerically
dominant computer is simply and solely that it <em>is</em> numerically
dominant. Almost every knowledgeable person agrees that, in terms of quality
and especially user-friendliness, the rival, minority system is superior.
Nevertheless, ubiquity is held to be good in itself, sufficient to outweigh
sheer quality. Buy the same (albeit inferior) computer as your colleagues, the
argument goes, and you'll be able to benefit from shared software, and from a
generally large circulation of available software. The irony is that, with the
advent of the virus plague, ``benefit'' is not all that you are likely to
get. Not only should we all be very hesitant before we accept a disk from a
colleague. We should also be aware that, if we join a large community of users
of a particular make of computer, we are also joining a large community of
viruses --- even, it turns out, <em>disproportionately</em> larger.

<P>Returning to possible uses of viruses for positive purposes, there are
proposals to exploit the ``poacher turned gamekeeper'' principle, and ``set a
thief to catch a thief.'' A simple way would be to take any of the existing
anti-viral programs and load it, as a ``warhead,'' into a harmless
self-replicating virus. From a ``public health'' point of view, a spreading
epidemic of anti-viral software could be especially beneficial because the
computers most vulnerable to malicious viruses --- those whose owners are
promiscuous in the exchange of pirated programs --- will also be most
vulnerable to infection by the healing anti-virus. A more penetrating
anti-virus might --- as in the immune system --- ``learn'' or ``evolve'' an
improved capacity to attack whatever viruses it encountered.

<P>I can imagine other uses of the computer virus principle which, if not
exactly altruistic, are at least constructive enough to escape the charge of
pure vandalism. A computer company might wish to do market research on the
habits of its customers, with a view to improving the design of future
products. Do users like to choose files by pictorial icon, or do they opt to
display them by textual name only? How deeply do people nest folders
(directories) within one another? Do people settle down for a long session with
only one program, say a word processors, or are they constantly switching back
and forth, say between writing and drawing programs? Do people succeed in
moving the mouse pointer straight to the target, or do they meander around in
time-wasting hunting movements that could be rectified by a change in design?

<P>The company could send out a questionnaire asking all these questions, but
the customers that replied would be a biased sample and, in any case, their own
assessment of their computer-using behavior might be inaccurate.  A better
solution would be a market-research computer program. Customers would be asked
to load this program into their system where it would unobtrusively sit,
quietly monitoring and tallying key-presses and mouse movements. At the end of
a year, the customer would be asked to send in the disk file containing all the
tallyings of the market-research program. But again, most people would not
bother to cooperate and some might see it as an invasion of privacy and of
their disk space.

<P>The perfect solution, from the company's point of view, would be a virus.
Like any other virus, it would be self-replicating and secretive. But it would
not be destructive or facetious like an ordinary virus. Along with its
self-replicating booster it would contain a market-research warhead.  The virus
would be released surreptitiously into the community of computer users. Just
like an ordinary virus it would spread around, as people passed floppy disks
and e-mail around the community. As the virus spread from computer to computer,
it would build up statistics on users behavior, monitored secretly from deep
within a succession of systems. Every now and again, a copy of the viruses
would happen to find its way, by normal epidemic traffic, back into one of the
company's own computers. There it would be debriefed and its data collated with
data from other copies of the virus that had come ``home.''

<P>Looking into the future, it is not fanciful to imagine a time when viruses,
both bad and good, have become so ubiquitous that we could speak of an
ecological community of viruses and legitimate programs coexisting in the
silicosphere. At present, software is advertised as, say, ``Compatible with
System 7.'' In the future, products may be advertised as ``Compatible with all
viruses registered in the 1998 World Virus Census; immune to all listed
virulent viruses; takes full advantage of the facilities offered by the
following benign viruses if present...'' Word-processing software, say, may
hand over particular functions, such as word-counting and string-searches, to
friendly viruses burrowing autonomously through the text.

<P>Looking even further into the future, whole integrated software systems
might grow, not by design, but by something like the growth of an ecological
community such as a tropical rain-forest. Gangs of mutually compatible viruses
might grow up, in the same way as genomes can be regarded as gangs of mutually
compatible genes (Dawkins, 1982). Indeed, I have even suggested that our
genomes should be regarded as gigantic colonies of viruses (Dawkins,
1976). Genes cooperate with one another in genomes because natural selection
has favored those genes that prosper in the presence of the other genes that
happen to be common in the gene pool. Different gene pools may evolve towards
different combinations of mutually compatible genes. I envisage a time when, in
the same kind of way, computer viruses may evolve towards compatibility with
other viruses, to form communities or gangs. But then again, perhaps not! At
any rate, I find the speculation more alarming than exciting.

<P>At present, computer viruses don't strictly evolve. They are invented by
human programmers, and if they evolve they do so in the same weak sense as cars
or aeroplanes evolve. Designers derive this year's car as a slight modification
of last year's car, and then may, more or less consciously, continue a trend of
the last few years --- further flattening of the radiator grill or whatever it
may be. Computer virus designers dream up ever more devious tricks for
outwitting the programmers of anti-virus software. But computer viruses don't
--- so far --- mutate and evolve by true natural selection. They may do so in
the future. Whether they evolve by natural selection, or whether their
evolution is steered by human designers, may not make much difference to their
eventual performance. By either kind of evolution, we expect them to become
better at concealment, and we expect them to become subtly compatible with
other viruses that are at the same time prospering in the computer community.

<P>DNA viruses and computer viruses spread for the same reason: an environment
exists in which there is machinery well set up to duplicate and spread them
around and to obey the instructions that the viruses embody. These two
environments are, respectively, the environment of cellular physiology and the
environment provided by a large community of computers and data-handling
machinery. Are there any other environments like these, any other humming
paradises of replication?

<H2>3 The Infected Mind</H2>

I have already alluded to the programmed-in gullibility of a child, so useful
for learning language and traditional wisdom, and so easily subverted by nuns,
Moonies and their ilk. More generally, we all exchange information with one
another. We don't exactly plug floppy disks into slots in one another's skulls,
but we exchange sentences, both through our ears and through our eyes. We
notice each other's styles of moving and dressing and are influenced. We take
in advertising jingles, and are presumably persuaded by them, otherwise
hard-headed businessmen would not spend so much money polluting their air with
them.

<P>Think about the two qualities that a virus, or any sort of parasitic
replicator, demands of a friendly medium,. the two qualities that make cellular
machinery so friendly towards parasitic DNA, and that make computers so
friendly towards computer viruses. These qualities are, firstly, a readiness to
replicate information accurately, perhaps with some mistakes that are
subsequently reproduced accurately; and, secondly, a readiness to obey
instructions encoded in the information so replicated.

<P>Cellular machinery and electronic computers excel in both these
virus-friendly qualities. How do human brains match up? As faithful
duplicators, they are certainly less perfect than either cells or electronic
computers. Nevertheless, they are still pretty good, perhaps about as faithful
as an RNA virus, though not as good as DNA with all its elaborate proofreading
measures against textual degradation. Evidence of the fidelity of brains,
especially child brains, as data duplicators is provided by language
itself. Shaw's Professor Higgins was able by ear alone to place Londoners in
the street where they grew up. Fiction is not evidence for anything, but
everyone knows that Higgins's fictional skill is only an exaggeration of
something we can all down. Any American can tell Deep South from Mid West, New
England from Hillbilly. Any New Yorker can tell Bronx from Brooklyn. Equivalent
claims could be substantiated for any country. What this phenomenon means is
that human brains are capable of pretty accurate copying (otherwise the accents
of, say, Newcastle would not be stable enough to be recognized) but with some
mistakes (otherwise pronunciation would not evolve, and all speakers of a
language would inherit identically the same accents from their remote
ancestors). Language evolves, because it has both the great stability and the
slight changeability that are prerequisites for any evolving system.

<P>The second requirement of a virus-friendly environment --- that it should
obey a program of coded instructions --- is again only quantitatively less true
for brains than for cells or computers. We sometimes obey orders from one
another, but also we sometimes don't. Nevertheless, it is a telling fact that,
the world over, the vast majority of children follow the religion of their
parents rather than any of the other available religions. Instructions to
genuflect, to bow towards Mecca, to nod one's head rhythmically towards the
wall, to shake like a maniac, to ``speak in tongues'' --- the list of such
arbitrary and pointless motor patterns offered by religion alone is extensive
--- are obeyed, if not slavishly, at least with some reasonably high
statistical probability.

<P>Less portentously, and again especially prominent in children, the ``craze''
is a striking example of behavior that owes more to epidemiology than to
rational choice. Yo-yos, hula hoops and pogo sticks, with their associated
behavioral fixed actions, sweep through schools, and more sporadically leap
from school to school, in patterns that differ from a measles epidemic in no
serious particular. Ten years ago, you could have traveled thousands of miles
through the United States and never seen a baseball cap turned back to
front. Today, the reverse baseball cap is ubiquitous. I do not know what the
pattern of geographical spread of the reverse baseball cap precisely was, but
epidemiology is certainly among the professions primarily qualified to study
it. We don't have to get into arguments about ``determinism''; we don't have to
claim that children are compelled to imitate their fellows' hat fashions. It is
enough that their hat-wearing behavior, as a matter of fact, <em>is</em>
statistically affected by the hat-wearing behavior of their fellows.

<P>Trivial though they are, crazes provide us with yet more circumstantial
evidence that human minds, especially perhaps juvenile ones, have the qualities
that we have singled out as desirable for an informational parasite. At the
very least the mind is a plausible <em>candidate</em> for infection by
something like a computer virus, even if it is not quite such a parasite's
dream-environment as a cell nucleus or an electronic computer.

<P>It is intriguing to wonder what it might feel like, from the inside, if
one's mind were the victim of a ``virus.'' This might be a deliberately
designed parasite, like a present-day computer virus. Or it might be an
inadvertently mutated and unconsciously evolved parasite. Either way,
especially if the evolved parasite was the memic descendant of a long line of
successful ancestors, we are entitled to expect the typical ``mind virus'' to
be pretty good at its job of getting itself successfully replicated.

<P>Progressive evolution of more effective mind-parasites will have two
aspects. New ``mutants'' (either random or designed by humans) that are better
at spreading will become more numerous. And there will be a ganging up of ideas
that flourish in one another's presence, ideas that mutually support one
another just as genes do and as I have speculated computer viruses may one day
do. We expect that replicators will go around together from brain to brain in
mutually compatible gangs. These gangs will come to constitute a package, which
may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman
Catholicism or Voodoo. It doesn't too much matter whether we analogize the
whole package to a single virus, to each one of the component parts to a single
virus. The analogy is not that precise anyway, just as the distinction between
a computer virus and a computer worm is nothing to get worked up about. What
matters is that minds are friendly environments to parasitic, self-replicating
ideas or information, and that minds are typically massively infected.

<P>Like computer viruses, successful mind viruses will tend to be hard for
their victims to detect. If you are the victim of one, the chances are that you
won't know it, and may even vigorously deny it. Accepting that a virus might be
difficult to detect in your own mind, what tell-tale signs might you look out
for? I shall answer by imaging how a medical textbook might describe the
typical symptoms of a sufferer (arbitrarily assumed to be male).

<P><strong>1.</strong> The patient typically finds himself impelled by some
deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a
conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to evidence or reason, but which,
nevertheless, he feels as totally compelling and convincing. We doctors refer
to such a belief as ``faith.''

<P><strong>2.</strong> Patients typically make a positive virtue of faith's
being strong and unshakable, <em>in spite of</em> not being based upon
evidence.  Indeed, they may fell that the less evidence there is, the more
virtuous the belief (see below).

<P>This paradoxical idea that lack of evidence is a positive virtue where faith
is concerned has something of the quality of a program that is self-sustaining,
because it is self-referential (see the chapter ``On Viral Sentences and
Self-Replicating Structures'' in Hofstadter, 1985). Once the proposition is
believed, it automatically undermines opposition to itself. The ``lack of
evidence is a virtue'' idea could be an admirable sidekick, ganging up with
faith itself in a clique of mutually supportive viral programs.

<P><strong>3.</strong> A related symptom, which a faith-sufferer may also
present, is the conviction that ``mystery,'' <em>per se,</em> is a good
thing. It is not a virtue to solve mysteries. Rather we should enjoy them, even
revel in their insolubility.

<P>Any impulse to solve mysteries could be serious inimical to the spread of a
mind virus. It would not, therefore, be surprising if the idea that ``mysteries
are better not solved'' was a favored member of a mutually supporting gang of
viruses. Take the ``Mystery of Transubstantiation.''  It is easy and
non-mysterious to believe that in some symbolic or metaphorical sense the
eucharistic wine turns into the blood of Christ. The Roman Catholic doctrine of
transubstantiation, however, claims far more. The ``whole substance'' of the
wine is converted into the blood of Christ; the appearance of wine that remains
is ``merely accidental,'' ``inhering in no substance'' (Kenny, 1986,
p. 72). Transubstantiation is colloquially taught as meaning that the wine
``literally'' turns into the blood of Christ. Whether in its obfuscatory
Aristotelian or its franker colloquial form, the claim of transubstantiation
can be made only if we do serious violence to the normal meanings of words like
``substance'' and ``literally.'' Redefining words is not a sin, but, if we use
words like ``whole substance'' and ``literally'' for this case, what word are
we going to use when we really and truly <em>want</em> to say that something
did actually happen? As Anthony Kenny observed of his own puzzlement as a young
seminarian, ``For all I could tell, my typewriter might be Benjamin Disraeli
transubstantiated....''

<P>Roman Catholics, whose belief in infallible authority compels them to accept
that wine becomes physically transformed into blood despite all appearances,
refer to the ``mystery'' of transubstantiation. Calling it a mystery makes
everything OK, you see. At least, it works for a mind well prepared by
background infection. Exactly the same trick is performed in the ``mystery'' of
the Trinity. Mysteries are not meant to be solved, they are meant to strike
awe. The ``mystery is a virtue'' idea comes to the aid of the Catholic, who
would otherwise find intolerable the obligation to believe the obvious nonsense
of the transubstantiation and the ``three-in-one.''  Again, the belief that
``mystery is a virtue'' has a self-referential ring.  As Hofstadter might put
it, the very mysteriousness of the belief moves the believer to perpetuate the
mystery.

<P>An extreme symptom of ``mystery is a virtue'' infection is Tertullian's
``<em>Certum est quia impossibile est</em>'' (It is certain because it is
impossible''). That way madness lies. One is tempted to quote Lewis Carroll's
White Queen, who, in response to Alice's ``One can't believe impossible
things'' retorted ``I daresay you haven't had much practice... When I was your
age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as
many as six impossible things before breakfast.'' Or Douglas Adam's Electric
Monk, a labor-saving device programmed to do your believing for you, which was
capable of ``believing things they'd have difficulty believing in Salt Lake
City'' and which, at the moment of being introduced to the reader, believed,
contrary to all the evidence, that everything in the world was a uniform shade
of pink. But White Queens and Electric Monks become less funny when you realize
that these virtuoso believers are indistinguishable from revered theologians in
real life. ``It is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd''
(Tertullian again). Sir Thomas Browne (1635) quotes Tertullian with approval,
and goes further: ``Methinks there be not impossibilities enough in religion
for an active faith.'' And ``I desire to exercise my faith in the difficultest
point; for to credit ordinary and visible objects is not faith, but perswasion
[sic].''

<P>I have the feeling that something more interesting is going on here than
just plain insanity or surrealist nonsense, something akin to the admiration we
feel when we watch a ten-ball juggler on a tightrope. It is as though the
faithful gain prestige through managing to believe even more impossible things
than their rivals succeed in believing. Are these people testing --- exercising
--- their believing muscles, training themselves to believe impossible things
so that they can take in their stride the merely improbable things that they
are ordinarily called upon to believe?

<P>While I was writing this, the <cite>Guardian</cite> (July 29, 1991)
fortuitously carried a beautiful example. It came in an interview with a rabbi
undertaking the bizarre task of vetting the kosher-purity of food products
right back to the ultimate origins of their minutest ingredients. He was
currently agonizing over whether to go all the way to China to scrutinize the
menthol that goes into cough sweets. ``Have you ever tried checking Chinese
menthol...  it was extremely difficult, especially since the first letter we
sent received the reply in best Chinese English, `The product contains no
kosher'...  China has only recently started opening up to kosher
investigators. The menthol should be OK, but you can never be absolutely sure
unless you visit.''  These kosher investigators run a telephone hot-line on
which up-to-the-minute red-alerts of suspicion are recorded against chocolate
bars and cod-liver oil. The rabbi sighs that the green-inspired trend away from
artificial colors and flavors ``makes life miserable in the kosher field
because you have to follow all these things back.'' When the interviewer asks
him why he bothers with this obviously pointless exercise, he makes it very
clear that the point is precisely that there <em>is</em> no point:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That most of the Kashrut laws are divine ordinances without reason
given is 100 per cent the point. It is very easy not to murder people. Very
easy.  It is a little bit harder not to steal because one is tempted
occasionally.  So that is no great proof that I believe in God or am fulfilling
His will.  But, if He tells me not to have a cup of coffee with milk in it with
my mincemeat and peaces at lunchtime, that is a test. The only reason I am
doing that is because I have been told to so do. It is something
difficult.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Helena Cronin has suggested to me that there may be an analogy here to
Zahavi's handicap theory of sexual selection and the evolution of signals
(Zahavi, 1975). Long unfashionable, even ridiculed (Dawkins, 1976), Zahavi's
theory has recently been cleverly rehabilitated (Grafen, 1990 a, b) and is now
taken seriously by evolutionary biologists (Dawkins, 1989). Zahavi suggests
that peacocks, for instance, evolve their absurdly burdensome fans with their
ridiculously conspicuous (to predators) colors, precisely <em>because</em> they
are burdensome and dangerous, and therefore impressive to females. The peacock
is, in effect, saying: ``Look how fit and strong I must be, since I can afford
to carry around this preposterous tail.''

<P>To avoid misunderstanding of the subjective language in which Zahavi likes
to make his points, I should add that the biologist's convention of
personifying the unconscious actions of natural selection is taken for granted
here. Grafen has translated the argument into an orthodox Darwinian
mathematical model, and it works. No claim is here being made about the
intentionality or awareness of peacocks and peahens. They can be as sphexish or
as intentional as you please (Dennett, 1983, 1984). Moreover, Zahavi's theory
is general enough not to depend upon a Darwinian underpinning. A flower
advertising its nectar to a ``skeptical'' bee could benefit from the Zahavi
principle. But so could a human salesman seeking to impress a client.

<P>The premise of Zahavi's idea is that natural selection will favor skepticism
among females (or among recipients of advertising messages generally).  The
only way for a male (or any advertiser) to authenticate his boast of strength
(quality, or whatever is is) is to prove that it is true by shouldering a truly
costly handicap --- a handicap <em>that only a genuinely strong</em> (high
quality, etc.) male could bear. It may be called the principle of costly
authentication. And now to the point. Is it possible that some religious
doctrines are favored not <em>in spite of</em> being ridiculous but precisely
<em>because</em> they are ridiculous? Any wimp in religion could believe that
bread <em>symbolically</em> represents the body of Christ, but it takes a real,
red-blooded Catholic to believe something as daft as the transubstantiation.
If you believe that you can believe anything, and (witness the story of
Doubting Thomas) these people are trained to see that as a virtue.

<P>Let us return to our list of symptoms that someone afflicted with the mental
virus of faith, and its accompanying gang of secondary infections, may expect
to experience.

<P><strong>4.</strong> The sufferer may find himself behaving intolerantly
towards vectors of rival faiths, in extreme cases even killing them or
advocating their deaths. He may be similarly violent in his disposition towards
apostates (people who once held the faith but have renounced it); or towards
heretics (people who espouse a different --- often, perhaps significantly, only
very slightly different --- version of the faith). He may also feel hostile
towards other modes of thought that are potentially inimical to his faith, such
as the method of scientific reason which may function rather like a piece of
anti-viral software.

<P>The threat to kill the distinguished novelist Salman Rushdie is only the
latest in a long line of sad examples. On the very day that I wrote this, the
Japanese translator of <cite>The Satanic Verses</cite> was found murdered, a
week after a near-fatal attack on the Italian translator of the same book. By
the way, the apparently opposite symptom of ``sympathy'' for Muslim ``hurt,''
voiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other Christian leaders (verging, in
the case of the Vatican, on outright criminal complicity) is, of course, a
manifestation of the symptom we discussed earlier: the delusion that faith,
however obnoxious its results, has to be respected simply because it
<em>is</em> faith.

<P>Murder is an extreme, of course. But there is an even more extreme symptom,
and that is suicide in the militant service of a faith. Like a soldier ant
programmed to sacrifice her life for germ-line copies of the genes that did the
programming, a young Arab or Japanese [??!] is taught that to die in a holy war
is the quickest way to heaven. Whether the leaders who exploit him really
believe this does not diminish the brutal power that the ``suicide mission
virus'' wields on behalf of the faith. Of course suicide, like murder, is a
mixed blessing: would-be converts may be repelled, or may treat with contempt a
faith that is perceived as insecure enough to need such tactics.

<P>More obviously, if too many individuals sacrifice themselves the supply of
believers could run low. This was true of a notorious example of faith-inspired
suicide, though in this case it was not ``kamikaze'' death in battle. The
Peoples' Temple sect became extinct when its leader, the Reverend Jim Jones,
led the bulk of his followers from the United States to the Promised Land of
``Jonestown'' in the Guyanan jungle where he persuaded more than 900 of them,
children first, to drink cyanide. The macabre affair was fully investigated by
a team from the <cite>San Francisco Chronicle</cite> (Kilduff and Javers,
1978).

<BLOCKQUOTE>Jones, ``the Father,'' had called his flock together and told them
it was time to depart for heaven. <BR>
	``We're going to meet,'' he promised, ``in another place.'' <BR>
	The words kept coming over the camp's loudspeakers. <BR>
	``There is great dignity in dying. It is a great demonstration for
everyone to die.'' </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Incidentally, it does not escape the trained mind of the alert
sociobiologist that Jones, within his sect in earlier days, ``proclaimed
himself the only person permitted to have sex'' (presumably his partners were
also permitted).  ``A secretary would arrange for Jones's liaisons. She would
call up and say, `Father hates to do this, but he has this tremendous urge and
could you please...?' '' His victims were not only female. One 17-year-old male
follower, from the days when Jones's community was still in San Francisco, told
how he was taken for dirty weekends to a hotel where Jones received a
``minister's discount for Rev. Jim Jones and son.'' The same boy said: ``I was
really in awe of him. He was more than a father. I would have killed my parents
for him.'' What is remarkable about the Reverend Jim Jones is not his own
self-serving behavior but the almost superhuman gullibility of his
followers. Given such prodigious credulity, can anyone doubt that human minds
are ripe for malignant infection?

<P>Admittedly, the Reverend Jones conned only a few thousand people. But his
case is an extreme, the tip of an iceberg. The same eagerness to be conned by
religious leaders is widespread. Most of us would have been prepared to bet
that nobody could get away with going on television and saying, in all but so
many words, ``Send me your money, so that I can use it to persuade other
suckers to send me their money too.'' Yet today, in every major conurbation in
the United States, you can find at least one television evangelist channel
entirely devoted to this transparent confidence trick.  And they get away with
it in sackfuls. Faced with suckerdom on this awesome scale, it is hard not to
feel a grudging sympathy with the shiny-suited conmen. Until you realize that
not all the suckers are rich, and that it is often widows' mites on which the
evangelists are growing fat. I have even heard one of them explicitly invoking
the principle that I now identify with Zahavi's principle of costly
authentication. God really appreciates a donation, he said with passionate
sincerity, only when that donation is so large that it hurts. Elderly paupers
were wheeled on to testify how much happier they felt since they had made over
their little all to the Reverend whoever it was.

<P><strong>5.</strong> The patient may notice that the particular convictions
that he holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, do seem to owe a great
deal to epidemiology. Why, he may wonder, do I hold <em>this</em> set of
convictions rather than <em>that</em> set? Is it because I surveyed all the
world's faiths and chose the one whose claims seemed most convincing? Almost
certainly not. If you have a faith, it is statistically overwhelmingly likely
that it is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had.  No doubt
soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving stories and parables, help a
bit. But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the
accident of birth. The convictions that you so passionately believe would have
been a completely different, and largely contradictory, set of convictions, if
only you had happened to be born in a different place.  Epidemiology, not
evidence.

<P><strong>6.</strong> If the patient is one of the rare exceptions who follows
a different religion from his parents, the explanation may still be
epidemiological.  To be sure, it is <em>possible</em> that he dispassionately
surveyed the world's faiths and chose the most convincing one. But it is
statistically more probable that he has been exposed to a particularly potent
infective agent --- a John Wesley, a Jim Jones or a St. Paul. Here we are
talking about horizontal transmission, as in measles. Before, the epidemiology
was that of vertical transmission, as in Huntington's Chorea.

<P><strong>7.</strong> The internal sensations of the patient may be
startlingly reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual
love. This is an extremely potent force in the brain, and it is not surprising
that some viruses have evolved to exploit it. St. Teresa of Avila's famously
orgasmic vision is too notorious to need quoting again. More seriously, and on
a less crudely sensual plane, the philosophy Anthony Kenny provides moving
testimony to the pure delight that awaits those that manage to believe in the
mystery of transubstantiation. After describing his ordination as a Roman
Catholic priest, empowered by laying on of hands to celebrate Mass, he goes on
that he vividly recalls

<BLOCKQUOTE>the exaltation of the first months during which I had the power to
say Mass. Normally a slow and sluggish riser, I would leap early out of bed,
fully awake and full of excitement at the thought of the momentous act I was
privileged to perform. I rarely said the public Community Mass: most days I
celebrated alone at a side altar with a junior member of the College to serve
as acolyte and congregation. But that made no difference to the solemnity of
the sacrifice or the validity of the consecration.
	<br>It was touching the body of Christ, the closeness of the priest to
Jesus, which most enthralled me. I would gaze on the Host after the words of
consecration, soft-eyed like a lover looking into the eyes of his
beloved... Those early days as a priest remain in my memory as days of
fulfilment and tremulous happiness; something precious, and yet too fragile to
last, like a romantic love-affair brought up short by the reality of an
ill-assorted marriage.  (Kenny, 1986, pp. 101-2) </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Dr. Kenny is affectingly believable that it felt to him, as a young priest,
as though he was in love with the consecrated host. What a brilliantly
successful virus! On the same page, incidentally, Kenny also shows us that the
virus is transmitted contagiously --- if not literally then at least in some
sense --- from the palm of the infecting bishop's hand through the top of the
new priest's head:

<BLOCKQUOTE>If Catholic doctrine is true, every priest validly ordained derives
his orders in an unbroken line of laying on of hands, through the bishop who
ordains him, back to one of the twelve Apostles... there must be
centuries-long, recorded chains of layings on of hands. It surprises me that
priests never seem to trouble to trace their spiritual ancestry in this way,
finding out who ordained their bishop, and who ordained him, and so on to
Julius II or Celestine V or Hildebrand, or Gregory the Great, perhaps. (Kenny,
1986, p. 101) </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It surprises me, too.

<H2>4 Is Science a Virus</H2>

No. Not unless all computer programs are viruses. Good, useful programs spread
because people evaluate them, recommend them and pass them on. Computer viruses
spread solely because they embody the coded instructions: ``Spread me.''
Scientific ideas, like all memes, are subject to a kind of natural selection,
and this might look superficially virus-like. But the selective forces that
scrutinize scientific ideas are not arbitrary and capricious.  They are
exacting, well-honed rules, and they do not favor pointless self-serving
behavior. They favor all the virtues laid out in textbooks of standard
methodology: testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability,
consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness,
independence of cultural milieu, and so on. Faith spreads despite a total lack
of every single one of these virtues.

<P>You may find elements of epidemiology in the spread of scientific ideas, but
it will be largely descriptive epidemiology. The rapid spread of a good idea
through the scientific community may even look like a description of a measles
epidemic. But when you examine the underlying reasons you find that they are
good ones, satisfying the demanding standards of scientific method. In the
history of the spread of faith you will find little else but epidemiology, and
causal epidemiology at that. The reason why person A believes one thing and B
believes another is simply and solely that A was born on one continent and B on
another. Testability, evidential support and the rest aren't even remotely
considered. For scientific belief, epidemiology merely comes along afterwards
and describes the history of its acceptance.  For religious belief,
epidemiology is the root cause.

<H2>5 Epilogue</H2>

Happily, viruses don't win every time. Many children emerge unscathed from the
worst that nuns and mullahs can throw at them. Anthony Kenny's own story has a
happy ending. He eventually renounced his orders because he could no longer
tolerate the obvious contradictions within Catholic belief, and he is now a
highly respected scholar. But one cannot help remarking that it must be a
powerful infection indeed that took a man of his wisdom and intelligence ---
President of the British Academy, no less --- three decades to fight off. Am I
unduly alarmist to fear for the soul of my six-year-old innocent?
