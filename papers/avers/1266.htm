Many small businesses today have experienced at least one virus outbreak.
If you haven't been infected by Melissa or Loveletter, you've at least had
to deal with the flood of e-mail that your vendors and correspondents may
have sent you as a result, not to mention the questions and warning
notices from employees and friends.  
</p>

<p class="text">

By now you should already be using
anti-virus software, but how do you know if what you've bought is optimal
for your needs?  If you need to renew your license, should you try a new
vendor?  If you've never purchased anti-virus software before, how do you
know what to buy? This article will attempt to offer readers some
guidelines to help them buy the virus protection that is most appropriate
for their small business. In addition to advising readers on what
to look for in anti-virus software, this discussion will also provide
some resources that readers can use to evaluate the various products that
are available.

</p>

<p class="title">
<b>
Matching Anti-Virus Software to the Company's Needs
</b>
</p>

<p class="text">

Before you update your existing anti-virus software licenses or buy new
software, you should consider how your company will use the software.  If
your business requires the constant exchange of Word documents, then
excellent Macro virus protection is crucial.  If you exchange many
different types of e-mail attachments, protection against scripted worms
and other exploits may be more important.  If you do neither of these
things in quantity, good general protection may be sufficient and ease of
use may become a more important consideration. As this discussion
proceeds, we will point out some of the ways in which it is important to
evaluate anti-virus software in the context of the organization's
particular needs. 

</p>

<p class="title">
<b>
Matching Anti-Virus Software to the Company's Capabilities
</b>
</p>

<p class="text">

In order to protect your business effectively, your anti-virus software
should be easy to install, configure, and manage, and it should fit with
the technological expertise of the organization's administrative staff.  
The world's greatest anti-virus detection is of little use if you can't
figure out how to deploy it, if updates are difficult to implement, if
management of the software is a time consuming chore or the software
doesn't provide protection for the way your business uses its computers.

</p>
<p class="text">

This aspect is particularly relevant to small enterprises that may not
have the resources to devote to a full-time, highly-qualified security
administrator. In organizations of twenty people or less, this position
may be filled  on a part-time basis by someone who does not have any
technical training or experience. In cases such as this, it is imperative
for the security of the organization that the anti-virus software that is
purchased is suitable to the expertise of the administrator. It is also
imperative that the software fits the network's users. If the employees
find it intrusive or think it slows down their computer, they'll probably
disable it.  Then all the software in the world won't protect you from an
outbreak.

</p>
<p class="text">
On the other hand, software that's a snap to manage and doesn't require a
lot of configuration is hardly worth buying if it misses viruses, and you
spend more time cleaning up the mess than you spent on the software.
Striking a balance between ease of use and protection isn't easy, and the
information about which anti-virus software is the "best" can often be
confusing.  
</p>
<p class="title">
<b>
Resources for Evaluating Anti-Virus Software
</b>
</p>
<p class="text">
So how do you evaluate anti-virus software carefully before you buy?  Is
there such a thing as "best of breed" anti-virus software?  How do you
wade through the marketing claims of the anti-virus companies and get to
the bottom line - protection, ease of use and non-intrusiveness?
</p>
<p class="=title">
Magazine Product Reviews
</p>

<p class="text">

Anti-virus software can be evaluated regularly in several ways.  PC
magazines, such as ZDNet's <a target="nonlocal" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/print/infocus/www.zdnet.com">PC
Magazine</a>, routinely evaluate the major vendors, both in product
reviews and in side-by-side product comparisons.  These reviews often
provide useful information, such as the price per unit, ease of use
ratings and overall product ratings.  Unfortunately, they don't tell the
whole story.  They generally use relatively small virus collections to
test the software, and they seldom reveal the qualifications of the test
lab staff.  They also don't test the full range of products that are
available.

</p>
<p class="title">
TruSecure Certification
</p>

<p class="text">

There are also online services that evaluate a-v software. One good
source for product evaluations is TruSecure Corporation (formerly
ICSA.net.)  According to their web site's "About Us" link, "The ICSA Labs
sets standards, performs research, tracks and measures risks, and
certifies 98 percent of the market's anti-virus software." ICSA.net has
been certifying anti-virus software for 11 years.  They certify anti-virus
products in a number of categories, including On-Demand/On-Access,
Cleaning, Internet Gateways, Microsoft Exchange Gateways, Lotus Notes
Gateways, ASPs, ISPs and On-Line Scanners. (To view a list of products that TruSecure has
certified, click <a target="nonlocal" href="http://www.icsalabs.com/html/communities/antivirus/certifiedproducts.shtml">here</a>.)

</p>
<p class="text">

Once a product has been certified, TruSecure tests it every three months,
without
prior notification to the vendor, to assure ongoing compliance.  If a
vendor's product fails the certification check, TruSecure will notify the
vendor and give them a seven-day window to correct the defect and publish
it on their web site.  Otherwise, they will lose their certification, and
they will have to publish a major version update (rather than a quick fix)
to be certified again.

</p>
<p class="text">
An ICSA Labs certification indicates that an anti-virus product offers the
following:
</p><ul>
<li>
100% detection of the viruses listed in the current in-the-wild list;
</li>
<li>
100% detection of the viruses in the ICSA Common Infectors Test Suite;
</li>
<li>
100% detection of ICSA's Polymorphic Test Suite;
</li>
<li>
90% detection of macro viruses in the ICSA Virus Collection;
</li>
<li>
90% detection of the ICSA Virus Collection; and,
</li>
<li>
zero false alarms.
</li>
</ul>



<p class="text">

As you can see, a product that achieves ICSA certification has met some
fairly stringent criteria for performance.  If a product is ICSA
certified, you can probably depend upon that product to protect your
business from the devastating effects of a virus outbreak.  

</p>
<p class="text">

This list indicates the necessity to understand the particular anti-virus
needs of your organization. For instance, if your business needs excellent
Macro protection, you will need to examine the product evaluations
carefully, 90% detection will not be good enough.

</p>

<p class="title">
Virus Bulletin
</p>

<p class="text">

Another evaluation process that is even more stringent than ICSA's; the <a target="nonlocal" href="http://www.virusbtn.com/100/">Virus Bulletin 100%
awards</a>.  The VB 100% award is the technophile's equivalent of the
Oscar.  In order to win a VB 100% award, an anti-virus product must not
fail to detect a single in-the-wild virus. (An "in the wild" virus is one
that has been detected in general circulation, outside of a controlled
laboratory environment by someone who reports that detection to the
"official" Wild List.)

</p>
<p class="text">

The Virus Bulletin awards the prestigious VB 100% award bi-monthly,
testing products on different platforms every other month.  These include
Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows NT, Novell Netware 5.1, and DOS. To view a helpful summary
chart that reveals a product's
performance over the past two years is available, to view it, click <a target="nonlocal" href="http://www.virusbtn.com/100/vb100sum.html">here</a>.

</p>
<p class="text">

When you study the results at the Virus Bulletin web site, you should
notice a pattern.  Some products that have done well in the past may not
have done particularly well recently.  Other products that haven't done
well in the past have done quite well recently.  What this means is a
source of constant argument among virus experts.  Some commentators
contend that if a product misses one single virus, it is not worth using.
(They frequently change their tune when their personal favorite fails to
make the grade.)  Others argue that one must examine the testing criteria
and the results carefully to determine the cause of the failure before
making a determination about the meaning of the tests.

</p>
<p class="text">

Adding to the confusion is the fact that some vendors, even ones offering
ICSA certified products, don't submit their products to the Virus Bulletin
for testing.  It isn't possible to say with certainty why any particular
vendor failed to submit a product for testing.  If you're interested in
finding out more, the cost of a subscription to the Virus Bulletin is $395
US annually.  While this may be outside the budget of some small
businesses, others may find it worthwhile to have the details of each test
at hand when making buying decisions.

</p>
<p class="title">
AV-Test.Org
</p>
<p class="text">

Another entry to the anti-virus testing field is <a target="nonlocal" href="http://www.av-test.org/">AV-Test.org</a>, a cooperative effort between
an IT consulting firm and the Business Information Workgroup at the
Institute of Technical and Business Information Systems at the
Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg.  Their test results are
downloadable and can be viewed on line also, in the form of a spreadsheet.
The results are comprehensive, but they can be a bit difficult to follow
because of the format.  Keep in mind also that many of the products tested
are the German versions, and they may not be fully comparable to the
version you are using.

</p>
<p class="title">
<b>
Evaluating Anti-Virus Software for the Company's Needs
</b>
</p>
<p class="text">

We referred earlier to the need to take your company's needs into
account, and the online resources can help in this respect. For instance, 
if an on-access scanner fails to detect every boot virus, 
should you strike it from your list of potential purchases?  Boot viruses
are rare today, and they are usually transmitted by floppy disk.  If you
don't exchange many floppy disks in your business, the likelihood of
contracting a boot virus is much less than it would be if you exchanged
floppies routinely.

</p>
<p class="text">

On the other hand, if a scanner does a poor job of detecting Visual Basic
viruses (like Loveletter) and you conduct business routinely by e-mail,
you may want to think twice about using that scanner, even if you've used
it in the past without incident.  This is particularly true if your
company has chosen Outlook or Outlook Express as your e-mail client,
because these viruses tend to target the Microsoft mail clients.  The
decision is even more critical if you use Microsoft Exchange as your mail
server platform.

</p>
<p class="title">
<b>
Evaluating Anti-Virus Software for Ease of Use
</b>
</p>
<p class="text">

Once you've determined the competency of various vendors' products, you
should consider the user and management interfaces.  How easy is the
software to use?  How difficult is it to manage?  These are questions that
are not easily answered.  Outside the magazine product reviews, which
provide some assistance, there are no competent testing sites for
interface review. Here you are essentially on your own.

</p>
<p class="text">

Anti-virus product vendors have only recently begun focusing on
improvement of the management of their products.  Depending on the size of
your business, it may be easier to install and update the software by hand
than it is to use the management interface.  (It may also be much
cheaper.)  However, there is a point at which manual installation and
updating is cost prohibitive.  Then the management interface can make or
break your efforts to protect yourself.  Surprisingly, some vendor's
management interfaces are significantly easier to use in small businesses
than they are in large enterprises.

</p>
<p class="title">
<b>
Evaluating Anti-Virus Through Free Trial Periods
</b>
</p>
<p class="text">

Many vendors make their software available for download on a trial basis.
During the evaluation phase, you should take advantage of this to test the
product's interface and operating characteristics.  Here you are not
concerned about detection or cleaning capability.  You simply want to know
how easy the product is to use and update.  What are the "gotchas" that
will haunt you later on?  To some degree, this is a matter of personal
taste, so you should ask several people to try the software out.  Set a
specific time frame for the trial and ask them to give you their
evaluation of the interface.  Ask them if there was anything that made it
difficult to use or understand.  Did it interfere with their work?  Was
there anything they found particularly annoying about it?

</p>

<p class="text">

This evaluation should only be done once you've narrowed your choice of
software to three or at the most four products.  These should be products
which professional testing shows will provide the protection you need for
your specific uses.  At this point, your goal shouldn't be to choose the
"best" product but the most effective one for your business.  As a small
business owner, you cannot afford to select a product that your employees
won't use, regardless of its capabilities.

<p class="title">
<b>
Evaluating Anti-Virus Updates
</b>
</p>

<p class="text">

The recent outbreak of the "Anna Kournikova" virus revealed weaknesses in
some vendors' detection schemes while other vendors had detection in place
before the virus was released.  Even the best detection capability and a
fine management interface is useless if the software isn't used or updated
properly.  Configuring and updating the software is just as important as
its capabilities, perhaps even more so.

</p>
<p class="text">

During this "usefulness" evaluation, you should look at how the software
is updated, because updating is critical to obtaining protection against
newly discovered viruses.  Can you download the updates to your network
and update all the clients from there?  Or will you have to depend upon
the vagaries of Internet connectivity to get updates when they are
critical?  Recent virus outbreaks have shown that getting updates can be
very problematic when a virus outbreak has occurred, as networks all over
the world are trying to update at the same time.  Some vendors have taken
steps to alleviate the problem by providing alternate download sites.
Check to see if the ones you are evaluating offer this service. It may
prove critical in a crisis situation.

</p>
<p class="text">

Check to see if the vendor offers "emergency" updates.  If they do, how
easy are they to install?  Some vendors offer daily updates, others offer
weekly updates.  Recent experience has shown that the fast pace of
updating may be detrimental.  Some vendors have had to recall updates
after releasing them.  Others have had to rush new updates out to correct
a problem with previous ones.

</p>

<p class="title">
<b>
Evaluating Anti-Virus Software by Price
</b>
</p>

<p class="text">

Once you've assessed the competency of a product and evaluated its
usefulness, the last thing to consider is price.  At this point, the
products you've selected should be comparable enough that price could be
the deciding factor.  Does a vendor have incentives for volume purchasing?
Does anyone have a special offer that would save your company money?  What
will it cost to renew in the future?  How often does the vendor change
versions?  Do the versions require the purchase of new licenses?  Or will
your present license cover updates for a specified period of time?

</p>
<p class="title">
<b>
The End of the Beginning
</b>
</p>
<p class="text">
After you've evaluated a product's competency, usability and price, you
can purchase with the confidence that you will be protected from virus
attacks both now and in the future, because you've shopped prudently and
chosen wisely. However, purchasing the anti-virus software is not the end
of the process; rather, as Winston Churchill once stated, it is only the
end of the beginning.
</p>

<p class="text">

Once the new anti-virus software has been researched, purchased and
installed, it is still necessary to keep your software up to date.
Furthermore, because an organization's computers are interconnected, it is
vital that all people who are working on the network are aware of the
risks that viruses pose. As such, it is crucial that ongoing user
education is implemented to make sure that the networks users are not
jeopardizing the protection that the anti-virus software provides. Users
must be made aware of the software and how to operate it when required,
for scanning floppy disks or e-mail attachments, for instance. As alluded
to earlier, they must be made aware of the importance of the software so
that they don't disable it or make it otherwise inoperable.

</p>
<p class="text">

While the process of evaluating, purchasing and administering anti-virus
software may seem daunting to the small business operator, think of how
much trouble it may save in the long run. Once an effective, appropriate
program is in place and regular updates are scheduled, the organization
can get on with the many other challenges of running a small business,
secure in the knowledge that their network and the valuable information
that resides on it is as safe as possible from virus infection.
