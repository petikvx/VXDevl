Introduction <BR>
</B>Polymorphic computer viruses are the most complex and difficult viruses to detect, often requiring <BR>
anti-virus companies to spend days or months creating the detection routines needed to catch a <BR>
single polymorphic. <BR>
<P>
This white paper provides an overview of polymorphics and existing methods of detection, and <BR>
introduces Symantec's Striker ª technology, a new, patent-pending method for detecting polymorphics. <BR>
<P>
Norton AntiVirus 2.0 for Windows 95 is the first Symantec anti-virus product to include Striker; <BR>
Symantec will integrate Striker into other Norton anti-virus products as it introduces new editions. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Evolution of Polymorphic Viruses <BR>
</B>A computer virus is a self-replicating computer program that operates without the consent of the <BR>
user. It spreads by attaching a copy of itself to some part of a program file, such as a spreadsheet <BR>
or word processor. Viruses also attack boot records and master boot records, which contain the <BR>
information a computer uses to start up. Macro viruses attack such files as word processing docu-ments <BR>
or spreadsheets. <BR>
<P>
Most viruses simply replicate. Some display messages. Some, however, deliver a payload Ñ a portion <BR>
of the virus program that is designed to corrupt programs, delete files, reformat a hard disk, or crash <BR>
a corporate-wide network, potentially wiping out years of data and destroying critical information. <BR>
<P>
<B>Simple Viruses <BR>
</B>A simple virus that merely replicates itself is the easiest to detect. If a user launches an infected pro-gram, <BR>
the virus gains control of the computer and attaches a copy of itself to another program file. <BR>
After it spreads, the virus transfers control back to the host program, which functions normally. <BR>
<P>
Yet no matter how many times a simple virus infects a new file or floppy disk, for example, the <BR>
infection always makes an exact copy of itself. Anti-virus software need only search, or scan, for <BR>
a tell-tale sequence of bytes Ñ known as a signature Ñ found in the virus. <BR>
<P>
<B>Encrypted Viruses <BR>
</B>In response, virus authors began encrypting viruses. The idea was to hide the fixed signature by <BR>
scrambling the virus, making it unrecognizable to a virus scanner.

<BR>
<B>3 <BR>
</B>An encrypted virus consists of a virus decryption routine and an encrypted virus body. If a user <BR>
launches an infected program, the virus decryption routine first gains control of the computer, <BR>
then decrypts the virus body. Next, the decryption routine transfers control of the computer to the <BR>
decrypted virus. <BR>
<P>
An encrypted virus infects programs and files as any simple virus does. Each time it infects a new <BR>
program, the virus makes a copy of both the decrypted virus body and its related decryption routine, <BR>
encrypts the copy, and attaches both to a target. <BR>
<P>
To encrypt the copy of the virus body, an encrypted virus uses an encryption key that the virus is <BR>
programmed to change from infection to infection. As this key changes, the scrambling of the virus <BR>
body changes, making the virus appear different from infection to infection. This makes it extremely <BR>
difficult for anti-virus software to search for a virus signature extracted from a consistent virus body. <BR>
<P>
However, the decryption routines remain constant from generation to generation Ñ a weakness that <BR>
anti-virus software quickly evolved to exploit. Instead of scanning just for virus signatures, virus <BR>
scanners were modified to also search for the tell-tale sequence of bytes that identified a specific <BR>
decryption routine. <BR>
<P>
<B>Polymorphic Viruses <BR>
</B>In retaliation, virus authors developed the polymorphic virus. Like an encrypted virus, a polymorphic <BR>
virus includes a scrambled virus body and a decryption routine that first gains control of the comput-er, <BR>
then decrypts the virus body. <BR>
<P>
However, a polymorphic virus adds to these two components a third Ñ a mutation engine that gen-erates <BR>
randomized decryption routines that change each time a virus infects a new program. <BR>
<P>
In a polymorphic virus, the mutation engine and virus body are both encrypted. When a user runs a <BR>
program infected with a polymorphic virus, the decryption routine first gains control of the computer, <BR>
then decrypts both the virus body and the mutation engine. Next, the decryption routine transfers <BR>
control of the computer to the virus, which locates a new program to infect. <BR>
<P>
At this point, the virus makes a copy of both itself and the mutation engine in random access memory <BR>
(RAM). The virus then invokes the mutation engine, which randomly generates a new decryption <BR>
routine that is capable of decrypting the virus, yet bears little or no resemblance to any prior decryp-tion <BR>
routine. Next, the virus encrypts this new copy of the virus body and mutation engine. Finally, the <BR>
virus appends this new decryption routine, along with the newly encrypted virus and mutation engine, <BR>
onto a new program. <BR>

<BR>
As a result, not only is the virus body encrypted, but the virus decryption routine varies from infection <BR>
to infection. This confounds a virus scanner searching for the tell-tale sequence of bytes that identi-fies <BR>
a specific decryption routine. <BR>
<P>
With no fixed signature to scan for, and no fixed decryption routine, no two infections look alike. <BR>
The result is a formidable adversary. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Scale of the Problem <BR>
</B>The Tequila and Maltese Amoeba viruses caused the first widespread polymorphic infections in 1991. <BR>
<P>
In 1992, in a harrowing development, Dark Avenger, author of Maltese Amoeba, distributed the <BR>
Mutation Engine, also known as MtE, to other virus authors with instructions on how to use it to <BR>
build still more polymorphics. <BR>
<P>
It is now common practice for virus authors to distribute their mutation engines, making them widely <BR>
available for other virus authors to use as if they were do-it-yourself kits. <BR>
<P>
Today, anti-virus researchers report that polymorphic viruses comprise about five percent of the <BR>
more than 8,000 known viruses. <BR>
<P>
Of these, SARC reports only a small number of polymorphics "in the wild" Ñ just 20 as of mid-1996. <BR>
Yet this represents an increase of 25 percent from 16 polymorphics in the wild in mid-1995, <BR>
a year earlier. Also, anti-virus researchers have identified 50 mutation engines. SARC reports 13 <BR>
mutation engines in the wild as of mid-1996, up 30 percent in one year from 10 mutation engines <BR>
reported in the wild as of mid-1995. <BR>
<P>
Two polymorphics Ñ One Half and Natas Ñ rank among the 20 most-prevalent computer viruses, <BR>
according to the <I>1996 Computer Virus Prevalence Survey </I>conducted by the National Computer <BR>
Security Association (NCSA). <BR>
<P>
One Half slowly encrypts a hard disk. Natas, also known as SatanBug. Natas, is highly polymorphic, <BR>
designed to evade and attack anti-virus software. It infects .COM and .EXE program files. <BR>
<P>
<B>Polymorphic Detection <BR>
</B>Anti-virus researchers first fought back by creating special detection routines designed to catch <BR>
each polymorphic virus, one by one. By hand, line by line, they wrote special programs designed to <BR>
detect various sequences of computer code known to be used by a given mutation engine to decrypt <BR>
a virus body. <BR>
<P>
This approach proved inherently impractical, time-consuming, and costly. Each new polymorphic <BR>
requires its own detection program. Also, a mutation engine produces seemingly random programs, <BR>
any of which can properly perform decryption Ñ and some mutation engines generate billions upon <BR>
billions of variations. <BR>
<P>

<A href=#page6>6</A>
<strong><A name=page7> Page 7</A></strong>
<A href=#page8>8</A>
<BR>
Moreover, many polymorphics use the same mutation engine, thanks to the Dark Avenger and other <BR>
virus authors who have distributed engines. Also, different engines used by different polymorphics <BR>
often generate similar decryption routines, which makes any identification based solely on decryption <BR>
routines wholly unreliable. <BR>
<P>
This approach also leads to mistakenly identifying one polymorphic as another. These shortcomings <BR>
led anti-virus researchers to develop generic decryption techniques that trick a polymorphic virus <BR>
into decrypting and revealing itself. <BR>
<P>
<B>Generic Decryption <BR>
</B>Generic decryption assumes: <BR>
<P>
° The body of a polymorphic virus is encrypted to avoid detection. <BR>
° A polymorphic virus must decrypt before it can execute normally. <BR>
° Once an infected program begins to execute, a polymorphic virus must immediately usurp control <BR>
of the computer to decrypt the virus body, then yield control of the computer to the decrypted virus. <BR>
<P>
A scanner that uses generic decryption relies on this behavior to detect polymorphics. Each time it <BR>
scans a new program file, it loads this file into a self-contained virtual computer created from RAM. <BR>
Inside this virtual computer, program files execute as if running on a real computer. <BR>
<P>
The scanner monitors and controls the program file as it executes inside the virtual computer. A <BR>
polymorphic virus running inside the virtual computer can do no damage because it is isolated from <BR>
the real computer. <BR>
<P>
When a scanner loads a file infected by a polymorphic virus into this virtual computer, the virus <BR>
decryption routine executes and decrypts the encrypted virus body. This exposes the virus body to the <BR>
scanner, which can then search for signatures in the virus body that precisely identify the virus strain. <BR>
<P>
If the scanner loads a file that is not infected, there is no virus to expose and monitor. In response <BR>
to nonvirus behavior, the scanner quickly stops running the file inside the virtual computer, removes <BR>
the file from the virtual computer, and proceeds to scan the next file. <BR>
<P>
The process is like injecting a mouse with a serum that may or may not contain a virus, and then <BR>
observing the mouse for adverse affects. If the mouse becomes ill, researchers observe the visible <BR>
symptoms, match them to known symptoms, and identify the virus. If the mouse remains healthy, <BR>
researchers select another vial of serum and repeat the process. <BR>

<BR>
The key problem with generic decryption is speed. Generic decryption is of no practical use if it <BR>
spends five hours waiting for a polymorphic virus to decrypt inside the virtual computer. Similarly, if <BR>
generic decryption simply stops short, it may miss a polymorphic before it is able to reveal enough <BR>
of itself for the scanner to detect a signature. <BR>
<P>
<B>Heuristic-Based Generic Decryption <BR>
</B>To solve this problem, generic decryption employs "heuristics," a generic set of rules that helps <BR>
differentiate non-virus from virus behavior. <BR>
<P>
As an example, a typical nonvirus program will in all likelihood use the results from math computa-tions <BR>
it makes as it runs inside the virtual computer. On the other hand, a polymorphic virus may <BR>
perform similar computations, yet throw away the results because those results are irrelevant to the <BR>
virus. In fact, a polymorphic may perform such computations solely to look like a clean program in <BR>
an attempt to elude the virus scanner. <BR>
<P>
Heuristic-based generic decryption looks for such inconsistent behavior. An inconsistency increases <BR>
the likelihood of infection and prompts a scanner that relies on heuristic-based rules to extend the <BR>
length of time a suspect file executes inside the virtual computer, giving a potentially infected file <BR>
enough time to decrypt itself and expose a lurking virus. <BR>

<I>Figure 9. Now the generic decryption scanner searches for virus signatures in those areas of <BR>
virtual memory that were decrypted and/ or modified in any way by the virus. This is the most <BR>
likely location for virus signatures. </I>

Inhibitor Rules <BR>
</B>° If the contents of a register are destroyed before being used, increase VirusProbability by 1.2%. <BR>
° If a NOP instruction is encountered, then increase VirusProbability by .5%. <BR>
<P>
° If the program does no memory writes within 100 executed instructions, decrease VirusProbability by 5%. <BR>
° If the program generates DOS interrupts, decrease VirusProbability by 15%. <BR>
<P>
<I>Figure 10. Initially the generic decryptor assumes that every file has a 10% probability of <BR>
infection. Emulation continues as long as the virus probability is greater than zero. This virus <BR>
probability is updated as the various rules observe virus-like or non-virus-like behavior during <BR>
emulation. <BR>
</I><P>
Unfortunately, heuristics demand continual research and updating. Heuristic rules tuned to detect <BR>
500 viruses, for example, may miss 10 of those viruses when altered to detect 5 new viruses. <BR>
<P>
Also, as virus writers continue trying to make viruses look like clean programs, heuristics can easily <BR>
balloon to the point where almost any program might share attributes that trigger the scanner to <BR>
lengthen the time it takes to examine a file. <BR>
<P>
In addition, generic decryption must rely on a team of anti-virus researchers able to analyze millions <BR>
of potential virus variations, extract a signature, then modify a set of heuristics while also guarding <BR>
against the implications of changing any heuristic rules. This requires extensive, exhaustive regression <BR>
testing. Without this commitment, heuristics quickly becomes obsolete, inaccurate, and inefficient. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Striker System <BR>
</B>Symantec's Striker system provides anti-virus researchers with a new weapon to detect polymorphics. <BR>
<P>
Like generic decryption, each time it scans a new program file, Striker loads this file into a self-contained <BR>
virtual computer created from RAM. The program executes in this virtual computer as if <BR>
it were running on a real computer. <BR>
<P>
However, Striker does not rely on heuristic guesses to guide decryption. Instead, it relies on virus <BR>
profiles or rules that are specific to each virus, not a generic set of rules that differentiate nonvirus <BR>
from virus behavior. <BR>
<P>
When scanning a new file, Striker first attempts to exclude as many viruses as possible from consid-eration, <BR>
just as a doctor rules out the possibility of chicken pox if an examination fails to detect scabs <BR>
on a patient's body. <BR>
<P>
For example, different viruses infect different executable file formats. Some infect only .COM files. <BR>
Others infect only .EXE files. Some viruses infect both. Very few infect .SYS files. As a result, as it <BR>
scans an .EXE file, Striker ignores polymorphics that infect only .COM and .SYS files. If all viruses are <BR>
eliminated from consideration, then the file is deemed clean. Striker closes it and advances to scan <BR>
the next file. 
11
<BR>
<A href=#page11>11</A>
<strong><A name=page12> Page 12</A></strong>
<A href=#page13>13</A>
<BR>
<B>10 <BR>
</B>If this preliminary scan does not rule out infection, Striker continues to run the file inside the virtual <BR>
computer as long as the behavior of the suspect file is consistent with at least one known polymor-phic <BR>
or mutation engine. <BR>
<P>
For example, one polymorphic virus is known to perform math computations and throw away the <BR>
results. A second polymorphic may never perform such calculations. Instead, it may use specific ran-dom <BR>
instructions in its decryption routine. A third polymorphic may call on the operating system as it <BR>
decrypts. <BR>
<P>
Striker catalogs these and nearly 500 other characteristics into each virus profile, one for each <BR>
polymorphic and mutation engine. <BR>
<P>
Consider a set of generic heuristic rules that identify A, B, C, D, and E as potential virus behaviors. <BR>
In contrast, a Striker profile calls for Virus 1 to execute behaviors A, B, and C. As it decrypts, Virus 2 <BR>
executes behaviors A, B, and D, while Virus 3 executes behaviors B, D, and E. <BR>
<P>
If Striker observes behavior A while running a suspect file inside the virtual computer, this is consis-tent <BR>
with viruses 1 and 2. However, it is not consistent with Virus 3. Striker eliminates Virus 3 from <BR>
consideration. <BR>
<P>
The heuristic-based system must continue searching for all three viruses, however, because it <BR>
observes behavior that is consistent with its generic rules. <BR>
<P>
If Striker next observes behavior B, this is consistent with viruses 1 and 2. Striker must continue <BR>
scanning for these two viruses. However, the heuristics again continue to search for all three viruses. <BR>
<P>
Finally, if Striker observes behavior E, this eliminates Virus 2 from consideration, and Striker now <BR>
pursues a single potential virus. <BR>
<P>
The heuristic-based scanner continues to search for all three viruses. <BR>
Under Striker, this process continues until the behavior of the program running inside the virtual <BR>
computer is inconsistent with the behavior of any known polymorphic or mutation engine. At this <BR>
point, Striker excludes all viruses from consideration. <BR>
<P>
On the other hand, a heuristic-based system scans for all viruses all the time. It must find some <BR>
behavior inconsistent with all behaviors. <BR>
<P>
<B>Striker's Strategic Advantages <BR>
</B>Clearly the first advantage to Striker's approach is speed. The profiles enable Striker to quickly <BR>
exclude some polymorphic viruses and home in on others. In contrast, heuristics labor on, scanning <BR>
all program files against all available generic rules of how all known polymorphics and all known <BR>
mutation engines might behave. <BR>
<P>
The profiles also enable Striker to process uninfected files quickly, minimizing impact on system <BR>
performance. In contrast, heuristic-based scanning is more likely to decrease system performance, <BR>
because uninfected files must also be scanned against all generic rules for how all known polymor-phics <BR>
and mutation engines might behave. <BR>
<P>
Second, anti-virus researchers are no longer forced to rewrite complex heuristic rules to scan for <BR>
each new virus, then exhaustively test and retest to ensure they do not inadvertently miss a polymor-phic <BR>
the software previously detected.

<A href=#page14>14</A>
<BR>
<B>11 <BR>
</B>Third, with Striker, a team of anti-virus researchers may work in parallel, building profiles for many <BR>
new polymorphic viruses, swiftly adding each to Striker. Each profile is unique, much like a virus sig-nature, <BR>
independent of any other profile. The old profiles still work, and the new profile does not <BR>
affect the old. Exhaustive, time-consuming regression testing is no longer necessary. It becomes easy <BR>
to update anti-virus software by compiling new virus profiles into the Norton Antivirus database file <BR>
that is posted online monthly or obtained on floppy disk. <BR>
<P>
<B>Outlook <BR>
</B>To date, generic decryption has proved to be the single most effective method of detecting poly-morphics. <BR>
Striker improves on this approach. <BR>
<P>
Yet it is only a matter of time before virus authors design some new, insidious type of virus that <BR>
evades current methods of detection. <BR>
<P>
Virus authors might design a polymorphic virus that decrypts half the time, for example, yet remains <BR>
dormant at other times. Anti-virus software could not reliably detect such a virus if it does not decrypt <BR>
itself every time the file is loaded into the virtual computer. In this case, a hand-coded detection <BR>
routine will be needed. <BR>
<P>
Or, imagine a host program that waits for the user to press a specific key and then terminates. A <BR>
polymorphic infecting this host might only take control just after the user enters the required key-stroke. <BR>
If the user enters the keystroke, the virus runs. If not, the virus gets no opportunity to launch. <BR>
However, inside the virtual computer created by generic decryption, the program would never receive <BR>
the needed keystroke Ñ and the virus would never have a chance to decrypt. <BR>
<P>
A small number of viruses are already resistant to detection by generic decryption. There's no <BR>
doubt that virus authors will continue to design new viruses, using new technologies, creating new <BR>
problems. Anti-virus researchers will need to deal with these new threats, just as Striker today <BR>
delivers the solution that best protects computer users against polymorphics. <BR>
