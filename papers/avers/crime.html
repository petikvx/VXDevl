<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
This paper will consider the social and ethical factors involved in
the transmission of computer viruses and other malicious software.
In addition to the people, we will consider the part the systems and
technology play in the spread of this sort of data. We will draw parallels
with one of the more well known scientific paradigms, the medical
one, and note the similarities with the problems we now face. We
will describe the evolution of methods of virus distribution: virus
exchange bulletin boards, virus exchange networks, distribution sites,
robots/servers, and books. The paper will discuss viruses for sale
and make some comparisons between distribution of computer viruses
and the distribution methods of ``hacking tools''. Other issues examined
in this paper include the characteristics of individuals involved
in the distribution of these types of programs, and problems of legal
redress, as well as possible solutions based on ethics and ethical
theory.

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
We have available today a global system of communication technology.
There also exist programs whose purpose is to disrupt the way this
system functions. Moreover, the system is the perfect medium to host
and transfer the very programs designed to destroy the functionality
of the system itself. In this paper we will discuss the factors usually
neglected in studies concerning computer virus infections.

<b>1.1 Traditional Epidemiological Studies</b>

and control of disease in a population 

2: the sum of the factors controlling the presence or absence of a
disease or pathogen (Webster's)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are various factors commonly considered when estimating the
probability of virus infections. We have factors such as the ability
of the virus to replicate, the amount of contact any given machine
has with the general population of computers, and the presence of
any computers currently infected. Elaborate studies have been done
to calculate the possibilities of any given population becoming infected.
In one such study by Dr. Alan Solomon [Solomon, 1990], one conclusion
is that early detection is a very effective way to reduce the incidence
of viruses in a population of computers. In fact, early detection
is cited as one of the crucial factors in limiting infection. One
such model [see Footnote 1] illustrates how finding a virus contributes
to its detection and eradication.
<p>
There are cases however, where a virus being `found' means it
will spread further and further; the same can be said of some hacking
tools. These cases are where the malicious programs are `found' on
computing systems, where they have been placed for exchange or distribution.
These are programs which will not be detected in their `current state'
by any virus detector or casual search methodologies. When they are
found, by people looking for them (and in some cases by the casual
observer who just happens to see them, download or ftp them, and use
them), they spread from user to user and their use becomes widespread;
in some cases, epidemic.

<b>1.1.2 Social aspects</b>
<p>
In addition to being concerned with detecting viruses which are active
in computing systems, we now find ourselves in the position of needing
to detect and identify viruses and other malicious software which
are non-active. We are faced today with an entire system of communication
technology which is the perfect medium to host and transfer the
very programs designed to destroy the functionality of the systems.
We suggest that technologies not only tend be created out of human
endeavor and the accompanying social values, but to shape the values
of the communities from which they arise; that they can take on an
ethical/moral dynamic of their own. These values, as we will show,
are not always consistent with the values of the communities which
create them.
<P>

<p><a name="CAUSAL">
<h4>2. The causal connection</h4>
<p>
In this section, we will examine the sorts of programs which are sometimes
used in criminal and/or unethical ways. People which make use of the
current technology to distribute the tools and information will be
discussed.
<p>
<a name="MALICIOUS">
<b>2.1 Malicious software</b>
<p>
By malicious program, we refer to a program designed to perform a
harmful action. This action could range from deliberate destruction
of data, as is the case with some viruses, to the interception of
confidential information, as is the case with programs such as the
recently publicised sunsniffer. For the purposes of this paper, the
computing technologies referred to are those which are affected, or
which have the potential to be affected.
<p>
While it is not required for a program to do obvious damage to classify
as a virus, for the purpose of this paper we will stipulate a virus
as a program that replicates in some environment, alters executable
code and does damage by controlling your computer system without your
knowledge or consent; we will stipulate a trojan as a program which
appears legitimate, but which does deliberate damage to your computer
system's files. While viruses have for the most part been confined
to personal computers running under MS-DOS, we are beginning to see
both more interest and more viruses written for UNIX based systems.
<P>
The hacking tools discussed are computer programs including trojanized
login programs, which capture passwords, shell scripts which exploit
operating system bugs and text files which give instructions on how
to hack computer systems.
<P>
Of course, these programs alone do no damage. They must be installed,
executed or read and used as "instruction manuals"; this is accomplished
initially by a human. It is interesting to note that many people
insist that programs are `unethical'. Other voices insist the programs
are not capable of being ethical or unethical; they are simply code.
Traditionally, programs were not seen as capable of being ethical
or non-ethical in and of themselves, primarily because they were not
autonomous agents. However, viruses have the capability to be exactly
this. For this reason, if the viruses we are seeing today are in any
way the precursors to full-scale autonomous agents, we should be concerned
with which ethical models we will incorporate into them. Will they
make their decisions based on the good of all of society; will they
make their decision based on unwavering moral principles? Will they
be totally self-preservationist? There appears to be little if anything
to indicate these programs with which we are concerned in this
paper bear any relationship to artificial intelligence or artificial
life despite claims to the contrary by their producers, and for this
reason are not ethical or unethical in and of themselves.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="INDIVIDUALS">
<b>2.2. Individuals</b>
<p>
The sort of people which play a role in the distribution of this
malicious information vary. There are malicious, intentional players,
as well as non-malicious accidental players. We will begin with the
virus writers. It would be an error to place them all in one category.
They are as diverse as their viruses; each with his own motivation
and each subscribing to his own choice of distribution method. The
term `his' is specifically used because there is no evidence of any
female virus writer who participates consistently in distribution
of computer viruses. The gender issue is one which is discussed in
the paper <a href="GenericVirusWriter.html">The Generic Virus Writer</a> [Gordon, 94]; it will not
be disussed further at this time except to note there is a gender
issue.
<p>
Virus writers can come from all walks of life; they are diverse in
age, location, academic background, and goal. In some cases, the goal
is malicious in nature; in other cases, there appears to be no malicious
intent. The same is true of the hacker. The traditional profile of
hacker [Swanson, Chamelin and Territo, 92] as young adult male, 19-25,
socially inept seems to be somewhat inaccurate. There are women
involved in the hacker culture, not just as `fans' and `hangers-on',
but as contributory entities. 
<p>
Another similarity between types of the virus-involved individuals
and roles of the individuals in their subculture and that of hackers
and those involved in their subculture is that both may exhibit `parasitic'
behaviour. Parasite in this context refers to people who have
no skills of writing replicating code, nor any abilities related to
what is commonly referred to as <i>hacking</i>. These people participate
in the culture by helping distribute the programs, and the information
in crude, traditional ways; telephone conversations, bulletin board
chats, uploading/downloading files on dial-up bulletin boards; use
of the Internet in some cases to transfer files, and maintenance
of huge repositories of information which they cannot contribute
to, but which they can allow others to `benefit' from. They feed off
of the `work' of others. For this reason, they are often referred
to as `parasite hackers' or `parasites' by members of their social
communities.
<p>
These are not the only people involved in the epidemiology of malicious
programs. Commercial software companies are involved. At least 64
instances of DOS-based commercial software have been released with
infected files or infected boot sectors. There are increasing numbers
of reports of infections on commercial and shareware CDs released
for DOS based machines [Footnote 2]. Innocent users are sometimes
carriers. We are all familiar with the sneaker net mode of infection.
where an office worker carries a disk to his/her co-worker, and in
transferring the files or booting from the shared disk, also sometimes
transfers the virus. Users can also transfer viruses by not following
proper procedures in their environments; not taking the virus threat
seriously. Anti-virus software is often disabled by users because
it is too slow or not installed at all because the installation is
considered too complex. When this lack of provision for detection
exists, the user can play host and distributor to viruses without
ever being aware of their existence. Administrators also sometimes
play a role in the distribution of viruses and other malicious programs,
unknowingly. This will be discussed further under section 3.1.3 <a href="#SITES">Virus
Distribution Sites</a>.

<h4>3. Epidemiology</h4>
<p>
Having defined some types of programs that are used to cause disruption
and criminal activity in our networks, aspects of cyberspace and technological
development which can contribute to the problem and the general characteristics
of some of the people involved, we will now look at the methods by
which the people distribute the programs and information.
<P>
<a name="TRAVEL">
<b>3.1 How virus programs travel</b>
<p>
Viruses are exchanged and distributed via at least six methods. The
first, the virus exchange BBS, is perhaps the most well known. We
will trace the growth of viruses as a novelty, to the beginnings of
their place in commercial ventures. To discuss the motivations of
the persons involved in each of these individual steps is beyond the
scope of this paper. We will answer the questions: how are the machines
and the technology used as methods of communicating information; what
kind of information is being communicated?
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="VBBS">
<b>3.1.1 Virus Exchange BBS</b>
<p>
One of the common methods utilized by intentional computer virus distributors
is the virus exchange bulletin board. The bulletin boards are similar
in most respects to mainstream bulletin am bulletin board systems. The sotems. The software
used by the indivby the individual system operators varies. Mrs varies. Many of the systems
aresystems
are accessible via teliphone, and some are accessible through telnet.
From a humble beginning in Sofia, Bulgaria (the site of the first
known virus exchange system), virus exchange bulletin boards have
grown into big operaem was operated by Todor Todorov in Sofia Bulgaria; it made
viruses available initially on an `exchange' basis, but later offered
the viruses to anyone who cared to take them. In its initial stage,
it encouraged the creation of new viruses by requiring the upload
of a new virus in exchange for access to any and all viruses. The
system had a total of 294 users and was used primarily by local callers.
The number of &quot;regular&quot; files on this system was at least double
the number of viruses; according to the system operator, the non-virus
files were the most frequently accessed. Following the popularization
of this system via negative publicity as well as ``word of mouth advertising''
by users, other systems began to emerge. Currently, virus exchange
bulletin boards are known to exist in North America, Latin America,
Europe (including Switzerland where it has become a crime to offer
viruses via a BBS; and Holland, where it is also a criminal offense);
Australia, Asia and Africa. The systems sometimes state they are Virus
Research Bulletin Boards. Some of the systems are &quot;private&quot;; others
allow access to anyone who wishes to participate. These individual
systems have led to a new development; that of the virus exchange
network.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="VNETWORKS">
<b>3.1.2 Virus Exchange Networks</b>
<p>
These systems were for the most part well-publicized by word of mouth,
electronic mail and advertising on other systems of the same type.
While hack/phreak systems had been in existence for some time, the
virus exchange phenomenon was a relative latecomer to the underground
scene. Within roughly a three year period, the operators and users
of such systems had formed a relatively small but tightly knit community,
and the formation of organized networks followed. The networks provided
even faster distribution of new viruses to network members. The majority
of these systems operated using regular dial-up modems and a network
structure similar to the Fidonet. The networks have names such as
vX-Net (Virus Exchange Net), NuKEnet (named after the NuKE virus writing
group which founded the network), and MeltNet (an exclusive net which
has never been known to release a virus outside of the network). These
networks have been observed to overlap; often systems will participate
in more than one of the networks. In some cases, the networks will
publicly identify themselves as &quot;Virus Research BBS&quot;, while in
another network they are known by their virus exchange system or virus
distribution affiliated name. One such instance was the Virginia Institute
of Virus Research, which was also known as the Black Axis BBS. This
system was represented in the Fidonet echomail conference as a virus
research center; it was identified in another network as the world
headquarters for the NuKE virus writing group, operating under the
name &quot;The Black Axis&quot;. This is not an isolated instance, but is
perhaps the most well known. The virus exchange systems as exist via
regular dial-up access are easily accessible to users. Since they
are self-administered, they are not usually subject to any form of
external review or assessment.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="SITES">
<b>3.1.3 Virus Distribution Sites</b>
<p>
As interest in viruses grew, the abilities and resources of the virus
writers and distributors grew. Some of the young virus writers became
college aged; access to internet facilities became available. Internet
virus sites became more commonplace, and information about the ever-changing
locations was transferred at the same fast rate as the viruses themselves.
It is not uncommon to find university ftp sites used as virus distribution
sites. This creates a problem for overworked administrators, who in
many cases have no idea what is passing through their systems. How
can we detect these viruses? In some cases they are not directly detectable,
having been encoded by some standard (or non-standard) utility such
as uuencode; in other cases they are archived. Both these methods
make their detection by current scanning methodologies difficult if
not impossible. They are not active in memory, or existing in any
form which a traditional scanner may recognize. In many cases these
are MS-DOS viruses, which are transferred using UNIX machines. They
are often in and out of sites before most administrators know their
systems have been used for the purpose of holding or transferring
the data.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="ROBOTS">
<b>3.1.4 Virus Distribution Robots and File Servers</b>
<p>
Use of automated distribution programs known as bots and servers is
a relatively recent addition to the methods used to distribute viruses.
By contacting one of the servers via electronic mail, or by asking
the `robot' for the files, a user can relatively anonymously retrieve
viruses via the internet. The connection can of course be monitored,
but they do not appear to be routinely monitored by the administrators
or by the users themselves. One recently programmed file server reportedly
transferred to users approximately 15,000 to 20,000 files (viruses
and text files) per week during its three months of operations. There
were approximately 1000 files available for download/transfer from
this server. The operator of the server learned to make and use bots
during his self-taught experience with the Linux operating system.
Following the success of the server, he programmed a bot which was
actively distributing viruses on the Internet Relay Chat. He states
he put the server online to do something that had never been done
before -- internet wide virus distribution. As the server was anonymous,
there is no way to know what sort of users accessed the files, their
intended purpose, or the result of the accessibility.
<p>
According to the server operator, the supplier of internet service
declared a breach of contract following the huge volume of file transfers;
he was forced to remove the server. Such servers, and bots, can be
used for distribution of any type file, not just viruses; this transfer
of information can be accomplished with relative anonymity.

<a name="BOOKS">
<b>3.1.5 Virus Instruction Books</b>
<p>
Books on how to make viruses have become popular, and contests are
sponsored to build the smallest virus; the most politically incorrect
virus; the virus best able to defeat anti-virus programs. In 1990,
Mark Ludwig copyrighted <u>The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses</u>.
This book contained general information about types of viruses. It
contained computer source code for the viruses as well as an order
blank readers could use to order the code on disk; it also contained
what the book refers to as &quot;compiled executable programs for all
of the viruses and related programs in this book&quot;. There was a disclaimer,
requiring the purchaser to assume full responsibility for any damage
that may be caused by any of the programs. The viruses themselves
were not particularly innovative. Several of them have been found
in the wild since the publication of the book. This book created some
controversy, followed by the release of a second book. The second
book was released without much attention in the United States; however,
in France, there was considerable controversy surrounding the release
of the book. The final ruling of the French court on distribution
of this book is not known at this time. There have been other books
published which contain computer virus source code. They have not
achieved the notoriety of the Ludwig book. We are not suggesting any
books should be banned. However, there are ethical considerations
with which computing professionals need to be concerned. We will discuss
these further later in this paper.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="SALE">
<b>3.1.6 Viruses for Sale</b>
<p>
Viruses are offered for sale by individuals. Several such offers were
posted in various Fido and Usenet newsgroups. In addition, some magazines
carry advertisements for viruses. Magazines also offer virus source
code; the sale of these magazines appears to be legal at this time
in the United States. Virus writers and distributors have begun creating
and selling new viruses to some anti-virus product developers for
inclusion in the `scanner' programs. Government and industry sources
have been said to purchase or obtain viruses from virus exchange systems
or virus distributors, to perform testing of the anti-virus software
they are considering. The virus phenomenon has become big business.

<p>
<a name="HACKING">
<b>3.2 How hacking tools travel</b>
<p>
Hacking tools, such as shell scripts which exploit system holes,
buglists, etc. appear to travel via different sorts of paths.
<p>
In the case of these tools, and the people who exchange them,
the scenario appears to alter slightly. The majority of hacking
tools appear to be created after the announcement of a software bug.
Hackers then create tools to exploit the bugs. In some cases, the
hackers themselves find the bugs. There appears to be more creativity,
individual action, and intentional sharing of the information among
hackers than among the virus involved individuals; however, the information
has tended to be limited to those who are judged (within the subculture)
of understanding and contributing to further development of the tools.
In some case, individuals obtain one set of tools and use them to
obtain others by simply taking them from the filesystems of the tool
developers.
<p>
Primarily they have been shared amongst individuals in the relatively
tightly knit hacking community, until recently. We are now beginning
to observe a shift which is cause for concern:
<p>
<ul>
<LI>Hackers sharing programs ---&gt; Hackers sharing programs
<LI>Shared among a small group ---&gt; Shared among small groups
<LI>Not widely distributed ---&gt; Distributed more widely; wide-banded;
<LI>Not generally used maliciously ---&gt; Used maliciously;
</ul>
<p>
This shift can be observed by following the distribution of one hacking
tool commonly know as the sunsniffer. Initially the sniffer was distributed
only to a very few people. The source code and executable code for
this sniffer were recently `&quot;widebanded&quot;. Widebanding refers to indiscriminate
intentional distribution of a program, through every available method.
In some cases this is done to make tracing of the original distributor
more difficult.
<p>
The sniffer, which compromised the security of large number of systems
on the internet, worked by using a feature of the operating system
called /dev/nit. This is the  network interface tap, and it can read/write
from/to different interfaces. The program was configured to place
/dev/nit in promiscuous mode, because it could then read all traffic
from any machine on the cable, even routed mail. Administrators who
had not properly configured their own /dev/nit helped enable the compromise
of their own systems. However, this &quot;hole&quot; was designed into the
system, making this compromise possible. It is not feasible to disable
a machine to prevent its compromise.
<p>
As people became more aware of the use of this program by a few individuals,
the potential for apprehension of the individuals increased, so the
tool was distributed a bit more widely. At the same time, other individuals
began to find this &quot;sniffer&quot; on machines which had been compromised;
they would then take a copy of it to use elsewhere. Copies of the
sunsniffer were placed on publicly available FTP sites, where any
user with access to anonymous FTP could obtain the program. The shift
we are observing whereby hackers are distributing information such
as this on a much wider scale than before is illustrated by the speed
and manner of the distribution of this sniffer.
<p>
What has brought about this shift? As suggested earlier, technology
can bring about an ethic of its own that is not necessarily in keeping
with the ethic of the creators of the technology. While this can be
said of virtually any technology, it appears to be particularly applicable
in the case of computing technologies. This will be further discussed
in section 5., <a href="#FUTURE">Future Trends</a>, in which we will examine some of
the reasons for the shifts we are observing.
<p>
Recently, there have been more hacker voices calling for public dissemination
of both operating system holes and fixes. There are diversified opinions
in both communities regarding whether or not such information distribution
would benefit either of the communities in regards to their respective
goals. Whether or not this idea gains widespread acceptance in either
community remains to be seen.

<b>3.2.1 Private BBS</b>
<p>
While private BBS are set up, offering some tools, these tools tend
to be of relatively minor significance: war-dialers, phreaking information,
information easily available about operating systems. Some BBS do
contain more technically advanced materials, but access to them appears
to be more exclusive than is the case with virus exchange bulletin
board systems. Most of the information on h/p/a/v (hacking, phreaking,
anarchy and virus) systems is of lower quality; most of the tools
found are said to be trivial.

<b>3.2.2 Networked BBS</b>

exist do not appear to offer the more exclusive tools.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="USENET">
<b>3.2.3 Usenet</b>
<p>
An interesting aspect of hacking tools is the use of Usenet news for
their distribution. Source code for hacking tools appears on various
Usenet groups, but usually this is after hackers have had access to
them for some time. Such source code can be saved by readers, and
compiled to create tools such as shell scripts to install port hoppers,
and so on; It has been our experience in talking with a number of
persons who have arrived relatively recently into the `hacking scene'
that they are not capable of using these tools. The problem usually
appears to be the necessity to modify the programs for different
platforms; these people simply do not possess the ability to do it.
Another problem is the apriori technical knowledge required. It does
little good for a hacker to have a device that exploits a bug in kmem,
for instance, if he does not know what to do once he has access to
kmem. Simple programs for altering utmp files require modification
as simple as directory paths; frequently, people do not have even
the skills to do this. Commonly, such persons will access a UNIX system
and enter DOS commands such as DIR, or type HELP.
<p>
This is not to say that the tools are not useful in helping them to
learn; however, it is clear that these tools require more than a casual
knowledge of the systems they are intended for use on. As the toolkits
become more developed, less skill is required on the part of the users.
However, some basic knowledge is still required.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<A NAME="FTP">
<b>3.2.4 FTP Sites</b>
<p>
The use of Usenet for distribution of such tools is not the only way
the Internet is used to facilitate the travel of hacking tools. FTP
sites are routinely used for drop sites. These in many cases require
special accesses or passwords, but in some cases tools are left on
public sites, either through oversight on the part of the individuals
involved, or intentionally.

<h4>4. Social Factors</h4>
<p>
The connection between certain aspects of current computing technology
and the crimes/activities being facilitated will be examined, with
emphasis on the paradigm shifts which have been proven to improve
the overall health of other forms of scientific research.
<p>
<A NAME="FACILITATOR">
<H4>4.1 Cyberspace as facilitator</h4>
<p>
We will now consider the aspect of this cyberspace environment known
as dehumanization. Not all computing technologies are heavily influenced
by the dehumanization and other psychological aspects of `cyberspace'
which are seen in the environment surrounding the `malicious computer
program', but it should not surprise us that people who have little
contact with other human beings due to their intense immersion in
the electronic communities we have designed have lost sight of their
humanity. It follows that the impact of their actions is often seen,
at least by them, as impacting machines, not other human beings.
<p>
We should also consider the aspects of cyberspace which facilitate
inequality, and the possible results of these inequalities. This environment
is no different than in any other aspect of society; it is normal
for people to be unequal. For example, we do not all have access to
the same quality of health care; not everyone has even a house in
which to put a terminal. Cyberspace however, introduces a unique form
of inequality in that the sort of information which is becoming available
will provide what could be a very extreme advantage to those who `have'
versus those who `have not' -- indeed, this advantage/disadvantage
could impact the electronic community in such a way that the community
could become unable to maintain itself entirely. Unequal access to
information puts those who do not have the access at the distinct
disadvantage of ever being able to fulfill their potential in the
electronic society. While this is inherent in most societies, we are
in a position now which could enable us to minimalize some aspects
of social inequality by careful planning and policy making. Unlike
other areas, this structure is not yet intact; there is still time
to integrate equalizing factors. Most importantly, we need to consider
what sorts of information belong in cyberspace; what sort of access
policies should governments envision; is the idea of access for everyone
feasible or even desirable.
<p>
At this time, cyberspace does tend to facilitate some inequality;
this inequality is manifested in the number of `victims'. It can be
argued that there is a great equalization, due to lack of real world
visual biases or clues inherent in net communication and interaction;
however, it is important to consider that along with the lack of the
visual `bias' triggers comes a lack of contextual clues. Without these
clues, often people do not realise their behaviour is unacceptable.
If it is alright to do one little thing, another little thing is added
to it. Eventually, you can end up with a very anti-social behavior,
which was totally acceptable every step of the way by one's peer group.
This is not to suggest that we should find a way to take real-time,
real-space clues and integrate them into net societies. As users are
given more and more power, the potential for trickery, lies, deceit
and abuse increases right along with the potential for `good'. It
may be wise to consider the nature of cyber-societies and the processes
of social influence within them. [Sproull, 93]

<A NAME="ENABLER">
<b>4.2 Technology as enabler</b>
<p>
In addition to the people, we must consider the part the systems and
technology play in the spread of this sort of data. We can best do
this by drawing a parallel with one of the more well known scientific
paradigms, noting the similarities with the problem we now face:
<p>
<blockquote>
Medical Science in the early 1960s:
<ul>
<LI>We can do it
<LI>We should do it
<LI>We must do it
</ul>
<p>
Communication Technology Today:
<ul>
<LI>We can do it
<LI>We should do it
<LI>We must do it
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The &quot:it" in the first case refers to advances in medicine relating
to health care, and research; in particular fields such as genetic
engineering. What occurred during this time was a remarkable advancement
of technology which left scientists and researchers in somewhat of
a quandary over exactly what, and how much, of this research and development
should be put into common usage or pursued at all. We find a similar
situation today, with computing technologies not only surpassing the
abilities of administrators and users to understand them, but of the
technologies themselves at times enabling their own destruction. It
is perhaps wise to consider at some point what safeguards we should
require. In the 60's, science turned to the field of ethics -- a field
which was dying according to some -- and asked the question &quot;Just
what exactly should we do? What is -right- to do?&quot;. From this introspection,
the field of bio-ethics emerged. [Bartels, Smith, 93] [Gustafson, 70]
<P>
When we look at medical science, and medical research today, we find
questions being asked:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Medical Science Paradigm today :
<p>
<ul>
<LI>We can do it
<LI>Should we do it?
<LI>How should we do it?
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
We can observe the shifts resulting from the interaction with ethical
concerns. This shift has meant perhaps less scientific `advancement',
but perhaps has placed medical science more in line with its true
goals. The same could be said for integration of ethics with other
scientific disciplines. As the technologies of computing today advance,
they tend to focus on what the machines can do. In this assumption,
we could be neglecting what we really need and want them to do.
<P>

<p>
<A NAME="FUTURE">
<h4>5. Future Trends</h4>
<p>
The technologies described to this point which have enabled the sorts
of crimes we are now seeing in our global computing environments were
surely not created or designed to facilitate these sorts of behaviours.
We must, however, take a serious look at contributory factors.
<p>
It could be the case that we have simply allowed technology to progress
too quickly, with insufficient planning. This is not to suggest that
we should stifle technology, but that we may need to begin now to
pay particular attention to the ethical model that the technological
model is generating. As an example, consider FSP and FTP applications.
We have seen how FTP (File Transfer Protocol via connection state
protocol) can in some cases allow files to be transferred anonymously.
This is a good and necessary thing, and its potential for abuse or
misuse could be minimized by correct configuration policies. FSP,
or File Server Protocol (Transfers via Connection list) in which you
have a connection only during pings, requests, etc. are an improvement
in that you do not tie up resources during inactivity; however, use
of FSP usually requires no special privileges to set up and no special
ports; it doesn't require separate file systems, and anyone can set
up this sort of `server'. We are seeing the same sorts of problems
with these FSP servers as we are seeing with the DCC (Direct Client
to Client transfer services) applications and Bots that are being
used to transfer viruses and other programs on IRC (Internet Relay
Chat).
<P>
The anonymity of both of these applications plays a role in the ethical
models of behaviour that have developed around their uses. While FTP
sites are used to transfer the sorts of programs and information with
which we are concerned, there appears to be a much higher incidence
of FSP sites being used on a regular basis to transfer this information
and data. The controversy surrounding anonymity and pseudo-anonymity
is one which will probably continue for a long time as we learn the
effects of such freedoms. However, what we can see now is that these
sorts of anonymous applications do provide almost a &quot;Use Me for Your
Own Purposes&quot; sign.
<p>
Other technologies which have had huge influence on society have developed
relatively slowly, enabling us to at least somewhat predict future
trends; however, in the case of computing technology, not only do
we have few precedents on which to build our analysis, the technology
by nature is rather esoteric. This creates an environment perfectly
adapted to the development of pseudo-revolutionary counter culture
and the exploitation of those who have, or are perceived to have,
power. Additionally, the trends which we are able to predict would
seem to indicate that legal methods of redress are inadequate at best.
A proactive approach to the problems facing us as relating to hacking,
virus writing/distribution and dissemination of information which
has the deliberate design of being used in a harmful or malicious
way would have to include ethics and education. The types of ethics
and education will be discussed briefly in the next section, <a href="#SOLUTIONS">Solutions</a>.
<p>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p>
<A NAME="SOLUTIONS">
<h4>6. Solutions</h4>
<p>
Both legal and ethical solutions to some of the problems discussed
in this paper are worth considering. However, both have limitations,
and need to be used in a cooperative, or multidisciplinary approach.
We will look now at some of the methods we can use to address the
problems.
<p>
<A NAME="LAWS">
<b>6.1 Laws</b>
<p>
Laws are one method. There are however, problems with laws addressing
computer viruses, virus source code, and hacking `tools'. As evidenced
by the recent cases involving members of a well known `hacker' group,
jurisdiction can be a problem. In one particular case, the alleged
perpetrator physically resided in the United States; the system he
reportedly attacked was located in Australia. The question of jurisdiction
has, to this point, made prosecution impossible. [Cook, 93]
<p>
Laws concerning viruses have problems due to their lack of enforceability,
jurisdiction and the matter of recovery. As we have shown, the nature
of the methods of exchanging computer viruses and hacking tools tend
to hamper any real assessment of exactly how much information is being
exchanged and by whom. While of course there are ample mechanisms
for monitoring information exchanges, we need to be concerned with
various policies (both legal and ethical) when we consider monitoring
communications to ensure their `acceptability'. The vast majority
of known virus writers are not capable of providing recovery should
they actually be convicted of a crime, successfully prosecuted, and
found guilty. Finally, there is the international nature of virus
distribution, which adds to the already complicated situation.
<P>
While courts have usually found that information distributors are
not strictly liable for damage caused by distribution of misinformation,
recent decisions have held that distributors of products can be held
strictly liable for the results of reliance on misinformation contained
in the product (Cook, 93). The United States Commerce Department,
in January 1990, found that International system administrators have
an affirmative obligation to review the contents of their systems
to locate improper or illegal traffic, specifically traffic in programs
which have controlled export under the Export Administration Act or
the Arms Export Control Act. While laws are still evolving and no
one knows for sure what the end result will be, it seems safe to assume
that administrators and commercial system owners will eventually face
possible liabilities for actions of their users, such as virus infected
products, viruses distributed via networks, stolen credit card information
transferred via their networks, users businesses disrupted because
adequate safeguards were not in place. This however does not solve
the problem. The administrators may have a responsibility ethically
and perhaps eventually legally to know what is going on on their systems;
however, we cannot ignore the obvious gap between what a system should
enforce and what it is actually expected to enforce. We must also
be cognizant of the gap between what we can expect will be enforced
the social policies and mores that exist in any given environment
[Neumann, 93].
<p>
The concept of Free Speech as a Constitutional Right is invoked by
many proponents of unrestricted virus &quot;exchange&quot; in the United States.
There are forms of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment
to the United States Constitution; additionally, there are precedents
which bring serious questions to the First Amendment defense. The
virus problem is not confined to the United States alone, and any
laws specific to any individual country may not be applicable in another
country. The discussion of free speech and/or First Amendment rights
is beyond the scope of this paper; it is mentioned due to its large
role in the defense of virus writing in the United States.
<p>
Finally, we may wish to examine ways in which laws can be used to
create positive ethical models in individuals and groups. First, quoting
a release from the Technical and General Assemblies of the International
Federation for Information Processing [see Footnote 3]]
<p>
<blockquote>
In view of the potentially serious and even fatal consequences of
the introduction of `virus' programs into computer systems, the Technical
and General Assemblies of IFIP urge:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>all computer professionals to recognize the disastrous potential
of computer viruses;
<LI>all computer educators to impress upon their students the dangers
of virus programs.
<LI>all publishers to refrain from publication of the details of actual
virus programs;
</OL>
</blockquote>
<P>
We see a very good suggestion as to how we may begin to positively
influence students and young people. We can observe how this has been
seen to work in the past by looking at the issue of drinking and driving.
At one point in time, drinking and driving was a personal issue. As
we as a society began to see some of the consequences of this interaction,
we began to pass laws which restricted the such behaviour. There was
some resistance to this type of law initially, which people saw as
an infringement on their right to drink alcohol and drive their vehicles.
However, as the law became more widely accepted, people began to refuse
to drink and drive on the principle that it is `wrong' to do. Policymakers
and lawmakers are very aware of this form of societal control. However,
they are often not very aware of the societal structure of `cyberspace',
and for this reason there is the danger that laws they make will not
create the desired ethical model, but will instead create a backlash
or revolutionary movement against the society. By continuing to take
time to develop realistic policies and effective laws, it is possible
we can avoid such a backlash.
<P>
<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a>
<p><A NAME="ETHICAL">
<b>6.2 Ethical considerations</b>
<p>
The ethical approach to addressing these concerns is one worth further
consideration. What role does ethics currently play in our computing
environments? What role, if any, should it play? Ethics is quite the
`in' word, and is often promoted as the be-all and end-all solution
to all the problems we face dealing with virus and malicious software distribution. Ethics, however, cannot and should not be seen as a `behaviour regulator'. It is not
a drug one can force down someone's throat, and cure them of their
&quot;disease&quot;. If we are to use ethics to help us to solve some of the
problems discussed in this paper, where and how should we begin? There
are several areas of immediate concern.
<p>
Commonly, ethics is promoted, if at all, in our computing environments
as something related to individual action. While ethics certainly
can be important in matters of our interpersonal actions and subsequently
on our actions as they impact the society, we seem to ignore the issues
of ethical evaluation of institutions (Ladd, 93).
<p>
Questions related to distributive justice (here, I refer to rights
in the sense of both negative and positive rights; specifically, what
can I expect to do free from any infringement from government or individuals,
and what duty does my society have to provide me with access, freedoms,
security, development and distribution of resources), and other ethics
of management are worthy of consideration.
<p>
There have been voices calling for more clearly defined professional
ethics and more involvement of professional societies in defining
and promoting `professional ethics'. Considering ethics is by nature
a reflective, critical field, it would seem that while ethical norms
may be documented, to assume we can arrive at some `ethical statement
of principle' is somewhat unrealistic. Ethics are not laws, rules,
policies or agreements. It is not something one can put on from the
outside. Of course, ethics can and should play a role in creation
of codes of conduct. Such codes of conduct are necessary and important
tools in imparting behavioural guidelines to others [Forrester, Morrison
94]. We must be careful not to confuse codes of conduct, which are
based on ethical principles, with ethics themselves. If we do not
take care, we are subject to a slippery slope where we may believe
that we are somehow `above' the ethical principles we apply to others.
This can create a hypocrisy which only exacerbates the problems
that are created by other factors, as outlined in this paper. The
development of codes of behaviour is often looked to as one ethical
solution. This may be a factor in showing individuals what is acceptable,
but cannot be viewed as a method for instilling ethical behaviour
in any group.
<P>
Another concern is what type of &quot;ethics&quot; should we look to for help
in understanding and solving the problems of malicious program distribution.
Is it the ethical theory itself that we must reintegrate into the
educational system? According to the ACM/IEEE-CS Curriculum Task Force,
undergraduate programs need to &quot;prepare students to understand the
field of computing both as an academic discipline and as a profession
within the context of a larger society&quot;. One of the main goals is
cited as exposing students to the &quot;ethical and societal issues that
are associated with the computing field.&quot; The question of whether
this instruction should consist of ethical theory or application is
prominent. One school of thought is that we need to teach ethical
applications now, before the problem gets any worse. Another view
is that teaching ethical theory will allow us to develop ethical
applications which will continue to develop as the technology develops.

<A NAME="CONCLUSION">
<h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
<p>
When a new technology emerges , a paradigm associated with that technology
appears or is borrowed from an associated technology. As the technology
develops towards maturity, the paradigm shapes its development. At
certain points, it becomes apparent that the paradigm is no longer
appropriate, and a paradigm shift occurs. Typically this is first
seen as an outlandish if not heretical move by some maverick individual.
But if the shift is appropriate, it becomes adopted by the scientific
community, and then serves to shape or even control the further development
of the technology. Without such paradigm shifts, the technology may
become stagnated, or even dangerously out of touch with its aims and
the society around it. Computer science is no exception.
<p>
I have argued above that we are now at the point where a significant
paradigm shift is necessary in this area. The speed with which global
electronic communication is developing has brought with it an enormous
benefit to all those fortunate enough to be able to exploit it. It
has also brought opportunities to those who are willing to abuse it.
The way in which it has introduced relative and absolute anonymity
to its users itself may encourage acts which would otherwise have
appeared to be too risky to the perpetrator. That is, its very nature
may encourage various kinds of antisocial activities, ranging from
innocent pranks through serious malicious damage to data and individuals
to downright criminal fraud. The speed and power of the technology
itself enables these activities to take place, and encourages them.
Since its principle users are relatively young, and may be impressionable
or unprincipled, an ethos has developed in which it is `cool' to be
an outlaw. Moreover, the inherent power embodied in being able to
control the `system' is itself potentially irresistibly attractive.
<p>
It is natural, given the way that societies tend to develop, that
antisocial or otherwise undesirable activities lead to legislation
against them, designed to contain or eradicate them. This is the point
we have reached with such excesses on the Internet. This is the current
paradigm of control, and the one that is influencing the development
of the technology. However, legislation is notorious for not solving
the problems it is designed to deal with. A paradigm shift is now
necessary, both in the way the technology develops further and in
the way that malicious activities associated with it are combatted.
The problem of internet abuse cannot be solved by trying to legislate
it out of existence. It is necessary to promote an ethical approach
to computing. This itself requires there to be an ethical model of
developing computer science. The paradigm for this technology can
no longer be determined purely along scientific lines. Introducing
ethics into the way the technology is used will help to instill appropriate
ethics in the users of the technology, and thus to reduce the numbers
of abusers. If this program is successful, it will soon sound outdated
and even `lame' to say &quot;it's ok to do it if it isn't illegal&quot;, just
as it has become `uncool' to drink and drive; not merely illegal,
but unethical, and not the sort of thing that enchances the image
and status of a potential role model.
<P>
We cannot eliminate the social aspects of malicious computer program
development and distribution through solely legal means, or through
solely technical means. We can look to technology for detection in
some cases, and to law for prosecution or relief in some cases. In
all cases, resources to enable us to emphasise and integrate ethical
computing behaviours in all areas -- not just in areas relating to
viruses and hacking -- may provide a stablizing influence. Our computing
environments are very vulnerable regarding distribution of information
-- after all, it is what they were designed to do. I suggest that
we need to focus somewhat more on what we were designed to do: to
behave as rational self-policing beings and to impart this ethical
model to people learning the technology. Without the proper interaction
of laws, education and ethical development, there is a very real risk
that this technology will soon become unusable and ultimately self-destructive.
