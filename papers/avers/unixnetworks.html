<h2>1. ABSTRACT</h2>
</center>
Unix systems are as susceptible to hostile software attacks as any
other system, however, the Unix community is zealous in their believe
that they are immune.  This belief is in the face of historical
reality.  The first computer viruses created were on Unix systems.
The Internet Worm, Trojan Horses and Logic Bombs are all ignored
milestones in this belief.  Not withstanding these beliefs, there is a
growing concern among computer security professionals about these
problems.  This concern is based on recognition of the complex nature
of the problem and the increasing value of Unix based networks.
Whereas, the Internet Worm disrupted the Internet in 1988 the cost was
relativity low.  If this attack is repeated today, the cost will be
very high because of the new found importance of the Internet,
electronic business networks using EDI and private networks, all of
which are Unix based.
<p>
Traditional methods used against attacks in other operating system
environments such as MS-DOS are insufficient in the more complex
environment provided by Unix.  Additionally, Unix provides a special
and significant problem in this regard due to its open and
heterogeneous nature.  These problems are expected to become both more
common and pronounced as 32 bit multitask network operating systems
such as Microsoft NT become popular.  Therefore, the problems
experienced today are good indicators of the problems and the
solutions that will be experienced in the future, no matter which
operating system becomes predominate.
<p>
<center>
<h2>2. THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM AND ITS NATURE</h2>
</center>
<p>
The problem of software attacks exists in all operating systems.
These attacks follow different forms according to the function of the
attack.  In general, all forms of attack contain a method of self
preservation which may be propagation or migration and a payload.  The
most common method of self preservation in Unix is obscurity.  If the
program has an obscure name or storage location, then it may avoid
detection until after its payload has had the opportunity to execute.
Computer worms preserve themselves by migration while computer viruses
use propagation.  Trojan horses, logic bombs and time bombs protect
themselves by obscurity.
<p>
While the hostile algorithms that have captured the general public's
imagination are viruses and worms, the more common direct problem on
Unix systems are Trojan horses and time bombs.  A Trojan horse is a
program that appears to be something it is not.  An example of a
Trojan horse is a program that appears to be a calculator or other
useful utility which has a hidden payload of inserting a back door
onto its host system.  A simple Trojan horse can be created by
modifying any source code with the addition of a payload.  One of the
most favorite payloads observed in the wild is &quot;/bin/rm -rf /
&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1&quot; This payload will attempt to remove
all accessible files on the system as a background process with all
messages redirected to waste disposal.  Since system security is lax
at many sites, there are normally thousands of files with permission
bit settings of octal 777.  All files on the system with this
permission setting will be removed by this attack.  Additionally, all
files owned by the user, their group or anyone else on the system
whose files are write accessible to the user will be removed.  This
payload is not limited to use by Trojan horses but can be utilized by
any form of attack.  Typically, a time bomb can be created by using
the &quot;cron&quot; or &quot;at&quot; utilities of the Unix system to
execute this command directly at the specified time.
<p>
While the bin remove payload is a favorite of many authors, there are
other traditional attacks which are not as overt in their destruction.
These other attacks are more important because they bend the operation
of the system to the purposes of the attacker while not revealing
themselves to the system operator.  Attacks of this form include the
appending of an account record to the password file, copying the
password file to an off site email address for leisurely cracking and
modification of the operating system to include back doors or cause
the transfer of money or property.  It is extremely simple to email
valuable information off site in such a manner as to insure that the
recipient cannot be traced or located.  Some of these methods are path
dependent, however, the path selected is at the discretion of the
attacker.
<p>
One of the most simple methods of inserting a back door is the well
known suid bit shell attack.  In this attack, a trojanized program is
used to copy a shell program to an accessible directory.  The shell
program is then set with permission bits that allow it to execute with
the userid and permission of its creator.  A simple one line suid bit
shell attack can be created by adding the following command to a
user's &quot;.login&quot; or any other file that they execute.
Example: cp /bin/sh /tmp/gotu ; chmod 4777 /tmp/gotu
<p>
Trojan horses and time bombs can be located using the same methods
required to locate viruses in the Unix environment.  There are many
technical reasons why these forms of attack are not desirable, the
foremost being their immobility.  A virus or worm attack is more
important because these programs are mobile and can integrate
themselves into the operating system.  Of these two forms of attack,
the virus attack is the hardest to detect and has the best chance of
survival.  Worms can be seen in the system process tables and
eliminated since they exist as individual processes while virus
attacks are protected from this form of detection by their host
programs.  All of the methods used to detect and prevent viruses are
also effective against the other forms of attack, therefore, the
remainder of this paper will deal with the more serious problem of
viral attacks.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>3. UNIX VIRUS ATTACKS</h2>
<p></center>
The promotion of the concept of &quot;magical immunity&quot; to
computer viral attacks surfaces on a regular basis.  This concept,
while desirable, is misleading and dangerous since it tends to mask a
real threat.  Opponents of the possibility of viral attacks in Unix
state that hardware instructions and operating system concepts such as
supervisor mode or permission settings, security ratings like C2 or B1
provide protection.  These ideas have been proven wrong by real life.
The use of supervisor mode, the additional levels of protection
provided by C2 and the mandatory access control provided by security
level B1 are not necessary for viral activity and are therefore moot
as a method of protection.  This fact is supported by the existence of
viruses that infect Unix systems as both scripts and binary.
<p>
In fact, virus attacks against Unix systems will eventually become
more popular as simpler forms of attack become obsolete.  Computer
viruses have significantly more virility, methods of protection and
opportunity for infection.  Methods of protection have been highly
refined in viruses, including rapid reproduction by infection,
migration though evaluation of its environment, (boot viruses look for
uninfected floppy diskettes) armor, stealth and polymorphism.  In
addition, the host system itself becomes a method of protection and
propagation.  Virus infected files are protected just as much by the
operating system as are non-infected files.  Introduction of viruses
into systems have also been refined using technology called
&quot;droppers&quot;.  A dropper is a Trojan horse that has a virus or
viruses as a payload.  Finally, extensive networking technology such
as NFS (Network File System) allows viruses to migrate between systems
without effort.
<p>
All of these reasons point to viruses as the future of hostile
algorithms, however, the most significant reason for this
determination is the effectiveness of the virus as a form of attack.
Past experiments by Doctor Fred Cohen [1984] used a normal user
account on a Unix system, without privileged access, and gained total
security penetration in 30 minutes.  Doctor Cohen repeated these
results on many versions of Unix, including AT&amp;T Secure Unix and
over 20 commercial implementations of Unix.  The results have been
confirmed by independent researchers worldwide.  Separate experiments
by Tom Duff [1989] demonstrated the tenacity of Unix viruses even in
the face of disinfectors.  The virus used in Mr. Duff's experiment was
a simple virus written in script.  The virus was believed to have been
reintroduced by the operating system from the automated backup and
restore system.  Reinfection took place after the system had been
virus free for one year.
<p><center>
<h2>4. HETEROGENEOUS VIRUS ATTACKS</h2>
<p></center>
I have observed non-Unix personal computers attached to a
heterogeneous network that were infected with computer viruses
originating from Unix servers [1987].  The Unix systems were not the
original point of entry for the viruses.  They were dormant while on
the Unix systems but became harmful when they migrated to their target
systems.  The Unix systems acted as unaffected carriers of computer
viruses for other platforms.  For the sake of simplicity, I have named
this effect after an historical medical problem of similar nature,
&quot;Typhoid Mary Syndrome&quot; [1991].  Networks and specifically
Unix servers that provide network file systems are very susceptible to
this problem.
<p>
I first observed this problem while investigating an infection of
personal computers attached to a network with a large population of
Unix servers and workstations.  The virus was manually attacked on the
personal computers using virus scanners.  During the infection period
all of the personal computers were disconnected from the network and
idle.  Once all the computers were disinfected, all removable media
was tested and the infection was unobserved for a period of time, the
computers were reattached to the network.  A few weeks later, a test
of the computers using the same virus scanner indicated they had
become reinfected with the same viruses.  The source of infection was
then identified as repositories of executables stored on the Unix file
servers.
<p>
These repositories were organically grown centralized resources for
all the personal computers because the Unix servers were effective at
providing these shared services via NFS.  In retrospect, this problem
had to exist.  The use of networked systems that were exported from
the Unix platforms provided an easy, powerful method of transferring
data, including executables.  Some network designs provide all third
party software from a network disk for ease of maintenance and reduced
storage requirements.  This easy access provides an open door for
viruses.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>5. TRANSPLATFORM VIRUSES ATTACK UNIX</h2>
<p></center>
During late 1994 and early 1995, I observed multiple instances of at
least three transplatform virus attacks on Unix systems.  All of these
attacks involved MS-DOS viruses that attacked PC based Unix systems.
The first attack involved a virus that corrupted the Unix file system
every night.  The attack was located using a virus scanner and
indicated a Unix binary that was executed at midnight by cron.  The
MS-DOS virus had become embedded in the Unix executable where it was
executed.  The virus did not perform as designed in that the
corruption was the result of the virus attempting to infect other
files and was not an intended effect.  The virus was reinstalled every
morning when the system was restored.  The second attack involved an
MS-DOS virus that executed and was successful in infecting other
files.  Once again, the file system corrupted but it took longer in
duration, thereby allowing the virus to propagate.  The final
infection involved a boot sector virus.  Since this type of virus
executes prior to the loading of the operating system , the
differences between Unix and MS-DOS are moot.  The PC-BIOS and
processor chips are the same in both cases and the virus is able to
execute according to design.  In fact, two different viruses were
observed performing in this way.  The first virus was spread by an
MS-DOS setup diskette while the second virus was transmitted using a
still undiscovered method.  While we observed no boot sector
infections of PC based Unix systems during 1994, we received reports
from system administrators who were requesting information on our Unix
anti-virus product because they had experienced hundreds of infections
during 1995.  In one instance, a single multinational company lost its
entire international network overnight.  The estimated cost in lost
time, resources, and sales was in the millions of dollars.
<p>
Once it is understood that the BIOS and processor functions are the
same for both operating systems, it is very easy to see how a
transplatform virus could be designed by intention.  The virus would
be able to process correctly by inspecting the operating system using
only common BIOS calls and then modify its basic behavior using a
simple &quot;if&quot; structure.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>6. TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES OF PROTECTION AND THEIR FAILURE</h2>
<p></center>
There are three traditional categories of protection, none of which
provide complete or significant protection as stand-alone methods of
implementation.  The categories are Control, Inspection and Integrity.
Each of these methods has traditionally been used separately.
<p>
Control has been the primary intent of the U.S. national standards on
computer security.  They deal with the control of access to the
system, its functions, resources and the ability to move or share data
in the system.  These national standards are codified in a library
generally referred to as the Rainbow series.  (The name was given
because the books have different color covers making a library shelf
look like a rainbow.)  While these standards are a valuable and
important aspect of computer security, they do not provide a deterrent
against software attack.  A virus is an effective way of gaining
control over a system, even a highly controlled system such as a B1
rated version of Unix.  In this case, control does not provide
protection against software attacks because of the viruses' ability to
change permission sets with each new owner that is infected.  A virus
attack gains access to multiple users through shared files.  Access
control is designed to allow the sharing of files.  The ability to
share files is a basic need of the user and cannot be eliminated
without destroying the usefulness of the system.  Discretionary Access
Control (DAC) is not protection against software attacks because it is
a weak form of protection that can be bypassed and, as discretionary,
is at the control of the end users who very often ignore it.  Sites
where the majority of the files on the system have no DAC protection
are normal.  (Many Unix sites have permission bit settings of 777
which allow anyone to read, write, execute or modify the file.)
Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) also has little effect on virus
activity for the same reasons, although MAC can be configured to be
neither weak nor easy to bypass.  Each time a virus attacks an
executable file owned by a different user, it takes on the full
privileges of that user, including access to files of other users
whose permissions intersect the DAC and MAC permission sets of the
infected user.  On all systems, the need to share files forces the
creation of users who exist in multiple permission sets.  This
multiple membership allows viruses to move between MAC compartments
and levels.  The reduction of multiple membership users will slow the
advance of a virus but will not eliminate it.  Finally, once a virus
gains access to an operator account (root, operator, isso) it cannot
be stopped by any form of control.
<p>
Inspection is the traditional way of locating both known holes in
operating systems and in locating known viruses.  The key word here is
&quot;known&quot;.  System audit tools such as COPS, SATAN and others
can only locate holes that are known to them.  Virus scanners can only
locate viruses that are known to them.  This means that a virus
scanner or inspection tool is obsolete even before it is shipped from
the factory.  It can only deal with the past, never the present or
future since conditions searched for must exist at the time of
coding. Virus scanner have to be constantly updated.  This is becoming
a problem with the explosion of viruses being created by new authors
and virus computer aided design and manufacturing tools (V-CAD/CAM).
<p>
It has been proposed that audit tools such as COPS can be used to
deter virus infections because they strengthen the system's ability to
control access and data movement.  These inspection tools only improve
control.  As stated, control does not provide protection against virus
attacks.  It attempts to keep outside people out and inside people
within their areas of authorization.
<p>
The third category of protection is Integrity.  Integrity systems are
intended to detect change.  In the MS-DOS world, early integrity
systems used cyclic redundancy character, CRC, values to detect
change.  A virus was then created which countered this protection.
The virus determined the CRC value of the target file, infected it,
and then padded the file until the CRC value computed the same.  Many
Unix users still use this method of change detection, or worse, they
attempt to use the date of last modification as an indication of
change.  The date of last modification can be changed to any value on
Unix systems with a simple user command.  On many systems an option of
the &quot;touch&quot; command provides this ability.
<p>
Any integrity tool that does not use cryptographic methods is of
little value.  In fact, if the integrity system fails to detect
critical changes, then the false sense of security created in the
system operator can be devastating to the system.  CyberSoft created
an integrity tool, CIT, using the RSA Associates MD5 cryptographic
hash algorithm.  Since the algorithm is cryptographic, it can detect
even a single bit flip and cannot be misled by any known means.  In
addition, during the development of CIT, it was determined that it was
necessary to detect additions and deletions to the file system since
these could be indications of non-infectious attacks such as performed
by Trojan horses, worms and hackers.  In this way, a rolling baseline
can be created that will allow the system operator to quickly recover
from any form of file system attack.  Modifications to the protected
file system created by unauthorized users or software attacks can be
detected and removed.  Using a tool of this type allows the
administrator to locate the approximate time of attack since the
modification will have taken place between two known timed events, the
last and current execution of the integrity tool.  Finally, integrity
tools can be used to determine if a third party file has been modified
or tampered with prior to use.  Some manufacturers of Unix operating
systems now publish MD5 digests of their systems.  Using these
digests, it is possible to determine that the file on your system is
exactly as it should be.  There was no degradation from misreading the
installation media, deterioration of the disk system or intentional
modification.  If a manufacturer does not publish a list, then end
users can create their own by installing an operating system on
multiple systems from different media sources.  The created digests of
each system should agree.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>7. NONTRADITIONAL CATEGORIES OF PROTECTION AND THEIR FAILURE</h2>
<p></center>
In the past, fencing systems were sold as a popular method of virus
protection on PC platforms.  A fencing system write protects parts of
the disk using a hardware board that is added to the system bus.
Since a virus cannot infect a file that is write protected using
hardware, it appears to be a good method.  The obvious drawback is
that the user cannot write to the disk if it is write protected.  The
fencing system therefore had to create zones of protection so that the
user could perform useful work.  Viruses happily infected the
unprotected zones.  Fencing systems appear to have never been marketed
for Unix systems.  CyberSoft did provide fencing as a custom solution
to an Internet service provider a few years ago.  We suggested that
their boot disk have the write enable line cut and a shunt installed.
The operating system was installed and logical links were created for
all files that required constant modification to a second write
enabled disk.  This method has been very successful against hacker
attacks.  The service provider has never had a write protected file
modified by an attack.  Many people have tried but the method has
stood the test of time.  This implementation method also suffers from
the problem of zones of protection.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>8. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE METHODS OF PROTECTION</h2>
<p></center>
CyberSoft, Inc. manufactures the first and oldest [1991] product in
this category.  The product is called VFind and runs on most Unix
systems.  Since I have not studied the other products available for
Unix, I will deal with the product that I am qualified to discuss,
VFind.
<p>
The VFind product provides protection in all three categories.  It
provides Control by supplying the COPS audit tool along with a
proprietary audit tool called THD (Trojan Horse Detector).  COPS was
not developed by CyberSoft and is available free on the Internet,
however, CyberSoft believes it is necessary to provide a certificate
of traceability for COPS.  It receives the program directly from the
author, Dan Farmer, and supplies it to the end user without
modification other than packaging.  This insures that the end user
does not receive a trojaned or corrupt copy of the program.  The THD
program makes use of the fact that many Trojan attacks use duplicate
file names where the file name of the Trojan is the same as a popular
Unix command in order to execute.  The &quot;ls&quot; command is
normally stored in the &quot;/usr/bin&quot; directory.  Since many
users allow world read permission on their account control file,
(a.k.a.  dot-files) it is easy to learn the search path selected by
that user to search for system commands.  If an area that can be
written into is in the search path prior to &quot;/usr/bin&quot;, then
a Trojan or virus infected version of the ls command can be located in
that directory and will be executed.  The THD program looks for
duplicate file names throughout the system.  It also detects known
high risk file names such as &quot;/tmp/gift&quot; which is the result
of the Unix Usenix Virus (a.k.a. AT&amp;T Attack Virus) running on the
system.
<p>
Inspection is provided by a standard virus scanner.  Since the Typhoid
Mary problem affects Unix systems, the scanner simultaneously searches
for Unix, MS-DOS, Macintosh and Amiga viruses on the Unix system.  It
has a user accessible pattern matching language called CyberSoft Virus
Description Language, CVDL, which can be used to keep the scanner up
to date.  In fact, the end user can use legally obtained scan codes
from other vendors or of their own creation in order to provide
independence from the vendor.
<p>
There were multiple reasons why CyberSoft felt it was necessary to
develop a virus description language.  The increasing sophistication
of the problems was becoming difficult using standard scanning
technology.  Many of the viruses that attack UNIX are written entirely
in source code and executed in interpretative languages such as
script.  Scan codes cannot be easily designed to find a virus in which
white space, the use of tabs and variable names change.  Normal scan
codes depend on the fact that binary executables contain stable
strings of code that can be searched for at specific addresses
(excluding polymorph and stealth).  This is only partially true in the
UNIX environment.  Since VFind was designed to search for UNIX,
MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh and Commodore Amiga viruses on the UNIX
platform, addresses could no longer be specific since the infected
file might exist within a pseudo-disk or a compound file such as a tar
file.  In addition, the sequences of stable code values had to
increase in size to hold statistical validity and not generate false
hits.
<p>
Scanning for viruses written in source code required several
innovations in virus scanners.  Many of the features required are
normal parts of compiler parsers.  Compiler parsers are the first step
in the process of taking a computer program written in a source
language and producing a binary executable.  CyberSoft felt that a
compiler parser could provide a solution to its technical goals,
however, it would be necessary to define an entire language for the
parser to work correctly.  At the time this decision was being made,
1991, CyberSoft was unable to locate any standards for a virus
description language.  The language was defined in January 1992 and
named the CyberSoft Virus Description Language, CVDL.
<p>
During the design of CVDL, several goals were defined.  The first was
to design a universal way of describing pattern matching.  The second
was that the language incorporate enough features that unforeseen
future requirements could be resolved without changing the language or
code.  The grammar and versatility of the language must allow general
programming within the pattern matching framework.  These goals
dictated many of the intrinsic features within CVDL, including the
necessity to process any character or hex stream.  Originally, we
desired the capability of processing any length pattern description,
however, practical limits prevailed and a limit of 32,000 bytes per
description was defined.  A description of 32,000 bytes length can
yield an actual pattern thousands of times longer so the constraint
was considered non-binding.  Boolean operators were defined and
upper/lower case sensitivity or case insensitivity was made a user
selectable option.  One of the hardest requirements to efficiently
design was the ability to provide forward reference proximity
scanning.  This feature was a necessity to locate source code viruses.
Proximity scanning allows the definition of a pattern that will not be
affected by the ambiguity of the typist or white space.
<p>
One of the design features of CVDL is its ability to be used for the
cleanup of data spills by searching a system for predefined patterns.
While data spills are not a common problem with software attacks, they
are a common problem with hacker attacks.  A hacker will store
interesting files in obscure locations.  Many organizations caveat
&quot;interesting&quot; files using document headers such as &quot;TOP
SECRET&quot; or &quot;COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL&quot;.  Using CVDL, many
different possible patterns of actual code can be pattern matched
within defined constraints.  In this way, CVDL is able to produce a
basic model of a pattern that can match with a high percentage of
accuracy and integrity.
<p>
Finally, an MD5 cryptographic integrity tool called CIT provides
integrity to the entire file system.  CIT identifies all files which
have been modified, added or deleted to the file system.  A side
benefit to this ability is a reduction in help desk repair time when
correcting system problems.
<p>
The use of tools from all three categories of protection, along with
sensible policies and procedures, provides maximum protection against
software method attacks in Unix by providing support in each area that
is deficient in the other tools.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>9. PROJECTION OF FUTURE PROBLEMS</h2>
<p></center>
I believe that the problem of attack software written for and targeted
against Unix systems will continue to grow, especially now that the
Internet has gained popularity.  Unix systems are the backbone of the
world wide Internet.  Viruses will become more prevalent because they
provide all of the benefits of other forms of attack while having few
drawbacks.  Transplatform viruses may become common as an effective
attack.  All of the methods currently used in creating MS-DOS viruses
can be ported to Unix.  This includes the creation of automated
CAD/CAM virus tools, stealth, polymorphism and armor.  The future of
viruses on Unix is already hinted at by the wide spread use of Bots
and Kill-Bots, (slang term referring to software robots).  These
programs are able to move from system to system performing their
function.  Using a Bot as a dropper or creating a virus that includes
bot-like capability is simple.  With the advent of global networks,
the edge between viruses, bots, worms and Trojans will blur.  Attacks
will be created that use abilities from all of these forms and others
to be developed.  There have already been cases where people have used
audit tools such as COPS and SATAN to attack a system.  Combining
these tools with a virus CAD/CAM program will allow a fully functional
virus factory to create custom viruses and attacks against specific
targets such as companies that are disliked by the perpetuator.  The
information services provided by the Internet already provide
sufficient information in the form of IP addresses and email domain
addresses to identify, locate and attack systems owned by specific
entities.
<p>
<p>
Finally, viruses and worms can provide the perfect format for a
hostage shielded denial of service attack.  It is well known that an
Internet attached system can be made to &quot;disappear&quot; or crash
by flooding it with IP packets.  Site administrators can protect their
systems from crashing by programming their local router to filter out
packets from the attacking source.  The system will still disappear
because legitimate users will be squeezed out by the flood of attack
packets, but filtering at the router can at least save the system from
crashing.  Unfortunately, anyone can masquerade as someone else on the
Internet by merely using their IP address.  This attack can send a
barrage of packets to the target site, each of which has a different
source IP address.  It is not possible to use a router to filter from
this type of attack, but the Internet service provider can trace the
source of attack by physical channel without relying upon the IP
address.  In cooperation with other Internet providers, the attacker
can be isolated from the Internet for a short time.  Hopefully, the
attacker will become bored and go away or can be identified for action
by law enforcement.  Another possibility is to use viruses to generate
the attack.  If a virus is successful in spreading to thousands of
sites on the Internet and is programmed to start an IP attack against
a specific target on the same day at the same time then there is no
way to stop the attack because it has originated from thousands of
sites all of which are live hostages.  The site under attack will have
to go off line since the Internet service providers will be helpless
in the face of a coordinated dispersed attack.  Since the impact
against each individual hostage system is low, the hostages may not
even notice that there is a problem.  The Internet service provider
attached to the target system is in the best position to detect the
attack, however, they are as subject to this attack as the target
since they may &quot;crash&quot; from the excessive bandwidth usage
flooding their network from multiple sources.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>10. SCENARIO OF A VIRUS ATTACK AGAINST A SECURE UNIX NETWORK</h2>
<p></center>
The military and many other companies believe that they are protected
against focused attacks because they employ a closed network
configuration.  In some cases these networks may also use highly
secure &quot;B&quot; rated operating systems [NCSC-TG-006].
Typically, the network will not allow modems, Internet connections or
have any electronic connections to organizations outside of the
immediate need.  In addition, the networks are almost always
heterogeneous because of legacy equipment, primarily PC systems.  The
network designers normally allow the PC systems to retain their floppy
disk drives even thought their attachment to a network renders them
nonessential.  Networks of this type have been considered secure,
however, they are open to information warfare attacks via a focused
virus.  Assuming that the perpetuator is an outsider without access to
the equipment or premises, one possible method of attack against this
type of network would take advantage of both the Typhoid Mary Syndrome
and Transplatform Viruses to produce an attack that is targeted
against the Unix systems but originated from an attached PC.  A virus
can be created whose payload is triggered by executing on a PC that is
attached to the target network.  This is not hard with a little inside
information about the configuration of the network.  The perpetuator
would then install the virus at all of the local Universities in the
hope that someone working at the installation is taking a night class
or that one of their children will unknowingly infect a common usage
home computer.  At that point, the virus has a good chance of entering
the target network.  This is a well known vector and is enhanced
because the virus will not reveal itself.  Once on the target system,
the PC virus will act like a dropper releasing a Unix virus into the
backbone.  The payload virus may be necessary because many Unix
backbone systems are not PC compatible.  The Unix virus payload can
then install a backdoor which can be remotely directed.  In addition,
the virus can create a covert channel by making use of messenger
viruses.  While the use of messenger viruses are slow and have low
bandwidth, they are bi-directional and can be used for command and
control of more complex attacks.
<p>
<p><center>
<h2>11. CONCLUSION</h2>

I believe that the problem of attack software targeted against Unix
systems will continue to grow.  Viruses may become more prevalent
because they provide all of the benefits of other forms of attack,
while having few drawbacks.  Transplatform viruses may become common
as an effective attack.  All of the methods currently used in creating
MS-DOS viruses can be ported to Unix.  This includes the creation of
automated CAD/CAM virus tools, stealth, polymorphism and armor.  The
future of viruses on Unix is already hinted at by the wide spread use
of Bots and Kill-bots (slang term referring to software robots).
These programs are able to move from system to system performing their
function.  Using a Bot as a dropper or creating a virus that includes
bot-like capability is simple.  With the advent of global networks,
the edge between viruses, bots, worms and Trojans will blur.  Attacks
will be created that use abilities from all of these forms and others
to be developed.  There have already been cases where people have used
audit tools such as COPS and SATAN to attack a system.  Combining
these tools with a virus CAD/CAM program will allow a fully functional
virus factory to create custom viruses to attack specific targets.
<p>
As these problems unfold, new methods of protection must be created.
Research has hinted at several promising methods of protection,
including real time security monitors that use artificial intelligence
for simple decision making.  It is my hope that these problems never
reach existence, but I am already testing them in an attempt to devise
methods of counteracting them.  If I can create these programs, so can
others.
<p>
Even with the current problems and the promise of more sophisticated
problems and solutions in the future, the one thing that I believe to
be certain is that Unix or Unix-like systems will continue to provide
a pay back that is well worth the cost of operating them.
