</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, I see more and more viruses which in their
steps of exisstence depend on some data downloaded from the Internet. For
example, several common viruses download trojans from the internet and
install them in the system. Or, some viruses are simply unable to replicate
wihtout certain files located in special places on the Internet.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take for example the infamous Davinia virus,
which was reported ItW by Panda. This virus cannot replicate without a
copy of itself beeing available at a the specific Internet location on
the Spanish web site "terra.es".&nbsp; If this virus would have been reported
by two different WildList reporters then it would have got into the WildList.
Moreover, even if the page is no longer available, and the virus would
not work anymore, it would still stay in the WildList for at least 6 months,
when if no subsequent reports are received it will be removed automatically.
I don't think this would be correct from a user's point of view. If the
virus doesn't work anymore,
<br>then it can't be ItW, thus, it should not be included in the WildList.&nbsp;
Other case is the known virus JS/Unicle. This one downloads a couple of
trojans from a specific internet location, and runs them. However, they
are no longer available for download, as the respective page was removed,
so the respective trojans have no chance to be found anymore on user's
machines. From this point of view, the WildCore honestly provides only
the JS/Unicle sample itself, without including the trojans ownloaded by
the virus. (Hi Ian!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I believe that some AV testing institutions
include the&nbsp; respective trojans in their tests, tests which are supposedly
based on the latest WildList. I personally don't find that fair - the specific
trojans downloaded by JS/Unicle are something totally unrelated (now) to
the virus itself, and should not be used while testing antivirus programs
for detection of the latest WildList.&nbsp; Therefore I think it would
be totally unfair to punish a product for not detecting some malware which
simply cannot technically be found ItW anymore, during a test which reports
if the product is able to detect all the malware which is currently found
ItW. Don't get me wrong - I don't say that things which are not anymore
ItW should not be detected. They definitively should be detected, but a
product should not be punished for not detecting them in a test which verifies
the ability of a product to detect currently ItW malware...
