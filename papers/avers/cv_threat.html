                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




                                  Executive Summary

          Computer  viruses and related  threats represent  an increasingly
          serious security problem in computing systems and networks.  This
          document   presents   guidelines   for   preventing,   deterring,
          containing, and recovering  from attacks  of viruses and  related
          threats.    This  section acquaints  senior  management  with the
          nature of the  problem and outlines some of the steps that can be
          taken to reduce an organization's vulnerability.


          What Are Computer Viruses and Related Threats?

          Computer  viruses are  the most  widely recognized  example of  a
          class of  programs  written to  cause  some form  of  intentional
          damage  to  computer  systems  or  networks.    A  computer virus
          performs two basic functions: it copies itself to other programs,
          thereby infecting  them,   and it  executes the  instructions the                  
          author has included in it.  Depending on the author's motives,  a
          program  infected with a virus may  cause damage immediately upon
          its execution, or it may wait until a certain event has occurred,
          such as a particular date and time.   The damage can vary widely,
          and can be so extensive as to require  the complete rebuilding of
          all system software and data.  Because viruses can spread rapidly
          to  other  programs   and  systems,   the  damage  can   multiply
          geometrically.

          Related threats include other forms  of destructive programs such
          as  Trojan horses  and  network worms.    Collectively, they  are
          sometimes  referred to as malicious software.  These programs are                                    
          often written to masquerade as useful programs, so that users are
          induced into copying them and sharing  them with friends and work
          colleagues.  The malicious software  phenomena is fundamentally a
          people  problem,  as  it  is  authored  and  initially  spread by
          individuals who use systems in an unauthorized manner.  Thus, the
          threat of unauthorized use, by unauthorized and authorized users,                                                      
          must be addressed as a part of virus prevention.


          What Are the Vulnerabilities They Exploit?

          Unauthorized  users  and malicious  software  may gain  access to
          systems through  inadequate system  security mechanisms,  through
          security holes in applications or systems, and through weaknesses
          in  computer management,  such  as the  failure  to properly  use
          existing security mechanisms.   Malicious software can  be copied

                                          v












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



          intentionally onto systems,  or be spread when  users unwittingly
          copy and share  infected software  obtained from public  software
          repositories,  such as  software bulletin  boards  and shareware.
          Because malicious software often hides  its destructive nature by
          performing or  claiming to  perform some  useful function,  users
          generally don't suspect  that they are copying  and spreading the
          problem.


          Why Are Incidents of Viruses and Related Threats On the Rise?

          Viruses  and related threats, while not  a recent phenomena, have
          had  relatively little  attention focused  on  them in  the past.
          They  occurred  less  frequently  and  caused  relatively  little
          damage. For these  reasons, they were frequently  treated lightly
          in computer design and by management, even though their potential
          for harm was known to be great.

          Computer   users   have   become  increasingly   proficient   and
          sophisticated.  Software  applications are increasingly  complex,
          making  their  bugs  and  security  loopholes more  difficult  to
          initially detect and correct by the manufacturer.  In conjunction
          with these two  factors, some brands  of software are now  widely
          used, thus their bugs  and security loopholes are often  known to
          users.  With the  widespread use of personal computers  that lack
          effective  security   mechanisms,  it  is  relatively   easy  for
          knowledgeable users to  author malicious  software and then  dupe
          unsuspecting users into copying it.



          Steps Toward Reducing Risk

          Organizations can take steps to reduce  their risk to viruses and
          related threats.  Some  of the more important steps  are outlined
          below.

             o Include  the  damage potential  of  viruses, unauthorized
               use, and related threats in risk analysis and contingency
               planning.    Develop  a  plan   to  deal  with  potential
               incidents.

             o Make  computer security  education a prerequisite  to any
               computer use.   Teach users how to  protect their systems
               and detect evidence of tampering or unusual activity.

             o Ensure that technically  oriented security and management
               staff are in place to deal with security incidents.

             o Use the security  mechanisms that  exist in your  current
               software.  Ensure that  they are used correctly.   Add to
               them as necessary.

             o Purchase  and  use  software  tools  to aid  in  auditing
               computing  activity   and  detecting   the  presence   of
               tampering and damage.

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 1




                                   1. Introduction

          This document provides  guidance for  technical managers for  the
          reduction of  risk to  their computer  systems and networks  from
          attack  by  computer  viruses,  unauthorized  users,  and related
          threats.   The guidance  discusses the combined  use of policies,
          procedures, and controls to address security vulnerabilities that
          can leave systems  open to attack.   The aim of this  document is
          not to provide solutions  to the wide range of  specific problems
          or  vulnerabilities,  rather  it is  to  help  technical managers
          administer their systems and networks such that manifestations of
          viruses and related threats can be initially prevented, detected,
          and contained.


          1.1  Audience and Scope

          This document  is intended primarily  for the managers  of multi-
          user systems,  personal computers, and  associated networks,  and
          managers  of  end-user  groups.   Additionally,  the  document is
          useful  for the users of such systems.   The document presents an
          overview  of  computer  viruses  and  related threats,  how  they
          typically work, the  methods by  which they can  attack, and  the
          harm they can  potentially cause.   It then presents guidance  in
          the following areas:

               o  Multi-User  Systems  and  Associated Networks  -  with                  
                  guidance  directed at  managers  of  medium  to  small
                  systems (as opposed to mainframes that already provide
                  generally  effective security controls or are by their
                  nature more secure) and associated wide area and large
                  local area networks, as well  as managers of end-users
                  of such systems

               o  Personal Computer  Systems and Networks -  guidance is                  
                  directed at those  responsible for  the management  of
                  personal computers and personal  computer networks, as
                  well as the managers of personal computer end-users


          Within   these   general    categories,   individual    computing
          environments will  vary  widely, from  size of  computer to  user
          population to type  of software and  computing requirements.   To
          accommodate  these differences,  the guidance  presented  here is
          general  in nature.   It  attempts to  address computer  security
          problems and vulnerabilities that are likely  to be found in most

                                         1-1












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 1



          computing environments. This  document does not  address problems
          directly related to specific  brands of software or hardware.   A
          reading list at the  end of the document contains  references and
          pointers to other  literature that  address specific systems  and
          software.

          Recommended control measures are  grouped according to categories
          that include general policies and procedures, education, software
          management,  technical  controls,  monitoring,   and  contingency
          planning.  The guidance emphasizes the need for a strong security
          program as a means for protection  from manifestations of viruses
          and  related threats,  and  as a  means for  providing detection,
          containment,  and  recovery.  Such  a  security  program requires
          personal involvement on the part of management to ensure that the
          proper  policies, procedures,  and technical controls  exist, and
          that users are  educated so that  they can follow safe  computing
          practices  and  understand the  proper  actions to  take  if they
          detect  the   presence  of  viruses  or  related  threats.    The
          guidelines  recommend that  network  managers, multi-user  system
          managers, end-users, and  end-user managers work with  each other
          and approach virus protection from an organizationally consistent
          basis. 


          1.2  How to Use This Guide

          This document is divided  into five chapters and two  appendices.
          Chapter 2 describes  in general how viruses  and related software
          operate, the vulnerabilities  they exploit, and  how they can  be
          introduced  into  systems  and  networks.   Chapter  3  discusses
          general protection strategies and control  measures that apply to
          technical and  end-user management  in general;  this is done  so
          that  the same  guidance need  not be  repeated for  each  of the
          succeeding  chapters   that  deal  with   specific  environments.
          Chapters 4  and 5  present  guidance specific  to multi-user  and
          personal  computer environments,  respectively.  The  guidance in
          these chapters is  directed at the respective  technical managers
          and managers of associated  networks, as well as the  managers of
          end-user  groups  that use  such  systems  and networks.    It is
          recommended  that all  readers,  regardless  of their  management
          perspective,  examine  Chapters 3,  4,  and  5 to  gain  a fuller
          appreciation of  the whole  environment with  regard to  threats,
          vulnerabilities, and controls.

          Appendix  A   contains  document  references,  while  Appendix  B
          contains a reading  list with references to  general and specific
          information on various types of  viruses, systems, and protective

                 2.  A Brief Overview on Viruses and Related Threats

          The term  computer virus  is often  used  in a  general sense  to                    
          indicate any software that can cause harm to systems or networks.
          However,  computer viruses are just one example of many different
          but related forms of  software that can act with great  speed and
          power to  cause extensive  damage -other  important examples  are
          Trojan horses  and network  worms.   In this  document, the  term
          malicious software refers to such software.            
	  


          2.1  Trojan Horses

          A Trojan horse1 program is a  useful or apparently useful program
          or command procedure  containing hidden code that,  when invoked,
          performs some unwanted  function.   An author of  a Trojan  horse
          program might first create or gain access to the source code of a
          useful program that  is attractive to  other users, and then  add
          code  so  that  the program  performs  some  harmful function  in
          addition to  its useful function.   A simple example  of a Trojan
          horse  program  might  be  a  calculator  program  that  performs
          functions similar  to that of a  pocket calculator.  When  a user
          invokes the program, it appears to be performing calculations and
          nothing more, however it may also  be quietly deleting the user's
          files, or performing any  number of harmful actions.   An example
          of an even simpler Trojan horse program is one that performs only
          a  harmful  function, such  as a  program  that does  nothing but
          delete files.  However,  it may appear to be a  useful program by
          having a name such as CALCULATOR  or something similar to promote
          acceptability.

          Trojan  horse  programs  can  be  used  to  accomplish  functions
          indirectly  that  an  unauthorized  user  could  not   accomplish
          directly.  For example, a user of a  multi-user system who wishes
          to gain access to other users' files could create a  Trojan horse
          program to circumvent the users' file  security mechanisms.   The
          Trojan horse program, when run, changes  the invoking user's file
          permissions so  that the  files are  readable by  any user.   The
          author could then induce users to run  this program by placing it
          in a  common directory and  naming it such that  users will think
                                        

               1  named after the use of a  hollow wooden horse filled with
          enemy  soldiers used  to  gain entry  into the  city  of Troy  in
          ancient Greece.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 2



          the program is a useful utility.  After a user runs  the program,
          the author can then  access the information in the  user's files,
          which  in  this  example  could  be  important  work or  personal
          information.  Affected users may not  notice the changes for long
          periods of time unless they are very observant.

          An example of a Trojan horse program that would be very difficult
          to detect  would be a  compiler on a  multi-user system  that has
          been modified  to insert additional code into certain programs as
          they are  compiled, such as a login program.   The code creates a
          trap door in the  login program which permits the  Trojan horse's          
          author to log onto the system using a special password.  Whenever
          the  login program is recompiled, the compiler will always insert
          the trap  door code into the program,  thus the Trojan horse code
          can never  be discovered  by reading  the login  program's source
          code.  For more information on this example, see [THOMPSON84].

          Trojan horse  programs are introduced  into systems in  two ways:
          they are initially  planted, and unsuspecting users  copy and run
          them.  They are planted in software repositories that many people
          can  access,  such  as  on  personal  computer  network  servers,
          publicly-accessible directories in  a multi-user environment, and
          software bulletin boards.   Users are then essentially duped into
          copying  Trojan   horse  programs   to  their   own  systems   or
          directories.    If  a  Trojan  horse  program performs  a  useful
          function and causes  no immediate or  obvious damage, a user  may
          continue to spread it  by sharing the program with  other friends
          and co-workers.  The compiler that  copies hidden code to a login
          program  might  be an  example of  a deliberately  planted Trojan
          horse that  could be planted  by an authorized user  of a system,
          such as a user assigned to maintain compilers and software tools.


          2.2  Computer Viruses

          Computer viruses, like  Trojan horses, are programs  that contain
          hidden  code  which  performs  some  usually  unwanted  function.
          Whereas  the  hidden code  in  a  Trojan horse  program  has been
          deliberately placed by the program's author, the hidden code in a
          computer  virus program has  been added by  another program, that
          program itself being  a computer  virus or Trojan  horse.   Thus,
          computer  viruses are  programs that  copy their  hidden code  to
          other programs, thereby infecting them.  Once infected, a program                                  
          may  continue  to infect  even more  programs.   In  due  time, a
          computer could be completely  overrun as the viruses spread  in a
          geometric manner.

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 2



          An example illustrating  how a computer  virus works might be  an
          operating system program  for a  personal computer,  in which  an
          infected version  of the operating  system exists  on a  diskette
          that contains an attractive  game.  For the game  to operate, the
          diskette must be used to boot the computer, regardless of whether
          the  computer contains  a  hard disk  with its  own  copy of  the
          (uninfected)  operating  system program.    When the  computer is
          booted using the  diskette, the infected  program is loaded  into
          memory and  begins to  run.   It immediately  searches for  other
          copies of the operating system program, and finds one on the hard
          disk.  It then copies its hidden code to the program on  the hard
          disk.  This happens so quickly  that the user may not notice  the
          slight delay before his game is run.  Later, when the computer is
          booted using the  hard disk,  the newly infected  version of  the
          operating system  will be loaded  into memory.   It will in  turn
          look  for copies  to infect.   However,  it may also  perform any
          number  of  very   destructive  actions,  such  as   deleting  or
          scrambling all the files on the disk.

          A computer  virus exhibits three  characteristics: a  replication                                                                
          mechanism,  an  activation  mechanism,  and  an objective.    The                                                
          replication mechanism performs the following functions:


               o  searches for other programs to infect

               o  when  it finds a program,  possibly determines whether
                  the program has been previously infected by checking a
                  flag

               o  inserts  the  hidden  instructions  somewhere  in  the
                  program

               o  modifies  the  execution  sequence  of  the  program's
                  instructions  such  that   the  hidden  code  will  be
                  executed whenever the program is invoked

               o  possibly creates a  flag to indicate that  the program
                  has been infected

          The flag may be  necessary because without it, programs  could be
          repeatedly infected and  grow noticeably large.   The replication
          mechanism could  also perform  other functions  to help  disguise
          that the file  has been infected,  such as resetting the  program
          file's modification date to  its previous value, and storing  the
          hidden code within the program so that the program's size remains
          the same.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 2




          The activation mechanism checks for the occurrence of some event.              
          When the event occurs, the computer virus executes its objective,                                                                 
          which is  generally  some  unwanted,  harmful  action.    If  the
          activation mechanism checks  for a specific  date or time  before
          executing its objective, it is said  to contain a time bomb.   If                                                            
          it checks for  a certain action, such  as if an infected  program
          has been executed a preset number of times, it is said to contain
          a logic bomb.   There may be  any number of variations,  or there            
          may be no  activation mechanism other than  the initial execution
          of the infected program.

          As mentioned, the  objective is  usually some unwanted,  possibly
          destructive event.   Previous examples  of computer viruses  have
          varied widely in  their objectives, with some  causing irritating
          but  harmless displays to  appear, whereas others  have erased or
          modified files or  caused system hardware to  behave differently.
          Generally, the objective consists of  whatever actions the author
          has designed into the virus.

          As with Trojan horse programs, computer viruses can be introduced
          into  systems  deliberately  and  by  unsuspecting  users.    For
          example, a Trojan horse program whose  purpose is to infect other
          programs  could be  planted  on a  software  bulletin board  that
          permits  users  to upload  and download  programs.   When  a user
          downloads the program and then executes it, the program  proceeds
          to infect other programs in the  user's system.  If the  computer
          virus hides  itself well, the user  may continue to spread  it by
          copying the infected  program to other  disks, by backing it  up,
          and  by sharing  it  with other  users.   Other  examples of  how
          computer   viruses  are   introduced  include   situations  where
          authorized users  of  systems deliberately  plant viruses,  often
          with  a time bomb mechanism.  The  virus may then activate itself
          at some later point in time, perhaps when the user is  not logged
          onto  the  system  or  perhaps  after   the  user  has  left  the
          organization.    For more  information  on computer  viruses, see
          [DENNING88]


          2.3  Network Worms

          Network  worm  programs use  network  connections to  spread from
          system to  system,  thus network  worms attack  systems that  are
          linked via communications lines.  Once  active within a system, a
          network worm can behave as a  computer virus, or it could implant
          Trojan  horse programs  or perform  any number  of disruptive  or
          destructive actions.  In a sense, network worms are like computer

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 2



          viruses with the ability to infect other systems as well as other
          programs.  Some people use the term virus to include both cases.

          To replicate themselves,  network worms use some sort  of network
          vehicle, depending on the type of  network and systems.  Examples
          of network vehicles include (a) a network mail facility, in which
          a worm  can mail a  copy of itself  to other  systems, or (b),  a
          remote execution capability, in  which a worm can execute  a copy
          of itself on  another system, or  (c) a remote login  capability,
          whereby a worm  can log into a  remote system as a  user and then
          use commands to  copy itself from one  system to the other.   The
          new copy of  the network worm is  then run on the  remote system,
          where it may continue to spread to more systems in a like manner.
          Depending on the size of a network,  a network worm can spread to
          many  systems  in a  relatively short  amount  of time,  thus the
          damage it can cause to one system is multiplied by the  number of
          systems to which it can spread.

          A network  worm exhibits the  same characteristics as  a computer
          virus: a replication mechanism, possibly an activation mechanism,                                           
          and an objective.   The replication mechanism  generally performs                 
          the following functions:

               o  searches for other systems to infect by examining host
                  tables  or  similar   repositories  of  remote  system
                  addresses

               o  establishes  a   connection  with  a   remote  system,
                  possibly by  logging in  as a  user  or using  a  mail
                  facility or remote execution capability

               o  copies itself to the remote system and causes the copy
                  to be run

          The network worm may  also attempt to determine whether  a system
          has previously been infected before copying itself to the system.
          In a multi-tasking computer, it may also disguise its presence by
          naming itself as a system process  or using some other name  that
          may not be noticed by a system operator.

          The  activation mechanism might use a  time bomb or logic bomb or
          any number of variations to activate itself.  Its objective, like
          all malicious software, is whatever the author  has designed into
          it.  Some network  worms have been designed for a useful purpose,
          such as to perform general "house-cleaning" on networked systems,
          or  to  use extra  machine  cycles  on each  networked  system to
          perform  large  amounts  of  computations  not practical  on  one

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 2



          system.  A network worm with  a harmful objective could perform a
          wide range of  destructive functions, such  as deleting files  on
          each affected computer, or by implanting Trojan horse programs or
          computer viruses.

          Two examples of  actual network  worms are presented  here.   The
          first involved a Trojan horse program that  displayed a Christmas
          tree  and  a message  of  good  cheer (this  happened  during the
          Christmas  season).   When  a  user  executed  this  program,  it
          examined  network   information  files  which  listed  the  other
          personal computers that could  receive mail from this user.   The
          program then mailed itself to those  systems.  Users who received
          this message  were  invited to  run  the Christmas  tree  program
          themselves, which they did.   The network worm thus  continued to
          spread to  other systems until  the network was  nearly saturated
          with traffic.   The network  worm did not  cause any  destructive
          action other than disrupting communications and causing a loss in
          productivity [BUNZEL88].

          The second example concerns  the incident whereby a  network worm
          used the collection of  networks known as the Internet  to spread
          itself to several  thousands of computers located  throughout the
          United States.  This worm  spread itself automatically, employing
          somewhat sophisticated  techniques  for  bypassing  the  systems'
          security  mechanisms.  The  worm's replication mechanism accessed
          the systems by using one of three methods:

               o  it employed  password cracking, in  which it attempted                               
                  to log into systems using  usernames for passwords, as
                  well as using words from an on-line dictionary

               o  it exploited a  trap door  mechanism in mail  programs                                  
                  which  permitted  it  to  send  commands to  a  remote
                  system's command interpreter

               o  it exploited a  bug in  a network information  program                                  
                  which permitted it to access a remote system's command
                  interpreter

          By using a  combination of  these methods, the  network worm  was
          able to copy itself  to different brands of computers  which used
          similar versions of a widely-used  operating system.  Many system
          managers  were unable to  detect its  presence in  their systems,
          thus  it  spread  very quickly,  affecting  several  thousands of
          computers  within  two  days.    Recovery efforts  were  hampered
          because  many  sites  disconnected from  the  network  to prevent

          further  infections, thus  preventing those sites  from receiving
          network mail that explained how to correct the problems.

          It was unclear what  the network worm's objective was,  as it did
          not destroy  information, steal  passwords, or  plant viruses  or
          Trojan horses.  The  potential for destruction was very  high, as
          the  worm  could have  contained  code  to effect  many  forms of
          damage, such as  to destroy all files  on each system.   For more
          information, see [DENNING89] and [SPAFFORD88].


          2.4  Other Related Software Threats

          The number of  variations of Trojan horses, computer viruses, and
          network  worms is apparently endless.  Some have names, such as a
          rabbit, whose objective is to spread wildly within or among other          
          systems  and  disrupt  network  traffic,  or a  bacterium,  whose                                                          
          objective is to  replicate within a  system and eat up  processor
          time  until computer  throughput is  halted [DENNING88].   It  is
          likely  that  many  new forms  will  be  created, employing  more
          sophisticated techniques for spreading and causing damage.


          2.5  The Threat of Unauthorized Use

          In that computer viruses and related forms of malicious  software
          are  intriguing issues  in  themselves, it  is  important not  to
          overlook that they are created by people, and are fundamentally a
          people problem.  In  essence, examples of malicious  software are
          tools that  people use  to extend  and enhance  their ability  to
          create mischief and various other forms of damage.  Such software
          can do  things that  the interactive  user often cannot  directly
          effect,  such  as  working  with   great  speed,  or  maintaining
          anonymity,  or  doing  things  that  require  programmatic system
          calls.   But in  general,  malicious software  exploits the  same
          vulnerabilities  as  can knowledgeable  users.   Thus,  any steps
          taken to  reduce the likelihood  of attack by  malicious software
          should address  the likelihood  of unauthorized  use by  computer
          users.

                            3. Virus Prevention in General


          To provide general  protection from attacks by  computer viruses,
          unauthorized users, and related threats,  users and managers need
          to eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities.  A general summary of the
          vulnerabilities that  computer viruses  and  related threats  are
          most likely to exploit is as follows:

             o lack of user  awareness - users  copy and share  infected
               software, fail to detect signs of virus activity,  do not
               understand proper security techniques

             o absence of  or inadequate  security  controls -  personal
               computers generally  lack software and  hardware security
               mechanisms that help to  prevent and detect  unauthorized
               use,  existing   controls  on   multi-user  systems   can
               sometimes be surmounted by knowledgeable users

             o ineffective  use of  existing security  controls -  using
               easily guessed passwords, failing to use access controls,
               granting users more access to resources than necessary

             o bugs   and  loopholes  in   system  software  -  enabling
               knowledgeable users to break into systems or exceed their
               authorized privileges

             o unauthorized use  - unauthorized  users can  break in  to
               systems, authorized users can exceed  levels of privilege
               and misuse systems

             o susceptibility  of  networks  to misuse  -  networks  can
               provide anonymous access to systems,  many are in general
               only as secure as the systems which use them

          As can be seen from this  summary, virus prevention requires that
          many  diverse  vulnerabilities   be  addressed.    Some   of  the
          vulnerabilities  can  be  improved  upon  significantly, such  as
          security controls that can be added or improved, while others are
          somewhat inherent in computing, such as  the risk that users will
          not use  security controls  or follow  policies, or  the risk  of
          unauthorized use  of computers and networks.  Thus, it may not be
          possible  to  completely  protect  systems  from  all  virus-like
          attacks.   However, to attain  a realistic degree  of protection,
          all areas of vulnerability must be addressed; improving upon some

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 3



          areas at the expense of others will still leave significant holes
          in security.  

          To  adequately  address all  areas  of vulnerability,  the active
          involvement of  individual users,  the management  structure, and
          the  organization  in a  virus  prevention program  is essential.                                   
          Such a program, whether formal or informal, depends on the mutual
          cooperation of the  three groups to identify  vulnerabilities, to
          take steps to correct them, and to monitor the results.

          A virus prevention program must be initially based upon effective
          system   computer  administration   that   restricts  access   to
          authorized  users,   ensures  that  hardware   and  software  are
          regularly monitored and maintained,  makes backups regularly, and
          maintains contingency procedures  for potential problems.   Sites
          that do not maintain a basic computer administration program need
          to put one into  place, regardless of their size or  the types of
          computers used.  Many system vendors supply system administration
          manuals that describe the aspects of a basic program, and one can
          consult documents such as [FIPS73], or [NBS120].

          Once a basic  administration program is in place,  management and
          users need  to incorporate  virus prevention  measures that  will
          help to deter attacks by viruses and related threats, detect when                                                           
          they occur, contain the attacks to limit damage, and recover in a                                                        
          reasonable amount of  time without loss  of data.  To  accomplish
          these aims, attention needs to be focused on the following areas:

             o educating  users about malicious software in general, the               
               risks  that  it  poses,  how  to  use  control  measures,
               policies, and  procedures to  protect themselves and  the
               organization

             o software management policies  and procedures that address               
               public-domain software,  and the  use and  maintenance of
               software in general

             o use of technical controls that help  to prevent and deter               
               attacks by malicious software and unauthorized users

             o monitoring of user and software  activity to detect signs               
               of attacks, to  detect policy violations, and  to monitor
               the  overall effectiveness  of policies,  procedures, and
               controls

             o contingency  policies and  procedures for  containing and               
               recovering from attacks

                                                                  CHAPTER 3




          General  guidance  in each  of these  areas  is explained  in the
          following sections.


          3.1  User Education

          Education is  one of  the primary  methods by  which systems  and
          organizations can achieve  greater protection  from incidents  of
          malicious software  and unauthorized  use.   In situations  where
          technical controls do not provide complete protection (i.e., most
          computers),  it  is ultimately  people  and their  willingness to
          adhere to security  policies that will determine  whether systems
          and organizations are  protected.  By  educating users about  the
          general  nature  of  computer  viruses  and related  threats,  an
          organization can improve  its ability  to deter, detect,  contain
          and recover from potential incidents.

          Users should be educated about the following:

             o how malicious software  operates, methods by which  it is
               planted  and  spread,  the vulnerabilities  exploited  by
               malicious software and unauthorized users

             o general security policies  and procedures and how  to use
               them

             o the policies to follow regarding the backup, storage, and
               use of  software, especially  public-domain software  and
               shareware

             o how  to use  the technical  controls they  have  at their
               disposal to protect themselves

             o how to monitor their systems and software to detect signs
               of abnormal activity, what  to do or whom to  contact for
               more information

             o contingency procedures for containing and recovering from
               potential incidents

          User  education, while  perhaps expensive  in terms  of time  and
          resources  required, is  ultimately a cost-effective  measure for
          protecting   against   incidents   of   malicious  software   and
          unauthorized  use.  Users  who  are  better acquainted  with  the
          destructive potential of  malicious software  and the methods  by
          which it  can attack  systems  may in  turn be  prompted to  take

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 3



          measures to protect themselves.  The purpose of security policies
          and procedures will be more clear, thus users may be more willing
          to actively use them.  By educating users how to  detect abnormal
          system  activity and the resultant steps to follow for containing
          and recovering from potential  incidents, organizations will save
          money and time if and when actual incidents occur.


          3.2  Software Management

          As shown by  examples in Chapter 2,  one of the prime  methods by
          which  malicious software is initially copied  onto systems is by
          unsuspecting users.   When users  download programs from  sources
          such  as  software  bulletin  boards,  or public  directories  on
          systems or network servers, or in  general use and share software
          that has not  been obtained from a reputable source, users are in
          danger of spreading  malicious software.   To prevent users  from
          potentially spreading malicious software, managers need to

             o ensure  that users  understand  the nature  of  malicious
               software,  how it is generally spread, and  the technical
               controls to use to protect themselves

             o develop policies for  the downloading and use  of public-
               domain and shareware software

             o create some mechanism for validating such software  prior
               to allowing users to copy and use it

             o minimize the exchange  of executable  software within  an
               organization as much as possible

             o do not create software repositories  on LAN servers or in
               multi-user system directories  unless technical  controls
               exist  to   prevent  users   from  freely   uploading  or
               downloading the software

          The  role  of  education  is  important,  as  users  who  do  not
          understand  the risks  yet  who are  asked to  follow necessarily
          restrictive policies may  share and copy software anyway.   Where
          technical controls  cannot prevent  placing new  software onto  a
          system, users are  then primarily responsible for  the success or
          failure of whatever policies are developed.

          A  policy that  prohibits  any copying  or  use of  public-domain
          software  may  be  overly  restrictive,  as  some  public  domain
          programs have proved  to be  useful.  A  less restrictive  policy

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 3



          would  allow some  copying, however  a user  might first  require
          permission from the appropriate manager.  A special system should
          be used  from which  to perform  the copy  and then  to test  the
          software.  This type of system, called an isolated system, should                                                    
          be configured so that there is no risk of spreading a potentially
          malicious program to other areas of  an organization.  The system
          should  not  be  used  by  other  users, should  not  connect  to
          networks, and should not contain any  valuable data.  An isolated
          system should  also be used to test internally developed software
          and updates to vendor software.

          Other policies for managing vendor  software should be developed.
          These  policies  should   control  how  and  where   software  is
          purchased, and should  govern where the software is installed and
          how it is  to be used.  The following policies and procedures are
          suggested:

             o purchase vendor software only from reputable sources

             o maintain the software properly and update it as necessary

             o don't use pirated software, as it may have been modified

             o keep  records of  where  software  is  installed  readily
               available for contingency purposes

             o ensure that vendors can be  contacted quickly if problems
               occur

             o store the original  disks or tapes  from the vendor in  a
               secure location


          3.3  Technical Controls

          Technical  controls  are  the  mechanisms  used  to  protect  the
          security and integrity of  systems and associated data.   The use
          of technical controls can help to  prevent occurrences of viruses
          and related threats by deterring them or making it more difficult
          for  them  to gain  access  to  systems and  data.    Examples of
          technical controls include user authentication mechanisms such as
          passwords, mechanisms which provide selective levels of access to
          files and directories  (read-only, no  access, access to  certain
          users,  etc.),  and  write-protection  mechanisms  on  tapes  and
          diskettes.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 3



          The different types of technical controls and the degree to which
          they can provide protection and deterrence  varies from system to
          system, thus the use  of specific types of controls  is discussed
          in Chapters 4 and  5.  However, the following  general points are
          important to note:

             o technical  controls  should  be   used  as  available  to
               restrict system access to authorized users only

             o in the multi-user  environment, technical controls should
               be  used  to  limit  users'  privileges  to  the  minimum
               practical level; they should  work automatically and need
               not be initiated by users

             o users and system managers must be  educated as to how and
               when to use technical controls

             o where technical controls are weak or  non-existent (i.e.,
               personal  computers), they  should  be supplemented  with
               alternative   physical   controls   or   add-on   control
               mechanisms

          Managers need to determine which technical controls are available
          on  their systems, and  then the degree  to which  they should be
          used and whether additional add-on  controls are necessary.   One
          way  to  answer  these  questions  is  to  first  categorize  the
          different classes of data being processed by a system or systems,
          and then to  rank the  categories according to  criteria such  as
          sensitivity to the  organization and vulnerability of  the system
          to attack.  The rankings should then help determine the degree to
          which  the  controls  should be  applied  and  whether additional
          controls are  necessary.   Ideally, those  systems with the  most
          effective controls should  be used to process  the most sensitive
          data, and vice-versa.   As an example, a personal  computer which
          processes sensitive  employee information  should require  add-on
          user  authentication mechanisms, whereas a personal computer used
          for general word processing may not need additional controls.

          It is important to note that  technical controls do not generally
          provide complete protection against  viruses and related threats.
          They may be cracked by determined  users who are knowledgeable of
          hidden bugs  and weaknesses, and  they may be  surmounted through
          the use of Trojan horse programs, as shown by examples in Chapter
          2.  An  inherent weakness  in technical controls  is that,  while
          deterring users and  software from objects  to which they do  not
          have  access,  they may  be  totally ineffective  against attacks
          which target objects that are accessible.  For example, technical

                                         3-6












                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 3



          controls may not prevent an authorized user from destroying files
          to which the user has authorized  access.  Most importantly, when
          technical controls  are not used  properly, they  may increase  a
          system's  degree of vulnerability.   It is  generally agreed that
          fully effective technical  controls will not be  widely available
          for some time.   Because of the immediate nature  of the computer
          virus threat,  technical controls  must be  supplemented by  less
          technically-oriented control measures  such as described  in this
          chapter.


          3.4  General Monitoring

          An important aspect  of computer viruses  and related threats  is
          that they  potentially can cause  extensive damage within  a very
          small amount of time, such as minutes or seconds.  Through proper
          monitoring of  software, system activity, and in  some cases user
          activity,  managers  can increase  their  chances that  they will
          detect  early  signs  of   malicious  software  and  unauthorized
          activity.  Once the presence is  noted or suspected, managers can
          then  use  contingency  procedures to  contain  the  activity and
          recover  from whatever  damage has  been  caused.   An additional
          benefit of  general monitoring is that  over time, it can  aid in
          determining  the  necessary  level  or   degree  of  security  by
          indicating  whether security  policies, procedures,  and controls
          are working as planned.

          Monitoring  is  a  combination  of  continual system  and  system
          management  activity.   Its effectiveness depends  on cooperation
          between management and users.  The following items  are necessary
          for effective monitoring:

             o user  education  -  users must  know,  specific  to their
               computing  environment,  what   constitutes  normal   and
               abnormal system activity and whom  to contact for further
               information - this  is especially important for  users of
               personal  computers,  which   generally  lack   automated
               methods for monitoring

             o automated system  monitoring tools - generally  on multi-
               user systems, to  automate logging or accounting  of user
               and  software  accesses  to accounts,  files,  and  other
               system  objects - can  sometimes be tuned  to record only
               certain types of accesses such as "illegal" accesses




                                         3-7












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 3



             o anti-viral  software -  generally on  personal computers,
               these tools alert users of certain types of system access
               that are indicative of "typical" malicious software

             o system-sweep programs -  programs to automatically  check
               files for changes in size, date, or content

             o network  monitoring  tools -  as  with system  monitoring
               tools, to record network accesses or attempts to access

          The statistics gained  from monitoring activities should  be used
          as input for periodic reviews of  security programs.  The reviews
          should evaluate  the effectiveness of  general system management,
          and associated security policies, procedures,  and controls.  The
          statistics will indicate  the need for  changes and will help  to
          fine tune the program so that security is distributed to where it
          is most necessary.   The reviews  should also incorporate  users'
          suggestions,  and to  ensure  that  the  program  is  not  overly
          restrictive, their criticisms.


          3.5  Contingency Planning

          The  purpose  of  contingency planning  with  regard  to computer
          viruses and related threats is to be able to contain  and recover
          completely from  actual attacks.  In many  ways, effective system
          management  that  includes  user  education,  use  of   technical
          controls, software  management, and  monitoring activities,  is a
          form of  contingency  planning,  generally  because  a  well-run,
          organized  system or  facility  is better  able to  withstand the
          disruption that could  result from a  computer virus attack.   In
          addition to effective system management activities, managers need
          to consider  other contingency procedures that  specifically take
          into account the nature of computer viruses and related threats.

          Possibly  the   most  important  contingency   planning  activity
          involves the use of backups.  The ability to recover from a virus
          attack depends upon maintaining regular,  frequent backups of all
          system data.   Each backup should  be checked to ensure  that the
          backup media has not  been corrupted.  Backup media  could easily
          be corrupted because of defects, because the backup procedure was
          incorrect, or perhaps because the backup software itself has been
          attacked and modified to corrupt backups as they are made.

          Contingency procedures for  restoring from backups after  a virus
          attack  are equally  important.   Backups may  contain copies  of

                                                                  CHAPTER 3



          Restoring  the  malicious software  to  a  system that  has  been
          attacked could cause a recurrence of the problem.   To avoid this
          possibility, software should  be restored only from  its original
          media:   the tapes or diskettes from the  vendor.  In some cases,
          this may  involve reconfiguring the software,  therefore managers
          must maintain copies of configuration  information for system and
          application software.   Because data is not  directly executable,
          it can be restored from routine backups.  However,  data that has
          been  damaged  may need  to be  restored  manually or  from older
          backups.    Command files  such  as  batch procedures  and  files
          executed  when  systems  boot  or  when  user log  on  should  be
          inspected to ensure that they have  not been damaged or modified.
          Thus,  managers  will  need  to  retain  successive  versions  of
          backups, and search  through them when restoring damaged data and
          command files.

          Other contingency procedures for containing virus attacks need to
          be developed.  The following are suggested; they are discussed in
          more detail in Chapters 4 and 5:

             o ensure that accurate  records are  kept of each  system's
               configuration,  including  the  system's   location,  the
               software  it  runs,   the  system's  network  and   modem
               connections,  and  the name  of  the system's  manager or
               responsible individual

             o create  a  group  of skilled  users  to  deal  with virus
               incidents and ensure that users  can quickly contact this
               group if they suspect signs of viral activity

             o maintain a security  distribution list at each  site with
               appropriate telephone numbers of managers to contact when
               problems occur

             o isolate critical systems from  networks and other sources
               of infection

             o place  outside network  connections on  systems  with the
               best protections,  use  central  gateways  to  facilitate
               rapid disconnects


                     4. Virus Prevention for Multi-User Computers
                               and Associated Networks

          Virus prevention in the multi-user  computer environment is aided
          by the centralized system  and user management, and  the relative

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 4



          richness of technical controls.   Unlike personal computers, many
          multi-user   systems    possess   basic    controls   for    user
          authentication, for levels  of access  to files and  directories,
          and  for  protected regions  of  memory.    By themselves,  these
          controls  are not adequate, but  combined with other policies and
          procedures that specifically target viruses and related  threats,
          multi-user systems  can greatly  reduce their  vulnerabilities to
          exploitation and attack.

          However, some relatively powerful multi-user  machines are now so
          compact as  to be able to be  located in an office or  on a desk-
          top.  These machines are still fully able to support a small user
          population,  to connect to major networks, and to perform complex
          real-time operations.  But  due to their size and  increased ease
          of operation, they  are more  vulnerable to unauthorized  access.
          Also,  multi-user  machines are  sometimes  managed  by untrained
          personnel  who  do not  have adequate  time  to devote  to proper
          system management  and who may not possess a technical background
          or  understanding  of  the  system's  operation.    Thus,  it  is
          especially important for organizations who use or are considering
          machines of this nature to pay  particular attention to the risks
          of attack by unauthorized users, viruses, and related software.

          The  following sections  offer guidance  and  recommendations for
          improving the  management  and reducing  the risk  of attack  for
          multi-user computers and associated networks.


          4.1  General Policies

          Two general policies are  suggested here.  They are  intended for
          uniform adoption throughout an organization,  i.e., they will not
          be entirely effective if they are  not uniformly followed.  These
          policies are as follows:

             o An organization must assign a dedicated system manager to
               operate each multi-user computer.   The manager should be
               trained,  if  necessary,  to  operate  the  system  in  a
               practical and secure  manner.  This individual  should be
               assigned  the  management  duties  as  part  of  his  job
               description; the management duties should not be assigned
               "on top"  of the  individual's other  duties, but  rather
               adequate time should be taken from other  duties.  System
               management is  a demanding  and time-consuming  operation
               that can  unexpectedly require  complete dedication.   As
               systems are increasingly  inter-connected via networks, a
               poorly managed system that  can be used as a  pathway for

                                         4-2












                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 4



               unauthorized access  to  other  systems  will  present  a
               significant vulnerability to an organization.   Thus, the
               job of system  manager should be assigned  carefully, and
               adequate time be given  so that the job can  be performed
               completely.

             o Management needs to impress upon users the need for their
               involvement  and  cooperation in  computer  security.   A
               method  for  doing this  is  to create  an organizational
               security policy.  This policy should be a superset of all
               other  computer-related  policy,  and   should  serve  to
               clearly define what is  expected of the user.   It should
               detail  how  systems are  to be  used  and what  sorts of
               computing are permitted and not  permitted.  Users should
               read this policy  and agree  to it as  a prerequisite  to
               computer  use.   It  would also  be  helpful to  use this
               policy to create  other policies specific to  each multi-
               user system.


          4.2  Software Management

          Effective  software management  can help  to make  a  system less
          vulnerable to attack  and can make containment  and recovery more
          successful.  Carefully controlled access to software will prevent
          or  discourage  unauthorized  access.   If  accurate  records and
          backups  are maintained,  software  restoral can  be accomplished
          with a minimum  of lost time and  data.  A policy  of testing all
          new  software,  especially  public-domain   software,  will  help
          prevent  accidental infection of a system  by viruses and related
          software.    Thus,  the  following  policies and  procedures  are
          recommended:

             o Use only licensed copies of  vendor software, or software
               that can be verified to be free of  harmful code or other
               destructive aspects.  Maintain complete information about
               the software, such  as the  vendor address and  telephone
               number,  the  license  number  and  version,  and  update
               information.   Store the  software in  a secure,  tamper-
               proof location.

             o Maintain configuration reports of all installed software,
               including the operating system.  This information will be
               necessary if the software must be re-installed later.

             o Prevent user access to system  software and data.  Ensure
               that  such   software  is   fully  protected,   and  that

                                         4-3












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 4



               appropriate  monitoring  is done  to  detect attempts  at
               unauthorized access.

             o Prohibit  users from installing  software.   Users should
               first contact the system  manager regarding new software.
               The software should then be  tested on an isolated system                                                         
               to determine whether the software may contain destructive
               elements.  The isolated system should  be set up so that,
               to a practical  degree, it replicates the  target system,
               but does  not connect  to networks  or process  sensitive
               data.  A highly-skilled user knowledgeable  about viruses
               and related threats should perform the testing and ensure
               that  the  software  does  not  change  or  delete  other
               software or data.  Do not allow users to directly add any
               software  to  the system,  whether  from public  software
               repositories, or other systems, or their home systems.

             o Teach  users  to  protect  their  data from  unauthorized
               access.  Ensure that they know how to use access controls
               or  file protection  mechanisms  to prevent  others  from
               reading  or  modifying  their files.    As  possible, set
               default  file protections such that when a user creates a
               file, the file can be accessed  only by that user, and no
               others.  Each user should not permit others to use his or
               her account.

             o Do   not  set-up   directories   to  serve   as  software
               repositories  unless  technical   controls  are  used  to
               prevent users from writing  to the directory.   Make sure
               that users contact the system  manager regarding software
               they wish to place in a software repository.  It would be
               helpful  to  track  where the  software  is  installed by
               setting up a  process whereby  users must first  register
               their  names  before  they  can  copy software  from  the
               directory.

             o If  developing  software, control  the update  process so
               that the  software is not modified without authorization.
               Use a  software  management and  control  application  to
               control  access  to  the  software  and to  automate  the
               logging of modifications.

             o Accept system and  application bug fixes or  patches only
               from  highly  reliable  sources,  such  as  the  software
               vendor.  Do  not accept  patches from anonymous  sources,
               such as received via a network.  Test the new software on

               an isolated system  to ensure that the  software does not
               make an existing problem worse.


          4.3  Technical Controls

          Many  multi-user  computers   contain  basic  built-in  technical
          controls.   These  include  user  authentication  via  passwords,
          levels of user  privilege, and  file access controls.   By  using
          these  basic  controls  effectively, managers  can  significantly
          reduce the risk of attack by  preventing or deterring viruses and
          related threats from accessing a system.

          Perhaps   the   most   important  technical   control   is   user
          authentication, with the most widely  form of user authentication
          being a username associated with a  password.  Every user account
          should use a password that is  deliberately chosen so that simple
          attempts  at  password  cracking  cannot  occur.    An  effective
          password should not consist of a  person's name or a recognizable
          word, but rather should consist of alphanumeric characters and/or
          strings of words  that cannot easily  be guessed.  The  passwords
          should be changed  at regular intervals,  such as every three  to
          six months.  Some systems include or can be modified to include a
          password history, to  prevent users  from reusing old  passwords.
          For  more  information  on  effective  password   practices,  see
          [FIPS73].

          The  username/password mechanism  can  sometimes  be modified  to
          reduce opportunities for  password cracking.   One  method is  to
          increase  the running time of the  password encryption to several
          seconds.  Another method  is to cause  the user login program  to
          accept from three  to five incorrect  password attempts in a  row
          before  disabling the  user account  for several  minutes.   Both
          methods  significantly  increase the  amount  of time  a password
          cracker would  spend when making repeated attempts  at guessing a
          password.  A method for ensuring  that passwords are difficult to
          crack involves  the use  of a  program that  could systematically
          guess passwords, and  then send  warning messages  to the  system
          manager and corresponding users if successful.  The program could
          attempt passwords that  are permutations of each user's  name, as
          well as using words from an on-line dictionary.

          Besides  user  authentication,   access  control  mechanisms  are
          perhaps  the  next  most  important  technical control.    Access
          control mechanisms permit a system  manager to selectively permit
          or bar user access  to system resources regardless of  the user's
          level of privilege.  For example, a user at a low-level of system

                                         4-5












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 4



          privilege can be  granted access to a resource at  a higher level
          of privilege without raising the user's privilege through the use
          of  an access control that specifically  grants that user access.
          Usually, the  access control  can determine the  type of  access,
          e.g.,  read  or  write.   Some  access  controls  can send  alarm
          messages to  audit logs or  the system manager  when unsuccessful
          attempts are  made  to access  resources protected  by an  access
          control.

          Systems which do not use  access controls usually contain another
          more  basic  form that  grants access  based on  user categories.
          Usually, there are four: owner, where only the user who "owns" or                                   
          creates the resource  can access it;  group, where anyone in  the                                                
          same group as the owner can access the resource; world, where all                                                           
          users can access  the resource, and system,  which supersedes all                                              
          other user privileges.  Usually, a  file or directory can be  set
          up to allow any combination of the four.  Unlike access controls,
          this scheme doesn't permit access to resources on a specific user
          basis, thus if a user at a low level of privilege requires access
          to  a  system level  resource, the  user  must be  granted system
          privilege.    However,   if  used  carefully,  this   scheme  can
          adequately protect  users'  files  from  being  accessed  without
          authorization.  The  most effective  mode is to  create a  unique
          group  for each user.   Some  systems may  permit a  default file
          permission mask to  be set so  that every file  created would  be
          accessible only by the file's owner.

          Other technical control guidelines are as follows:

             o Do  not  use  the  same   password  on  several  systems.
               Additionally,  sets   of  computers  that   are  mutually
               trusting in the sense that login to one constitutes login
               to all should be carefully controlled.

             o Disable  or  remove  old or  unnecessary  user  accounts.
               Whenever users leave an  organization or no longer use  a
               system, change all passwords that the users had knowledge
               of.

             o Practice a  "least privilege"  policy, whereby  users are
               restricted to accessing resources on a need-to-know basis
               only.    User  privileges  should  be as  restricting  as
               possible without  adversely affecting the  performance of
               their  work.    To  determine  what  level  of  access is
               required, err first  by setting privileges to  their most
               restrictive,  and  upgrade  them as  necessary.    If the
               system uses access controls, attempt to maintain a user's

                                         4-6

                                                                  CHAPTER 4



               system privileges at  a low level while  using the access
               controls  to  specifically grant  access to  the required
               resources.

             o Users are generally able to determine other users' access
               to their files  and directories,  thus instruct users  to
               carefully maintain their files  and directories such that
               they are  not accessible, or at a  minimum, not writable,
               by  other  users.     As   possible,  set  default   file
               protections such  that files  and directories created  by
               each user are accessible by only that user.

             o When  using modems,  do not  provide  more access  to the
               system than is  necessary.  For example, if only dial-out
               service is required,  set up the modem  or telephone line
               so that  dial-in  service is  not possible.   If  dial-in
               service  is  necessary,  use   modems  that  require   an
               additional  passwords  or  modems  that  use a  call-back
               mechanism.  These modems may work such that a caller must
               first  identify   himself  to   the  system.     If   the
               identification has been pre-recorded  with the system and
               therefore valid,  the system  then calls back  at a  pre-
               recorded telephone number.

             o If  file encryption mechanisms  are available,  make them
               accessible to users.  Users may wish to use encryption as
               a  further means  of  protecting the  confidentiality  of
               their files, especially  if the system is  accessible via
               networks or modems.

             o Include  software so  that users  can  temporarily "lock"
               their terminals from accepting keystrokes while  they are
               away.  Use software that  automatically disables a user's
               account if no  activity occurs after a  certain interval,
               such as 10 - 15 minutes.


          4.4  Monitoring

          Many  multi-user systems  provide a  mechanism for  automatically
          recording  some  aspects of  user  and  system  activity.    This
          monitoring  mechanism,  if  used regularly,  can  help  to detect
          evidence of viruses and  related threats.  Early detection  is of
          great  value,  because malicious  software potentially  can cause
          significant damage within a matter of  minutes.  Once evidence of
          an  attack  has  been  verified,  managers  can  use  contingency
          procedures to contain and recover from any resultant damage.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 4




          Effective  monitoring   also  requires   user  involvement,   and
          therefore,  user education.  Users must  have some guidelines for
          what  constitutes normal and abnormal system activity.  They need
          to be aware of  such items as whether files have  been changed in
          content, date, or  by access permissions, whether  disk space has
          become suddenly full, and whether  abnormal error messages occur.
          They need to know whom to contact  to report signs of trouble and
          then the steps to take to contain any damage.

          The  following policies and  procedures for  effective monitoring
          are recommended:

             o Use  the  system   monitoring/auditing  tools  that   are
               available.    Follow the  procedures  recommended by  the
               system vendor, or start out by enabling the full level or
               most  detailed  level  of  monitoring.     Use  tools  as
               available to help read the logs, and determine what level
               of monitoring is adequate,  and cut back on the  level of
               detail  as  necessary.   Be  on the  guard  for excessive
               attempts to access  accounts or other resources  that are
               protected.  Examine the log regularly, at least weekly if
               not more often.

             o As  a  further aid  to  monitoring, use  alarm mechanisms
               found in  some access controls.  These  mechanisms send a
               message to the audit  log whenever an attempt is  made to
               access a resource protected by an access control.

             o If  no system monitoring is available,  or if the present
               mechanism is  unwieldy or not sufficient, investigate and
               purchase  other  monitoring  tools  as  available.   Some
               third-party software companies sell monitoring tools  for
               major operating systems  with capabilities that supersede
               those of the vendor's.

             o Educate  users  so   that  they  understand  the   normal
               operating aspects of the  system.  Ensure that  they have
               quick access  to an individual  or group  who can  answer
               their   questions   and   investigate   potential   virus
               incidents.

             o Purchase or build system sweep programs to checksum files
               at night, and report differences from previous runs.  Use
               a password checker to monitor whether passwords are being
               used effectively.

                                                                  CHAPTER 4



             o Always  report, log,  and investigate  security problems,
               even when the problems appear insignificant.  Use the log
               as input into regular security reviews.  Use  the reviews
               as a means  for evaluating the effectiveness  of security
               policies and procedures.

             o Enforce  some   form  of  sanctions  against   users  who
               consistently  violate  or  attempt  to  violate  security               
               policies and procedures.  Use the audit logs as evidence,
               and bar the users from system use.



          4.5  Contingency Planning

          As  stressed  in  Chapter  3,  backups  are  the  most  important
          contingency planning activity.   A system  manager must plan  for
          the eventuality of having  to restore all software and  data from
          backup  tapes  for any  number  of  reasons, such  as  disk drive
          failure or upgrades.  It has been shown that viruses and  related
          threats  could potentially  and unexpectedly  destroy all  system
          information  or  render  it  useless,  thus managers  should  pay
          particular  attention  to  the  effectiveness   of  their  backup
          policies.   Backup  policies  will vary  from  system to  system,
          however they should be performed daily, with a minimum of several
          months backup history.   Backup  tapes should be  verified to  be
          accurate, and should be stored off-site in a secured location.                                         

          Viruses and related  software threats  could go  undetected in  a
          system for  months to years,  and thus could  be backed  up along
          with  normal  system data.    If  such a  program  would suddenly
          trigger  and cause damage, it  may require much searching through
          old backups to determine  when the program first appeared  or was
          infected.   Therefore the  safest policy is  to restore programs,
          i.e., executable and  command files,  from their original  vendor
          media only.   Only system data  that is non-executable should  be
          restored from regular backups.  Of course, in the case of command
          files or batch procedures  that are developed or modified  in the
          course of daily system  activity, these may need to  be inspected
          manually to ensure that they have not been modified or damaged.

          Other recommended contingency planning activities are as follows:

             o Create a security distribution list  for hand-out to each
               user.   The list should include the system manager's name
               and number, and other similar information for individuals
               who  can  answer  users' questions  about  suspicious  or

                                         4-9












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 4



               unusual system activity.   The list should  indicate when
               to contact these individuals, and where  to reach them in
               emergencies.

             o Coordinate  with  other  system  managers, especially  if
               their  computers  are  connected  to  the  same  network.
               Ensure that all can be contacted  quickly in the event of
               a network emergency  by using  some mechanism other  than
               the network.

             o Besides observing  physical  security for  the system  as
               well as its  software and backup media,  locate terminals
               in offices that can be locked or in other secure areas.

             o If users are accessing the  system via personal computers
               and terminal emulation  software, keep a record  of where
               the personal computers  are located and their  network or
               port address for monitoring purposes.   Control carefully
               whether such users are uploading software to the system.

             o Exercise caution when  accepting system patches.   Do not
               accept patches that arrive over a network unless there is
               a high degree  of certainty as to their validity.   It is
               best to accept patches only from the appropriate software
               vendor.


          4.6  Associated Network Concerns

          Multi-user computers are  more often  associated with  relatively
          large  networks  than  very  localized  local  area  networks  or
          personal  computer  networks  that  may  use   dedicated  network
          servers.  The viewpoint  taken here is that wide area network and
          large local  area network  security is  essentially a  collective
          function of the systems connected to the network, i.e., it is not
          practical for a controlling system to monitor all network traffic                                                        
          and differentiate  between authorized  and unauthorized  use.   A
          system manager should generally  assume that network  connections
          pose inherent risks of  unauthorized access to the system  in the
          forms  of unauthorized  users and  malicious  software.   Thus, a
          system manager  needs to  protect the  system from  network-borne
          threats and likewise exercise responsibility by ensuring that his
          system is not  a source of such  threats, while at the  same time
          making network connections available to users as necessary.   The
          accomplishment of  these aims will  require the use  of technical
          controls  to  restrict  certain types  of  access,  monitoring to


                                         4-10












                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 4



          detect violations, and a certain amount  of trust that users will
          use the controls and follow the policies.

          Some guidelines for using networks in a more secure manner are as
          follows:

             o Assume  that  network  connections elevate  the  risk  of
               unauthorized access.  Place network connections on system
               which  provide  adequate controls,  such  as  strong user
               authentication  and  access  control mechanisms.    Avoid
               placing  network  connections  on  system  which  process
               sensitive data.

             o If the system permits, require  an additional password or
               form of authentication for accounts accessed from network
               ports.   If  possible, do  not  permit access  to  system
               manager accounts from network ports.

             o If   anonymous  or   guest  accounts   are  used,   place
               restrictions  on  the  types  of  commands  that  can  be
               executed  from  the  account.    Don't permit  access  to
               software  tools, commands  that can  increase privileges,
               and so forth.

             o As possible,  monitor  usage of  the network.   Check  if
               network connections are made at odd hours, such as during
               the night, or  if repeated attempts are made to log in to
               the system from a network port.

             o When  more than  one  computer is  connected to  the same
               network,  arrange  the  connections so  that  one machine
               serves as a central gateway for the other machines.  This
               will allow a rapid disconnect from the network in case of
               an attack.

             o Ensure that users  are fully  educated in network  usage.
               Make  them  aware  of the  additional  risks  involved in
               network access.  Instruct them to be on the alert for any
               signs of tampering, and to  contact an appropriate person
               if  they detect any suspicious activity.  Create a policy
               for responsible network  usage that details what  sort of
               computing activity will and will  not be tolerated.  Have
               users read the policy as a prerequisite to network use.

             o Warn users  to be  suspicious of  any  messages that  are
               received from unidentified or unknown sources.

          CHAPTER 4



             o Don't advertise  a system  to network  users by  printing
               more information than necessary on a welcome banner.  For
               example, don't include  messages such as "Welcome  to the
               Payroll Accounting System"  that may cause the  system to
               be more attractive to unauthorized users.

             o Don't network  to outside organizations without  a mutual
               review of security practices

                                                                  CHAPTER 5




                     5. Virus Prevention for Personal Computers 
                               and Associated Networks

          Virus  prevention in  the personal  computer environment  differs
          from that  of the multi-user  computer environment mainly  in the
          following two respects:  the relative lack of technical controls,
          and  the  resultant  emphasis  this  places  on  less-technically
          oriented means of protection which  necessitates more reliance on
          user involvement.   Personal computers  typically do not  provide
          technical controls for such things  as user authorization, access
          controls, or memory protection that differentiates between system
          memory and memory used by user applications.  Because of the lack
          of controls and the resultant freedom  with which users can share
          and modify software, personal computers  are more prone to attack
          by viruses, unauthorized users, and related threats.

          Virus prevention in  the personal computer environment  must rely
          on  continual  user  awareness  to  adequately  detect  potential
          threats  and  then  to  contain  and  recover  from  the  damage.
          Personal  computer   users  are  in  essence   personal  computer
          managers, and must practice  their management as a part  of their
          general computing.   Personal computers generally do  not contain
          auditing features, thus  a user needs to be aware at all times of
          the computer's performance,  i.e., what it  is doing, or what  is
          normal or abnormal activity.  Ultimately, personal computer users
          need  to understand  some  of  the  technical  aspects  of  their
          computers in order to protect, deter,  contain, and recover.  Not
          all personal computer  users are technically oriented,  thus this
          poses  some  problems  and  places  even  more  emphasis on  user
          education and involvement in virus prevention.

          Because of the  dependance on user involvement,  policies for the
          personal  computer environment  are  more difficult  to implement
          than   in  the   multi-user  computer   environment.     However,
          emphasizing these  policies as part  of a user  education program
          will  help to ingrain them  in users' behavior.   Users should be
          shown  via  examples what  can happen  if  they don't  follow the
          policies.   An example where  users share  infected software  and
          then spread the  software throughout an organization  would serve
          to  effectively illustrate the point,  thus making the purpose of
          the policy more clear  and more likely  to be followed.   Another
          effective method for increasing user  cooperation is to create  a
          list of effective personal computer management practices specific
          to  each personal  computing environment.   Creating such  a list
          would save users the problem of determining how best to enact the


                                         5-1












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 5



          policies, and  would serve as  a convenient checklist  that users
          could reference as necessary.

          It will  likely be  years before  personal computers  incorporate
          strong  technical  controls  in  their  architectures.    In  the
          meantime,  managers  and  users  must  be  actively  involved  in
          protecting their computers from viruses and related threats.  The
          following sections provide guidance to help achieve that aim.


          5.1  General Policies

          Two general policies are suggested here.  The first requires that
          management  make  firm,  unambiguous decisions  as  to  how users
          should  operate  personal  computers, and  state  that  policy in
          writing.  This policy will be a general re-statement of all other
          policies affecting  personal computer use.  It  is important that
          users  read  this  policy  and  agree  to  its  conditions  as  a
          prerequisite  to personal  computer  use.   The  purposes of  the
          policy are to   (1) ensure that users are aware  of all policies,
          and (2) impress upon users the  need for their active involvement
          in computer security.

          The second policy is that every  personal computer should have an
          "owner"  or  "system   manager"  who   is  responsible  for   the
          maintenance and  security of the computer, and  for following all
          policies and  procedures associated with the use of the computer.
          It would be preferable that the primary user of the computer fill
          this  role.    It   would  not  be  too  extreme  to   make  this
          responsibility a part of the user's job description.  This policy
          will require that resources  be spent on educating users  so that
          they can adequately follow all policies and procedures.


          5.2  Software Management

          Due to the wide  variety of software available for  many types of
          personal computers, it  is especially important that  software be
          carefully controlled.  The following policies are suggested:

             o Use only licensed copies of  vendor software for personal
               computers.  Ensure  that the license numbers  are logged,
               that  warranty information is completed, and that updates
               or  update  notices  will be  mailed  to  the appropriate
               users.   Ensure that software versions are uniform on all
               personal  computers.     Purchase  software  from  known,
               reputable  sources  - do  not  purchase software  that is

                                         5-2












                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 5



               priced suspiciously low and do  not use pirated software,
               even on a  trial basis.   As possible, buy software  with
               built-in security features.

             o Do not install software that is  not clearly needed.  For
               example, software  tools such as  compilers or  debuggers
               should  not be installed  on machines where  they are not
               needed.

             o Store the original copies of  vendor software in a secure
               location for use when restoring the software.

             o Develop a clear policy for  use of public-domain software
               and  shareware.    It  is  recommended  that  the  policy
               prohibit   indiscriminate   downloading   from   software
               bulletin boards.   A  special isolated  system should  be                                             
               configured to  perform the  downloading, as  well as  for
               testing downloaded and other software  or shareware.  The
               operation  of  the   system  should   be  managed  by   a
               technically skilled user who can use anti-virus  software
               and other  techniques to test  new software before  it is
               released for use by other users.

             o Maintain   an   easily-updated   database  of   installed
               software.  For each type of software, the database should
               list the computers  where the software is  installed, the
               license numbers,  software  version  number,  the  vendor
               contact information, and the  responsible person for each
               computer listed.  This database should be used to quickly
               identify users, machines,  and software when problems  or
               emergencies  arise,  such as  when  a particular  type of
               software  is  discovered  to  contain  a virus  or  other
               harmful aspects.

             o Minimize software  sharing within  the organization.   Do
               not permit  software to be placed on computers unless the
               proper manager is  notified and the software  database is
               updated.    If computer  networks  permit software  to be
               mailed or otherwise transferred among machines,  prohibit
               this as a  policy.   Instruct users not  to run  software
               that has been mailed to them.

             o If using software repositories on LAN servers, set up the
               server  directory  such  that  users  can copy  from  the
               directory, but not add software to the directory.  Assign
               a  user to  manage  the repository;  all  updates to  the
               repository  should  be cleared  through  this individual.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 5



               The software  should be tested  on an isolated  system as
               described earlier.

             o If developing  software,  consider the  use  of  software
               management  and  control  programs  that automate  record
               keeping for software  updates, and that provide  a degree
               of protection  against unauthorized modifications  to the
               software under development.

             o Prohibit users from  using software  or disks from  their
               home  systems.   A  home system  that  is used  to access
               software bulletin boards  or that  uses shared copies  of
               software  could   be  infected  with   viruses  or  other
               malicious software.


          5.3  Technical Controls

          As stated earlier, personal computers suffer from a relative lack
          of technical controls.  There are  usually no mechanisms for user
          authentication  and   for  preventing  users  or   software  from
          modifying  system  and  application  software.    Generally,  all
          software  and  hardware is  accessible  by the  personal computer
          user, thus the potential for misuse is substantially greater than
          in the multi-user computer environment.

          However,  some  technical  controls  can  be  added  to  personal
          computers,  e.g., user  authentication  devices.   The  technical
          controls that do  not exist can  be simulated by other  controls,
          such  as a  lock  on an  office  door to  substitute  for a  user
          authentication device, or  anti-virus software to take  the place
          of system  auditing  software.   Lastly,  some  of  the  personal
          computer's accessibility can  be reduced, such as  by the removal
          of floppy diskette  drives or  by the use  of diskless  computers
          that  must  download  their software  from  a  LAN  server.   The
          following items are suggested:

             o Where technical controls exist, use them.   If basic file
               access  controls are available  to make  files read-only,
               make  sure   that  operating   system  files   and  other
               executable files  are marked  as read-only.   Use  write-
               protect  tabs on  floppy  diskettes and  tapes.   If  LAN
               access requires  a password,  ensure  that passwords  are
               used  carefully  - follow    the guidelines  for password
               usage presented in Chapter 4 or see [FIPS73].

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 5



             o Use  new cost-effective forms of user identification such
               as magnetic access cards.  Or,  setup other software such
               as   password  mechanism   that  at   a   minimum  deters
               unauthorized users.

             o If  using  a  LAN,  consider  downloading  the   personal
               computer's operating system and other applications from a
               read-only directory  on the  LAN server  (instead of  the
               personal  computer's hard  disk).   If the LAN  server is
               well  protected,  this  arrangement  would  significantly
               reduce chances  of  the software  becoming infected,  and
               would simplify software management.

             o Consider booting personal computers  from write-protected
               floppy diskettes (instead  of the computer's  hard disk).
               Use a unique diskette per computer, and keep the diskette
               secured when not in use.

             o Do not leave a personal  computer running but unattended.
               Lock the computer with a hardware  lock (if possible), or
               purchase vendor  add-on software  to "lock"  the keyboard
               using a password mechanism.   Alternatively, turn off the
               computer and lock  the office door.   Shut down and  lock
               the computer at the end of the day.

             o When using modems connected to personal computers, do not
               provide more access to  the computer than necessary.   If
               only dial-out service is required, configure the modem so
               that  it  won't  answer calls.    If  dial-in service  is
               necessary, consider  purchasing  modems  that  require  a
               password or  that use  a call-back mechanism  to force  a
               caller to call from  a telephone number that is  known to
               the modem.

             o Consider   using   "limited-use"  systems,   whereby  the
               capabilities of a system  are restricted to only what  is
               absolutely required.   For example, users who  run only a
               certain  application  (such  as  word-processor) may  not
               require  the flexibility of a personal  computer.  At the
               minimum,   do  not   install   applications  or   network
               connections where they are not needed.


          5.4  Monitoring

          Personal computer operating systems typically  do not provide any
          software or user monitoring/auditing features.  Monitoring, then,

                                         5-5












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 5



          is largely a user function whereby the user must be aware of what
          the computer is doing, such as when the computer is accessing the
          disk or  the general speed of its  response to commands, and then
          must decide whether  the activity is  normal or abnormal.   Anti-
          viral software can  be added to the  operating system and  run in
          such a way  that the software flags or in some  way alerts a user
          when suspicious activity occurs, such  as when critical files  or
          memory regions are written.

          Effective monitoring depends on user  education.  Users must know
          what constitutes normal  and abnormal activity on  their personal
          computers.  They need to have  a reporting structure available so
          that they can  alert an informed individual to  determine whether
          there is indeed a  problem.  They need to know the  steps to take
          to contain the damage,  and how to recover.   Thus, the following
          policies and procedures are recommended:

             o Form a team  of skilled  technical people to  investigate
               problems reported  by users.   This  same group  could be
               responsible for  other aspects of  virus prevention, such
               as testing new software and  handling the containment and
               recovery from virus-related incidents.  Ensure that users
               have quick access  to this group,  e.g., via a  telephone
               number.

             o Educate users so  that they are  familiar with how  their
               computers function.  Show  them how to use such  items as
               anti-viral  software.    Acquaint  them  with  how  their
               computers boot, what  files are loaded,  whether start-up
               batch files are executed, and so forth.

             o Users need  to watch  for changes  in patterns of  system
               activity.   They  need to  watch for  program loads  that
               suddenly   take  longer,   whether  disk   accesses  seem
               excessive  for simple  tasks, do  unusual error  messages
               occur, do access  lights for disks  turn on when no  disk
               activity  should  occur, is  less  memory  available than
               usual,  do files  disappear mysteriously,  is  there less
               disk space than normal?

             o Users also need  to examine whether important  files have
               changed  in size,  date, or  content.   Such files  would
               include the operating system, regularly-run applications,
               and other  batch files.    System sweep  programs may  be
               purchased  or built  to  perform  checksums  on  selected
               files, and then  to report whether changes  have occurred
               since the last time the program was run.

                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 5




             o Purchase virus prevention  software as applicable.   At a
               minimum,  use anti-viral  software to  test  new software
               before  releasing it  to other  users.   However,  do not
               download or use pirated copies of anti-viral software.

             o Always  report, log,  and investigate  security problems,
               even when the  problems appear  insignificant.  Then  use
               the log as input into regular  security reviews.  Use the
               reviews as a  means for  evaluating the effectiveness  of
               security policies and procedures.


          5.5  Contingency Planning

          As described in Chapter 3, backups  are the single most important
          contingency procedure.   It is especially important  to emphasize
          regular  backups  for personal  computers,  due to  their greater
          susceptibility  to misuse  and due  to the  usual requirement  of
          direct user involvement in  the backup procedure, unlike  that of
          multi-user computers.  Because of the second factor,  where users
          must directly  copy  files  to  one  or  more  floppy  diskettes,
          personal  computer  backups  are sometimes  ignored  or  not done
          completely.   To  help ensure  that backups  are done  regularly,
          external backup mechanisms that use a high-density tape cartridge
          can  be purchased and a user assigned to run the backup procedure
          on  a  regular  basis.    Additionally,  some  personal  computer
          networks  contain  a personal  computer  backup feature,  where a
          computer can directly access a network server's backup mechanism,
          sometimes in an  off-line mode at a selected time.  If neither of
          these  mechanisms are available, then users must be supplied with
          an adequate number of  diskettes to make complete backups  and to
          maintain a reasonable amount of backup history, with a minimum of
          several weeks.

          Users   should  maintain  the  original  installation  media  for
          software  applications and store it  in a secure  area, such as a
          locked cabinet, container, or desk.   If a user needs to  restore
          software, the user should  use only the original media;  the user
          should not use  any other type of  backup or a copy  belonging to
          another  user, as they could be  infected or damaged by some form
          of malicious software.

          The  effectiveness of a backup policy can  be judged by whether a
          user is  able  to recover  with a  minimum loss  of  data from  a
          situation whereby  the user would  have to format  the computer's
          disk and reload  all software.   Several  incidents of  malicious

                                         5-7












          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 5



          software have required that users go  to this length to recover -
          see [MACAFEE89].

          Other important contingency procedures are described below:

             o Maintain  a database  of  personal computer  information.
               Each record should  include items such as  the computer's
               configuration, i.e., network connections,  disks, modems,
               etc.,  the  computer's  location,  how  it is  used,  the
               software it runs, and the  name of the computer's primary
               user/manager.  Maintain this database to facilitate rapid
               communication and identification  when security  problems
               arise.

             o Create a security  distribution list for each  user.  The
               list  should include names  of people to  contact who can
               help identify the cause of unusual computer activity, and
               other appropriate  security  personnel  to  contact  when
               actual problems arise.

             o Create a group of skilled users who can respond to users'
               inquiries regarding virus  detection.  This  group should
               be  able to determine when  a computer has been attacked,
               and how best to contain and recover from the problem.

             o Set up some means of  distributing information rapidly to
               all affected users  in the event  of an emergency.   This
               should not rely  upon a computer network,  as the network
               could actually  be attacked,  but could  use other  means
               such  as  telephone   mail  or  a  general   announcement
               mechanism.

             o Observe physical security for personal computers.  Locate
               them  in  offices  that can  be  locked.    Do not  store
               software and backups in unsecured cabinets.



          5.6  Associated Network Concerns

          Personal  computer  networks  offer  many  advantages  to  users,
          however  they  must be  managed  carefully  so that  they  do not
          increase  vulnerability  to viruses  and  related threats.   Used
          incorrectly,   they   can  become   an   additional   pathway  to
          unauthorized  access  to  systems,  and  can  be  used  to  plant
          malicious software such as network worms.   This section does not
          provide specific management guidance, as there are many different

                                         5-8












                                       COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
                                                                  CHAPTER 5



          types of personal  computer networks with widely  varying degrees
          of similarity.   However, some general suggestions  for improving
          basic management are listed below:

             o Assign  a network  administrator, and  make the  required
               duties  part  of  the  administrator's  job  description.
               Personal  computer  networks  are  becoming  increasingly
               complex to administer, thus the administration should not
               be left  to an  individual who  cannot  dedicate time  as
               necessary.

             o Protect the network server(s) by  locating them in secure
               areas.    Make sure  that  physical access  is restricted
               during off-hours.  If possible, lock or remove a server's
               keyboard to prevent tampering.

             o Do not provide  for more than one  administrator account,
               i.e.,  do not give  other users administrator privileges.
               Similar  to  the  problem   of  multiple  system  manager
               accounts on  multi-user systems, this  situation makes it
               more likely that a password will become known,  and makes
               overall  management  more difficult  to  control.   Users
               should coordinate their requests through a single network
               administrator.

             o Do not permit users to connect personal computers to  the
               network cable  without  permission.    The  administrator
               should keep an updated diagram of the network's topology,
               complete with corresponding network addresses and users.

             o Use  the  network  monitoring tools  that  are available.
               Track network usage and access to resources, and pinpoint
               unauthorized access  attempts.   Take appropriate  action
               when violations consistently occur, such as requiring the
               user  in question  to  attend  a  network user  class  or
               disabling the user's network account.

             o Ensure that users know  how to properly use  the network.
               Show them how to use all  security features.  Ensure that
               users  know  how  to use  passwords  and  access controls
               effectively -  see [FIPS73] for  information on  password
               usage.    Show  them the  difference  between  normal and
               abnormal network activity  or response.   Encourage users
               to  contact  the  administrator  if they  detect  unusual
               activity.  Log and investigate all problems.

          COMPUTER VIRUSES AND RELATED THREATS
          CHAPTER 5



             o Do not give  users more access to  network resources than
               they require.   If  using shared  directories, make  them
               read-only  if write permission is not  required, or use a
               password.   Encourage  users to  do  the same  with their
               shared directories.

             o Do not set up directories  for software repository unless
               (1) someone can first verify whether the software is  not
               infected, and (2) users are not permitted to write to the
               directory without prior approval.

             o Backup the network  server(s) regularly.  If  possible or
               practical,  backup personal  computers using  the network
               server backup mechanism.

             o Disable  the  network  mail  facility  from  transferring
               executable  files,   if  possible.    This  will  prevent
               software from  being  indiscriminately  shared,  and  may
               prevent  network worm  programs  from accessing  personal
               computers.

             o For network guest or anonymous  accounts, limit the types
               of commands that can be executed.

             o Warn  network users to  be suspicious of  any messages or
               programs that  are received  from unidentified  sources -
               network  users  should  have  a  critical  and suspicious
               attitude  towards  anything   received  from  an  unknown
               source.

             o Always remove old  accounts or change passwords.   Change
               important  passwords  immediately  when  users leave  the
               organization or no longer require access to the network.
