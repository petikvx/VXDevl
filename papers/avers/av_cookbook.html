<H2>0) Introduction</H2>
The purpose of this document is to serve as an educational tool. I have
felt for a long time now that the computer virus is much like a headache
and that the average user should be able to administer proper anti-virus
techniques on their computer as easily as they administer Tylenol,
instead of having to run frantically to a specialist all the time
(especially since most of those same specialists make available several
tools that would take care of almost all the problems a user is likely
to encounter).
<P>
As such this document contains a lot of preventative measures and advice
for various decision making circumstances. This is the reasoning behind
the name of this document and behind it's format, as it is not intended
to go into detailed technical minutiae (unless warranted by obscure and
unbelievable circumstances) but instead to be an average-joe-friendly
document regarding secure measures for virus prevention, detection, and
recovery. Unfortunately it's not possible to get away with a complete
lack of technical terms - anything I feel isn't obvious I will explain in
the glossary at the end.
<P>
This is sort of an anti-FAQ, I don't present questions and then answers as
I don't feel that type of presentation is appropriate to reach people who
might not be sure they even need to know about this stuff let alone have
specific questions.
<P>
I'm also not going to go into great detail about what a virus is, many
documents already do that and the average person probably doesn't need
to know that.
<P>
A virus is just a kind of program (it can be any kind of program, not
just an *.exe / *.com file) and it has to be executed before it can do
anything. The two defining characteristics are that it has to
self-replicate (make copies of itself) and it requires a host program to
execute the virus when the host gets executed.
<P>
Now for a list of ingredients for an AV strategy.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="ACB01"></A>
<H2>1) Backups</H2>
These are deceptively important ingredients to a good AV strategy and
should be made religiously. They are, in fact, <B>the</B> most important
security procedure a user can perform.
<P>
Why should you back up your hard drive? Besides the obvious threat of
virus infection, there's also trojan horses, accidental deletion,
corruption due to buggy software, corruption due to power spikes,
corruption due to media failure, etc... Somewhere, at some point you
WILL need to restore from back ups, regardless of what precautions you
take.
<P>
What should you back up? Everything that you don't fully intend to
delete (which includes that which you're ambivalent about - you may find
a use for that pop-up 4 digit display calculator yet!). Default program
files are a must for backing up; personal data files can be remade to a
large extent but remaking the programs themselves is beyond the
abilities of most of us, you'd have to find them (or buy them) all over
again.
<P>
To save yourself hassle, though, personal data files should be backed up
too - but as you probably realize, data files change a lot so obviously
they need to be backed up regularly while programs themselves (which for
the most part shouldn't change at all) need only be backed up once. For
this reason it may (especially if you're doing the backup manually) be
easier to keep the two types of backups separate and save yourself a lot
of redundant effort.
<P>
Program backups (backups of the software itself) should likely be made
as soon as you acquire the software (scan it first though). Data
backups should be made on a regular basis, the interval between backups
being dependant on the average rate at which new data is generated and
the value of that data (ie. in a system where incredible amounts of very
valuable data are being produced, backups would probably take place
every day at least; a single home user who might generate a new text
file every week containing his/her shopping list probably wouldn't need
to backup that data more than once a month if at all but thats an
unlikely and rather artificial example). Data backups can also be
amalgamated (grouped together) into sets and stored for extended periods
of time before being replaced by the next set of data backups so that
small errors that grow with time but go unnoticed in early stages (like
what might occur on a system with a data diddler on it or simply with
progressive file corruption) don't contaminate the only backups you have
and render the data completely lost. In essence, you'd have a fixed
number of backups and the oldest one would be replaced by the one you
just made.
<P>
Backups can (obviously) be made on any writable media other than the
hard disk (there'd be no point in storing the copy in the same place as
the original as the copy would be just as insecure as the original),
that includes floppy disks, tape cartridges, magneto-optical-erasable or
floptical disks, SyQuest disks, Iomega ZIP or JAM disks, or even on
paper (though that would be tedious to restore to the hard drive should
it get lost - and you'd use up paper each time you made a new backup).
There are more extensive systems that make use of methods beyond the
scope of what we would conventionally think of as a backup (such as file
mirroring on separate media) but such systems are costly and few average
users would require such extensive measures.
<P>
Unfortunately every system is different and has different requirements,
and data has different value in different contexts so no hard and fast
rules about backups are possible - in this document it is only feasible
to stress their importance and give some general tips.
<P>

<A NAME="ACB02"></A>
<H2>2) Recovery Disks</H2>
Something that far too many people need but don't have are recovery
disks. These are disks that one uses with anti-virus software (possibly
even containing that anti-virus software) so that one can effectively
deal with computer viruses. The reason is that there are many viruses
now for which it is a requirement to boot from a clean bootable diskette
before removal of the virus is a viable option. Booting from a clean
disk removes memory resident viruses (and especially stealth viruses)
from memory. To that end, it's often best to make use of them whether
you have such a virus or not (it will be nearly impossible for the
average user to know for certain if it's required so just use this in
all cases).
<P>
To make a recovery disk set:
<P>
[BOOT disk]
<UL>
1) On a clean MS-DOS 6.X system insert a blank floppy disk in drive A:
and execute the command "FORMAT /S A:". The disk is now bootable.
<P>
You should now patch A:\IO.SYS by executing the commands<BR>
"ATTRIB -R -S -H A:\IO.SYS" and "DEBUG A:\IO.SYS". You should now
see a '-' prompt, type "d 2a18 2a1a" and press return. You should
see "07 72 03" somewhere around the middle of the output line. If
this is the case type the following lines:
<UL>
e 2a18<BR>
07 72 06<BR>
w<BR>
q<BR>
</UL>
and back at the DOS prompt:<BR>
ATTRIB +R +S +H A:\IO.SYS
<P>
If at any point where it says "you should see" if you didn't then
press enter until you get a '-' prompt, type "q" and then "ATTRIB +R
+S +H A:\IO.SYS". If you were unable to perform this patch it
doesn't matter all that much as is needed only in relatively rare
circumstances. <A HREF="#ACB02.01">*1*</A> See the end of this section.
<P>
2) Copy FORMAT.EXE on to the floppy (not for removing viruses but for
creating more recovery disks in case you need to do so when your
system is "dirty"). Copy DEBUG.EXE, SYS.COM, and FDISK.EXE to the
floppy for disaster recovery (not necessarily viral) for which you
will require instructions from an expert should such recovery become
necessary.
<P>
3) Copy HIMEM.SYS onto the floppy and create a CONFIG.SYS file on the
floppy containing this:<BR>
device=a:\himem.sys<BR>
dos=high<BR>
<P>
4) Write protect the disk (on 3-1/2" disks that means you can see
through the hole, on 5-1/4" disks this means the notch is covered) so
that if the disk is inserted into an infected system while a virus is
active the virus cannot infect the disk and render it useless.
<P>
5) Write down all the configuration information in your CMOS memory down
on a peice of paper to be stored with your recovery disk(s).
(CMOS memory holds configuration information and can usually be
accessed on 286+ computers during bootup by pressing 'Del' or 'Esc'
during the memory test.)
<P>
6) Clearly label the disk with a meaningful name (ie. Recovery Disk :
Bootable DOS 6.x)
<P>
7) Repeat this process (without the patch) on a clean Win95 system if
you need a Win95 boot disk (ie. if you're going to be working on a
Win95 system).
</UL>
[AV disk]
<UL>
8) Copy the necessary files from your anti-virus product on to a second
floppy. This may require more than one floppy disk depending on the
AV product.
<P>
9) Copy a backup of your clean Master Boot Record (MBR) and DOS Boot
Sector (DBS) on to the second floppy along with a program to restore
them to their proper locations. You will require special software to
make these backups as the MBR and DBS are not files and can not be
located inside of a filesystem.
<P>
10) Write protect this disk as you did the first one and give it a
meaningful label.
</UL>
[DECOMPRESSION disk]
<UL>
11) Copy the decompression tools you need to decompress new versions of
your anti-virus product on to a third floppy.
<P>
12) Write protect this disk as you did the first and give it a meaningful
label.
</UL>
To update an AV program on a recovery disk:
<UL>
1) Do a verified clean boot (discussed in a following section) with a
bootable recovery disk that matches your operating system (ie. use
the Win95/DOS 7.x boot disk if you run Win95).
<P>
2) Using the file decompression program on a recovery disk (specify
the full path to be sure - ie. A:\PKUNZIP.EXE) decompress the new
version of the anti-virus product on the hard drive.
<P>
3) Remove the write protection from the recovery disk containing the old
version of the anti-virus product, insert it into the drive and copy
the necessary files from the new version to the disk (overwriting the
old files in the process).
<P>
4) Replace the write protect tab on the disk in the write protected
position. (on 3 1/2" disks this means you can see through the hole,
on 5 1/4" disks this means that the notch in the side is covered)
</UL>
To update a compression program on a recovery disk:
<UL>
1) Do a verified clean boot with a bootable recovery disk that matches
your operating system.
<P>
2) Decompress the new compression program (usually they come in
self-extracting executable archives so all you have to do is execute
that - assuming it's already been scanned).
<P>
3) Remove the write protection from the recovery disk containing the old
version of the compression program, insert it into the drive and copy
the necessary files from the new version to the disk (overwriting the
old files in the process).
<P>
4) Replace the write protect tab on the disk in the write protected
position. (on 3 1/2' disks this means you can see through the hole,
on 5 1/4" disks this means that the notch in the side is covered)
</UL>
(Important Note: You cannot start making recovery disks on your computer
if your computer is already infected by a computer virus - make those
recovery disks NOW while you're still capable of doing so, otherwise
you're going to have to find someone else who isn't infected who can
make recovery disks for you.)
<P>
<A NAME="ACB02.01">*1*</A><BR>
This process (in particular the patching of A:\IO.SYS) is necessary
to deal with a security loophole that has existed in MS-DOS since
version 3.2 which would hang the computer when booted from the hard
disk or from a floppy disk.
<P>
The bug does not exist in current versions of PC-DOS or most other
non-MS operating systems so those can be used instead without the
patch (effectively the batch file should be reduced to include only
the first line in that case). In the case of Win95 users, I still
suggest using a DOS 6.X recovery disk to start because the above
patch may not work on Win95 and also because Win95 leaves a copy of
the MBR in a memory buffer even after a clean boot from a floppy -
which can interfer with the user's ability to use anti-virus
products on the drive (it causes false alarms in the case of MBR
infections). A bootable Win95/DOS7.x should be made aswell if that is
the operating system your computer is running on - so that you can
deal with the newer filesystems and long filenames if you have them.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="ACB03"></A>
<H2>3) Verified Clean Boot</H2>
That's right, "Verified". The clean boot commonly discussed isn't good
enough anymore (and hasn't been for some time - but people haven't
updated what they say yet).
<P>
A regular clean boot is a requirement for secure anti-virus scheme
because, in essense, the code that gets control first wins. If a virus
is already actively running in memory when a user attempts to apply a
software based anti-viral technique it is possible for the virus to
circumvent that technique, regardless of what it is or how complex it
is. The virus can do this before the software is allowed to run or
during the operation of the anti-viral software. A clean boot is a
hardware based anti-viral technique for removing all possible viruses
from the computer's memory so that subsequent software based av
techniques can't be actively circumvented. In theory is absolutely
secure if you know that the disk you're booting off of is clean but
there's a problem.
<P>
There exists a mechanism by which a virus can make sure it gets loaded
even when a simple clean boot is performed. It isn't magic, although it
may seem impossible at first. What happens is that a virus (typically
an MBR infector) making use of this technique changes the computers CMOS
to make sure that the computer attempts to boot off of the hard drive
(thus executing the virus) before checking the floppy drive (the default
behaviour, the behaviour necessary for a true clean boot, is the reverse
of this) regardless of whether or not a disk is put into drive A:. Apon
detecting the disk in drive A:, the MBR infector would continue the boot
from the floppy disk (instead of continuing from the hard disk) and make
it seem to the user as if s/he had just booted from the floppy. It is
now necessary to check an make sure this hasn't happened on your system
when you perform a clean boot.
<P>
As such the verified clean boot is as follows:
<UL>
1) Turn off the computer, do not press Ctrl-Alt-Del, do not hit the
reset button.
<P>
2) Insert a bootable recovery disk into drive A:.
<P>
3) Then turn the computer back on.
<P>
4) While the memory check is being performed press the key to bring up
the CMOS configuration menu (it should say which key to press -
usually it's either Del or Esc).
<P>
5) Verify that drive A: is installed and that it is the first drive
that the computer attempts to boot from (ie. make sure it's at the
begining of the boot sequence). Also turn off the BIOS virus
protection if it's activated. If the BIOS virus protection was set
on and/or the boot sequence was reversed deliberately for protection
(which is wise) they can be reset to those states <B>after</B> you're done
looking for viruses.
<P>
6) Exit from the configuration (saving any changes you needed to make)
and continue with the clean floppy boot process.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="ACB04"></A>
<H2>4) Anti-Virus Software (AV Software)</H2>
This is not an easy subject to communicate as there are several
different types of anti-virus software, some of which have broad general
purpose uses while others are better suited to specialized environments.
In later discussion only the first type will be mentioned but in this
section I'll discuss both.
<UL>
a. Scanners - There are a large number of them out there, they look for
specific viruses that they've been told how to look for (the
identifying characteristics are stored in a database that comes with
the product).
<P>
Scanners are the most widely used type of av product and the most
convenient because, if used properly, they can catch a virus before
it has a chance to affect your system and save you the trouble of
restoring your system to it's original condition. Some more
advanced scanners also know how to look for code that is commonly
used in viruses and thus alert you to the presence of a possible new
virus. This is called heuristic scanning and it doesn't always work
as advertized (it doesn't detect all new viruses and sometimes it
detects what it thinks "might" be a virus where there isn't one).
Never the less it's very useful technology and most of the better av
products out there now have heuristic capabilities.
<P>
b. Integrity Checkers - These are considered the most secure type of
anti-virus product even though in the most general sense it is not
an anti-virus product. Integrity checkers detect changes to files
and/or other system areas (like the MBR or DBS). Viruses (all
viruses) have to change something to infect - if they just sit
there, they aren't viruses, this is why integrity checking is useful
as an anti-virus measure because they can detect ALL viruses, not
just the ones in it's database. Unfortunately integrity checkers
can't tell you the name of the virus (or even if it really is a
virus - unless you use it to watch the virus produce offspring) and
they can only detect the virus AFTER it's done something, so that
you won't know there is a virus there until after you've become
infected. Also, an exhaustive check of the integrity of everything
on a system can be time consuming so these generally shouldn't be
used too often or productivity could suffer. A lesser known
implementation is directed integrity checking which checks only
certain key system areas and/or likely viral targets.
</UL>
The more specialized products are:
<UL>
c. Memory Resident Scanners - These are intended to catch viruses during
the normal operation of the computer. They slow down the computer
since they scan everything that gets executed or opened. They are
sometimes less accurate than the regular scanner, detecting less
viruses, and they can be circumvented by clever viruses. For these
reasons the memory resident scanner is primarily useful only in
situations where regular scanning of new materials isn't practical
such as a school computer lab, or in environments where it's
disadvantages aren't noticable (like WIN95, which affects the speed
a lot more than a memory resident or, more appropriately under
WIN95, a VxD scanner would).
<P>
d. Memory Resident Integrity Checkers - These are like memory resident
scanners except that they perform the function of an integrity
checker instead. They also have the same drawback as the memory
resident scanner with regards to using up system memory and slowing
down the computer, but if properly used some can prevent all changed
or as yet unvalidated software from being executed (ie. execution of
new software won't be allowed until you first check the software and
generate integrity information for it).
<P>
They are open to attack from multipartite infections, however, as
the boot infector instance of the multipartite virus will execute
before the memory resident integrity checker.
<P>
e. Behaviour Blockers - These are memory resident programs that monitor
system activities looking for anything that might be considered
virus activity. These can also be circumvented and since viruses
don't use any techniques unique to viruses, behaviour blockers can
warn you of a process even if it isn't viral.
<P>
f. Bait Files - These are used to catch viruses in the act of infecting
(the bait files themselves). They aren't particularly useful as
they can only catch certain types of viruses and even then not
always. They are much more useful to researchers who are studying
the a particular virus and can thus make a bait file with specific,
intelligently chosen characteristics.
<P>
g. Immunizers - Despite the name, these aren't very useful at all.
These are programs that add self-integrity checking code to all your
programs. This causes problems when such code is added to a program
that already checks it's own integrity (the program will no longer
run since it's been altered by new self-integrity checking code) and
this method can easily be circumvented by simply overwriting the
file when the virus infects it.
</UL>
The most important thing to remember with all software, though, is to
Read The F'ing Manual (RTFM). If you don't read it, you are bound to
have problems.
<P>
The second most important thing to remember is to update your software
regularly. Scanners typically come out with new versions or new
definitions files every month or so (there is one that does so every
week). Integrity checkers and other generic av software are often
updated less frequently, but keeping up to date is no less important in
those cases. As a general rule of thumb, unless you are keeping
constant tabs on the industry (thus making sure you hear about new
releases when they happen) don't go more than 2 months without looking
for a more recent version of your main av software. The detection rate
of the current version of your scanner can go down by as much as 10% or
more over that period just from the number of new viruses that come out
each month.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="ACB05"></A>
<H2>5) Strategy</H2>
The strategy you use can greatly affect the security of your system
against viruses and many people have only rudimentary or ad hoc 
strategies in place (if any). It's generally accepted in the Anti-Virus
community that the best strategy is the multi-layered approach which 
uses the strengths of one type of software (ie. integrity checking) to 
supplement and make up for the weaknesses in another type of software 
(ie. scanning).
<P>
At the moment I am aware of 6 basic layers that may or may not need to
be addressed depending on the needs and capabilities of the system:
<UL>
a. Problem Scanning - Scanning the entire system to determine if indeed
there is a virus already on the system and giving you options for
removal (ie. solving the virus problem you were having). Should be
done from a recovery disk.
<P>
b. Preventative Filtering - Scanning of all incoming materials (software
downloads, disks and CD's, even new computers) to weed out those few
that are infected.
<P>
c. Virus-Specific System Monitoring - Checking everything you access or
execute for viruses (as filtering may miss droppers or you may have
filtered improperly or forgotten).
<P>
d. Full Integrity Checking - The use of integrity checking to detect
new unknown viruses that would remain undetected by virus-specific
methods like scanning, and for locating viral changes such as files
corrupted by a virus' payload. Should be done from a recovery disk.
<P>
e. Generic System Monitoring - Using generic techniques (such as directed
integrity checking and/or baiting) to monitor key system areas and/or
likely viral targets. This should ideally be less computationally
intensive than a Full Integrity Check as it is meant to partially
replace it and hopefully lessen the performance hit that regular
Full Integrity Checks would have.
<P>
f. Recovery - Restoring programs, data, and the system in general to its
original uninfected state.
</UL>
Problem Scanning and Preventative Filtering are best accomplished by
known-virus scanners. Virus-Specific System Monitoring is best
accomplished using the VxD (Windows only) component (not a TSR) of the
known-virus scanner used for Problem Scanning and Preventative Filtering.
Full Integrity Checking should be done using a good, secure integrity
checker. Generic System Monitoring can be done using directed integrity
checkers or full integrity checkers if they are configurable enough.
Recovery is best done using back-ups, restoring by replacing affected
objects with known clean back-ups is the safest and most secure method of
recovery - though most people seem to prefer the convenience of
disinfection by a known-virus scanner (not realizing that it's not always
perfect or even possible).
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="ACB06"></A>
<H2>6) Recipes</H2>
What follows are the situations you should run into and what you should
do as far as anti-virus security when you do.
<UL>
1) Normal everyday computer use - Make backups regularly (the exact
schedule is dependant on the situation), verify the integrity of
your data with an integrity checker on a regular basis (a good idea
to do this BEFORE you make a new backup). The integrity checker
should be used from a bootable recovery disk if possible (so that
viruses can't attack the files that it stores which tell it what
your files are supposed to look like - and so that stealth viruses
can't hide their effects from it) after a verified clean boot.
<P>
You can run one of the memory resident anti-virus products and/or
generic system monitors aswell.
<P>
2) Reception of new software or disks or computer - Scan all new
materials coming into your system. Unpack compressed archives and
scan inside those (some scanners can do this by default with a
number of types of compression). Use a program like UNP to
decompress and/or decrypt runtime compressed/encrypted executables
and scan inside those (few scanners can do this automatically).
If these seem like measures you aren't sure you can remember to
follow every time you might want to get a hold of a program called
THDPro (along with all those unpacking utilities and scanners), as
it will automate much of this (and more) when correctly installed.
It won't automate everything though, you still have to tell it
what to scan, when you want it to check something - you can't rest
on your backside, there is no fully automatic security.
<P>
Then backup the new software (if warranted).
<P>
&lt;There are alternatives to THDPro, but be sure that the product you
choose is at least comparable to THDPro in terms of it's wide range
of scanners and compression types it can handle. Some newer scanners,
notably AVP, do have comparable functionality to THDPro.&gt;
<P>
3) Scanning the entire computer - Perform a verified clean boot from the
recovery disk with the scanner on it and execute the scanner. This
allows you to scan your files in a clean environment so that viruses
can neither hide from the scanner nor use the it to aid in infecting
every executable on your hard drive. It isn't often necessary to
scan the entire computer, usually only when you update your scanner,
or if integrity checking starts turning up changed executables -
otherwise step #2 should stop all known viruses before they get into
your system.
<P>
In the case of major device driven media (such as a Stacker,
Doublespace, or Speedstor drive) where the device drivers necessary
to access them aren't loaded during the verified clean boot - scan
the computer using the method above, and when everything turns up
clean reboot from the hard drive so that those drivers are loaded up
but nothing inside the device driven media is executed and then use
the scanner on the floppy to scan the device driven media (or if
you're clever, put the device drivers on the the recovery disk so
that you can access them after the clean boot - but beware, this
takes up space that could otherwise be used by anti-virus software).
<P>
In the case of Win95, perform the the above mentioned clean boot with
the DOS 6.x boot disk and scan or otherwise check the MBR and DBS for
viruses. Then boot from the Win95/DOS 7.x boot disk and check the
rest of the computer.
<P>
4) Integrity checking the entire computer - Again, perform a verified
clean boot from a recovery disk (so that stealth viruses cannot
circumvent the integrity checker) insert the disk with the integrity
checker and integrity data into the floppy drive and check the
system. This should be done regularly regardless of whether or not
the target system gets a lot of new files (integrity checking is a
good all around security measure, and besides which a time bomb in a
very old file could activate).
<P>
There may be some question as to whether the disk with the integrity
checker and data on it should be write protected or not - it should
except when you intend to actually use it (ie. remove the write
protection just before executing the integrity checker and then
restore it when the integrity checker has finished). This is so
that it doesn't get infected if it's accidentally put in the drive
when you haven't yet performed a clean boot (ie. you might put it in
by accident).
<P>
5) Disinfecting your system - Perform a verified clean boot and insert
the disk with the scanner on it and execute the scanner. Use it to
identify all infected objects on your hard disk. Use the
identification the scanner gives you to find out information on the
virus (such as data damaging effects other than infection - so that
you'll know whether it's likely that it's started to affect the
integrity of your backups - most viruses don't have such effects
however). Delete those affected objects and replace them from
backups. The disinfection capabilities in anti-virus software is
not perfect and can wind up screwing up a file even more, thats why
even the people who create the software suggest that you remove
viruses by deleting and replacing from known clean backups. The
disinfectors are to be used only if there's no other way.
<P>
If it's the MBR or bootsector that's infected, restore it from the
backups of them that you have on a recovery disk. If you don't have
a backup of your bootsector or MBR it will be necessary to use the
disinfection capability of your anti-virus program. These viruses
will infect floppies so it will be necessary to scan your floppy
disks and recover from those additional infections.
<P>
After everything is clean and working properly again, send the
company who makes your anti-virus program a note saying what virus
you had, how you cleaned it up, and how much you appreciate their
efforts in creating such great anti-virus tools. This will improve
their figures regarding which viruses are in the wild and how
prevalent they are, aswell as giving them an opportunity to have
someone reply if their's any additional procedures you should have
used or anything they feel you need to be made aware of. It also
makes some of them feel good to get the appreciation they so much
deserve.
<P>
6) Dealing with a recurring infection - Consider the possibility that
you haven't managed to clean up the infection entirely the first
time or that you have a dropper that was able to slip through step
#2. Bootsector and MBR infectors will infect floppy disks aswell so
after recovering the hard drive, check all your floppies. If it's a
recurring file infection it could be that you weren't strict enough
with your security and the backups got infected, or you could have a
dropper. Scan your all your backups (program and data backups since
macro viruses infect document files and they would be in your data)
to eliminate the possibility of infected backups and then use one or
more of the memory resident anti-virus products to hunt down
droppers by executing all your files one by one (droppers are files
that contain viruses but are designed so that scanners can't see the
virus even if it's a virus the scanner knows about). When you
finally execute the dropper the memory resident av programs should
warn you that the program is trying to do something you may not want
it to do.
<P>
If all this fails, question whether step #2 is being followed
strictly enough in all circumstances (you could be getting infected
files over and over again from someone you would otherwise 'trust' -
if so they should be alerted about the infection so that they can
clean up their system)
</UL>
Well, that's it for security, now to tie up some loose ends.

<H2>7) How to choose an AV Product</H2>
The scanner is a particularly difficult peice of software to choose. It
requires you to trust the evaluations of others because exceptionally
few people have the time or resources or know-how to do performance
tests on scanners, but it also requires you to know WHO to trust.
Magazine tests are a great source of misinformation, they have so many
faults it's not funny and I'll describe some of the worse ones here so
that you'll know a bad test when you see one. However, since there is
no single "best" virus scanner you might want to look at the top few as
opposed to the top one.
<UL>
The test bed size - This is the total number of <B>different</B> viruses
used in the test. Magazine tests tend to use a dozen or so viruses
that have popped up in the media. This really says nothing about
how many viruses a scanner detects since there are, at the time of
writing this document, about 12,000 different viruses for the PC.
If a particular scanner tested in such a manner detects all 12
viruses, it could be that those are the only 12 virues it can detect
(some scanners are almost this bad). Certainly when there are
12,000 viruses to avoid, a scanner that only detects 12 is also
something to avoid. Other tests (marginally better than those that
are done by computer magazines) may use a few hundred or even a few
thousand different viruses - but again, the majority of the viruses
won't be checked for detection. A 'Good' test requires that the
tester use relatively close to all the known viruses. Very few
people have access to such large collections.
<P>
Test bed integrity - Magazines tend not to check to make sure what they
think are viruses are actually viruses. This check involves making
sure each sample will infect something and that the newly infected
file in turn will infect something else. For all those samples that
don't do this their code must be checked by hand to see if it really
is a virus that just isn't compatible with the particular hardware
or software being used. Doing this for nearly 12,000 viruses is
beyond the scope of almost every magazine (there are one or two
specialty magazines/publications that is dedicated to the anti-virus
industry that <B>should</B> be capable of this) and most private
individuals aswell.
<P>
Rating criteria - Magazine tests tend to rate detection of viruses as
having almost equal importance to user-friendly interfaces and
scanning speed. A scanner is a security product, the security it
provides is in it's ability to detect viruses - therefore it's virus
detection rate is of prime importance, the interface and the speed
are only important if they happen to be incredibly poor (thus making
an otherwise excellent product practically unusable).
<P>
Products tested - Magazines tend to test a very limited number of
products, maybe as much as 25% of them in most cases leaving you to
guess about whether or not one of the ones they didn't mention is
far superior to all the ones they did mention.
</UL>
Some of the better respected independant tests in the industry have come
from places like the Virus Test Centre at the University of Hamburg and
the Virus Research Unit at the University of Tampere. Two other
organizations that perform well respected tests are Virus Bulletin and
Secure Computing. Look for tests from any of these organizations to
evaluate the detection rates of different scanners (tests performed by
end users themselves have notoriously poor testing protocols, and
usually have unreasonably small and unrepresentative collection of
viruses). Web sites for the above mentioned organisations are listed
below.

An integrity checker is even more difficult to choose since there aren't
any widely accepted methods for testing them. A good idea would be to
look for an integrity checker that can check all files as well as the
MBR and bootsector, and can store it's data on a floppy disk. Other
good qualities would be the ability to alert you when there is no
integrity data stored for a particular file/directory and the ability to
detect companion viruses generically. Another good quality to look for
in an integrity checker is what is called a key dependant algorithm
(sometimes simply described as a checksum or crc algorithm that is
uniquely chosen each time the software is installed.) These are things
you may have to read the manual carefully to find out about though, but
they are the main things to look for.

<H2>8) Virus Facts</H2>
A virus is just a special sort of program, not a magical glitch that can
do supernatural damage to your computer.
<P>
You can't get infected by a virus from 'reading' email.
<P>
No known virus has ever intentionally damaged hardware, nor is it likely
that they will do so in the future.
<P>
It is never necessary to format a hard drive to get rid of a virus, in
some instances this method won't even work.
<P>
Do not use the command "FDISK /MBR" unless specifically told to do so by
the author of an anti-virus product (and sometimes not even then).
<P>
There is no "best" anti-virus product and there likely never will be one,
there are only very good products and products you should probably just
ignore.
<P>
CMOS memory cannot be infected, only corrupted.

<H2>9) Glossary of Terms</H2>
Batch File - A script program made up of DOS commands and stored in
readable form in a file with the a '.BAT' after the filename.
<P>
Clean/Dirty - Words used to describe the state of infection that a
environment exhibits. A computer with no infection present is
clean and a computer with one or more infections present is
dirty. This can also be applied to floppy disks, boot processes,
etc.
<P>
CMOS - Complimentary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor: Used in IBM PC/AT
compatibles as a battery driven type of memory to store the
setup/configuration information about that computer.
<P>
Companion Virus - A specialized type of virus that doesn't modify its
host. Instead it creates its own file with the same file name as
the host but a different file extention that DOS will execute
first.
<P>
CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check: A technique for producing a string of
bytes that represent the input file (the string is usually much
smaller than the input file). The string of bytes are unique
enough to be used to distinguish one file from another (and thus
are useful for checking if the file changes as it would change the
file's CRC value). Checksums and cryptographic hash algorithms
are roughly equivalent to this.
<P>
DBS - DOS Bootsector: This peice of code is part of the operating system
(in this case part fo DOS). It loads the operating system's
kernel.
<P>
DEBUG.EXE - A program that comes with MS-DOS and is usually located in
the DOS directory.
<P>
Decompression - The reverse of the act of compression. In a computer
environment data and programs can be digitally compressed so as to
take up less storage space, but they must be decompressed to be
used.
<P>
Dropper - A program with a virus infected file hiden inside in such a
way as to escape detection by scanners until the dropper is
executed and injects the virus into the system.
<P>
Generic - In anti-virus terms it is used to categorize techniques that
don't require specific knowledge about the particular viruses they
can detect.
<P>
Infector - A word to indicate that a certain thing is a virus, usually
when declaring what type of virus it is (ie. a file infector is a
virus that infects files).
<P>
Kernel - The main controller part of the operating system.
<P>
MBR - Master Boot Record: This is a peice of code that makes sense out
the various drives you might have on a single physical hard disk
and passes control to the bootsector on the appropriate logical
drive.
<P>
Media - Something which information is represented/stored in/on.
<P>
Memory Resident - A term used to refer to the ability to remain active
in memory while the computer goes on to perform other tasks
(equivalent to TSR - Terminate and Stay Resident).
<P>
PATH - An environment variable defined in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It
lists the other directories that DOS will look in for a given
program besides the current directory when you attempt to execute
said program.
<P>
Patch - An ad hoc solution to a problem with a third party peice of
software.
