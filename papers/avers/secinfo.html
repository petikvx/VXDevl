        Information: Educating Users About Viruses</FONT></B></P>
      <P><A HREF="mailto:NEngelman@vet.com.au"><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Nicholas 
        Engelman</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">ABSTRACT</FONT></B></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Should end-users be educated 
        about viruses? When we ask them, most answer &quot;No&quot;. The prevailing 
        attitude seems to be that both viruses and anti-virus software are intrusions 
        into the work environment, and they should know as little about both as 
        possible. Viruses are someone else’s problem.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Currently, most organisations 
        appear to endorse this view. Corporate security policies invariably focus 
        on users as part of the problem definition, rather than part of the solution. 
        Hence their lists of &quot;thou shalt not&quot; procedures and their reliance 
        on automated anti-virus software.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">But is this attitude 
        reasonable? As administrators continue to report, their carefully written 
        security procedures and exhaustively evaluated Anti-Virus software aren’t 
        preventing new virus infections. Worldwide, businesses are reviewing both 
        strategies and software with increasing frequency, as viruses continue 
        to escape the net. In the eleven years since Brain first appeared, the 
        question has changed from &quot;We need to buy anti-what software?&quot; 
        to &quot;How many anti-virus products do we have to buy before we’re secure?&quot;</FONT></I></P>
      <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This paper argues that 
        it is in fact impossible to purchase such security; that anti-virus products 
        can at best provide only a partial solution, and that companies must turn 
        to their users to improve their protection.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Viral Arms 
        Race</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The Anti-virus industry 
        will never put an end to the virus problem.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Despite the occasional product 
        that claims to be a solution to viruses &quot;past, present and future&quot;, 
        and Alan Solomon’s (presumably tongue-in-cheek) assertion that if you 
        ‘Install on-access scanning … you can tell your users that it’s the end 
        of the virus problem’ [1], the reality is that computer users will continue 
        to be plagued by, and have to know how to deal with, viruses for the foreseeable 
        future.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It’s not for lack of resources, 
        or talent. It’s not out of economic self-interest. The problem lies in 
        the fact that we’re locked into an arms race. On one side we have the 
        Virus authors - a group whose motivations are murky at best, but whose 
        goal might be stated as &quot;wishing to propagate their viral creations 
        across other people’s systems.&quot; On the other we have the Anti-Virus 
        developers, whose goal is to prevent that propagation. This is a classic 
        example of an Escalating System [2]; the success of one side drives the 
        other side to respond. Thus a solution to &quot;in-clear&quot; viruses 
        leads to encrypted variants; as simple encryption is solved it gives way 
        to polymorphism; behaviour monitors lead to viral stealth; anti-emulation 
        and anti-heuristic techniques develop in direct response to their anti-virus 
        counterparts. Sometimes one side jumps ahead, sometimes the other - but 
        at no time does the escalation stop.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Such a system is difficult 
        to defuse. Unilateral or brokered &quot;disarmament&quot; are not options 
        - the virus authors have no reason to de-escalate, while clients of Anti-virus 
        solutions will not accept reduced protection. The chances of one side 
        annihilating the other also seem extremely low. Neither the sheer number 
        of viruses nor the new techniques they occasionally employ has stumped 
        the anti-virus community. Conversely, despite the significant range of 
        products and techniques available to detect and eradicate them, viruses 
        continue to proliferate.</FONT>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The system would probably 
        be self-sustaining even as stated; unfortunately two more factors conspire 
        to make it even worse.</FONT>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The first is a fairly obvious 
        consideration - the question of compatibility. For a virus to remain viable, 
        it need only work on a subset of the systems it encounters. In contrast, 
        anti-virus software must work on all the systems where that virus might 
        occur. This requirement immediately puts the anti-virus developers at 
        a disadvantage. Though they may produce a solution to viruses as fast 
        as they are written, they must also ensure that solution will work in 
        a world where adherence to standards is only to be found in text-books, 
        along with the Phoenix, honest used-car salesmen and other mythical beasts 
        [3].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The second factor is more 
        subtle, and has to do with perceptions of the role of the anti-virus industry 
        as a whole. For a number of reasons (most of them commercial), there has 
        been a gradual acceptance through the years of an extremely questionable 
        assumption - that anti-virus developers and vendors have<I> prime</I> 
        responsibility for securing systems against viruses.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This is an unreasonable 
        requirement. Even if the anti-virus industry were<I> developing</I> the 
        systems they are expected to protect, theory says it would be impossible 
        for them to foresee and secure against all possible attacks. As it is, 
        they’re trying to protect proprietary operating systems and programs produced 
        by third parties whose goal is more often openness and useability than 
        security. Such an environment both eases the way for new viral attacks 
        and increases the difficulty of producing solutions. The anti-virus industry 
        cannot hope to keep it permanently secure. At best it can provide information 
        and tools to allow users to keep it as secure as is possible.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The development of Word 
        macro viruses is an excellent illustration of this point. The WordBasic 
        macro language was both trivially easy to use, and immensely powerful. 
        Armed with example code, even non-programmers could quickly turn out a 
        working virus. Current evidence, in the flood of variants appearing worldwide, 
        suggests they did exactly this.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Though technically simply 
        another parasitic file virus, this particular attack was far from trivial 
        for the anti-virus industry. The Word file format was both convoluted 
        and proprietary; when information on the format was finally obtained from 
        the developers, it was less than complete. Four months after the release 
        of Winword.Concept, the Virus Bulletin editorial bemoaned this lack of 
        accurate information [4]; six months after that their comparative review 
        of Word Macro virus solutions revealed that vendors were still struggling 
        to develop a complete solution to the problem [5]. As if adding insult 
        to injury, Microsoft then released Office97, which introduced the new 
        Visual Basic for Applications 5<I> and</I> changed the way the macros 
        were stored, recreating the entire issue. And though a measure of built-in 
        protection was provided with the new product, the greater part of the 
        burden for securing the Office Suite remained in exactly the wrong place 
        - on the shoulders of the anti-virus industry.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This is not an isolated 
        example. The sheer pace of development, coupled with the commercially 
        sensitive nature of that development, will continue to create such problems; 
        the anti-virus industry will continue to require time to solve them. In 
        the space between, viruses will continue to slip past those anti-virus 
        products, and potentially onto user’s systems.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Our Eroding 
        Security Expectations</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Given the above situation, 
        it is hardly surprising that security expectations are dropping. Only 
        a handful of years ago, the goal of almost all businesses was never to 
        see a virus in their organisation. But as product succeeded product, and 
        still the viruses got through, that goal has been slowly revised down. 
        While corporates may continue to demand a &quot;complete solution&quot; 
        from Anti-Virus vendors, internal policy now accepts viral incidents will 
        occur. The focus has changed from totally preventing such incidents to 
        containing them, as is indicated in the following extracts:</FONT>
      <UL>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Given the variety and 
          pervasiveness of computer virus at present, it is impossible to completely 
          eliminate the threat of occurrence. -------’s best approach is to ensure 
          that virus are [sic] detected as soon as practicable, and deal with 
          them and their source in the most appropriate manner. [6]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">“Our goal is not to have 
          no alerts. There is no 100% solution … [so] if our anti-virus software 
          was generating zero alerts, we would assume it was missing viruses, 
          rather than we had solved the problem. Our goal is to find the viruses 
          with the minimum of damage” [7]</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">[We define a successful 
          implementation of an anti-virus application as] … a reduction of virus-related 
          problems from more than 85% of all help desk calls down to less than 
          10% of all help desk calls, because the viruses are intercepted before 
          they take residence in the computer systems [8]</FONT>
      </UL>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Is it reasonable for corporates 
        to aim at less than a 100% solution? Such an approach does seem reasonable 
        in light of the difficulties they’re facing. Consider the findings of 
        the1996 Information Security Survey [9]. Despite more than 90% using some 
        form of virus detection software, 63% of survey respondents reported virus-related 
        financial losses within the past two years. The same survey identified 
        viruses as the second ranked cause of financial loss related to information 
        security. With overall losses from dealing with viruses estimated to cost 
        organisations between $5-$6 Billion per year [10], it might even be argued 
        that a focus on<I> containing</I> virus incidents is simple pragmatism.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Such arguments sound convincing. 
        But are they acceptable? A virus infection costs a company in four distinct 
        areas:</FONT> 
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The immediate physical 
          cost, in terms of lost resources (the memory and storage space a virus 
          occupies)</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica"> The longer-term physical 
          and financial cost, in terms of lost man-hours to remove the virus and 
          repair any damage it may have done to company systems and data.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica"> The external psychological 
          cost, in terms of the damage the virus may cause to the reputation of 
          the business. This may be due to a failure of the business to operate 
          as it should (due to time and information the virus may have cost it), 
          and also to the loss of confidence that may arise if it becomes known 
          the company was infected at all.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica"> The internal psychological 
          cost, in terms of lost user confidence in their systems and security</FONT></LI>
      </UL>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Containment of viruses does 
        not prevent any of the above four costs; a policy based on containment 
        cannot even predict how much an incident will damage a company in each 
        of the four areas. Clearly, though security expectations with regard to 
        viruses may be dropping, security requirements remain unchanged. This 
        creates a conflict. The interesting question is, how are we to resolve 
        it?</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Redrawing 
        the Battle-Lines</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Our first level of defence 
        remains unchanged. Anti-Virus products will continue to provide excellent 
        front-line protection against viruses. There should be no doubt on this 
        point - when kept up-to-date and used correctly they are the best method 
        of protection available. Many products will even protect against so called 
        &quot;future&quot; viruses that follow existing lines of attack. What 
        they cannot provide, however, is guaranteed protection against all future 
        attacks; nor can they guarantee a timely solution when a new attack eventuates.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This gap between the coverage 
        provided by &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; solutions and corporate security 
        requirements is currently being filled by a combination of policy document 
        and Information Security Officer action. A basic policy will outline what 
        users can (and cannot) do on the system, as well as a procedure to follow 
        if they know or suspect they have a virus outbreak. The IS manager and 
        their team implement and support the suite of security packages they have 
        chosen to drive this policy. This is a typical hierarchical approach that 
        places responsibility with the experts and frees the users to get on with 
        their jobs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">However, while removing 
        responsibility from the users may be appropriate when it comes to configuring 
        and administering such areas as the network, database, accounting, mail 
        systems and so on, when it comes to anti-virus security it is not. Users 
        are not just part of the virus problem - they are also part of the solution, 
        and more must be done to encourage them to take up and work to this responsibility. 
        This, then, is where our new battle-line must be drawn. And the method 
        of drawing that line is to educate the end-user on how to keep the system 
        secure and virus free.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Unwilling Students 
        - Why Should End-Users Be Educated?</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">At the risk of sounding 
        glib, &quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Users know about viruses. 
        They’ve read about them in the press, and seen and heard about them on 
        the radio and television. They should have seen them mentioned in their 
        staff or procedural manuals. However, being aware of something and having 
        even a rudimentary understanding of it are two completely different issues. 
        Thus, though some users respond appropriately, we still have many users 
        formatting hard drives to get rid of both real and imagined infections, 
        using FDISK/MBR to &quot;clean&quot; Monkey infections, and forwarding 
        an ever increasing flood of hoax warnings, along with the perfectly valid 
        incident and false alarm reports. Worse still, many more do nothing at 
        all.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The central issue here is 
        that users generally have a high degree of autonomy when using their computers. 
        Where their access to critical network areas can be controlled from afar, 
        it is far more difficult to so strictly regulate their use of their desktop 
        systems. This means that their actions (and inaction) are critical to 
        the success of any anti-virus strategy, and they must increase their involvement 
        in security strategies if overall security is to be improved. Organisations 
        must generate a sense of responsibility in their staff for their own security; 
        without this, the best security policy will constitute so much paper. 
        And they must educate their users to a level that they are able to fulfil 
        this responsibility effectively - for without understanding, action will 
        be at best misdirected and at worst catastrophic.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Not surprisingly, users 
        already facing a full work load do not want to take up this responsibility. 
        In his 1995 case study of a &quot;large South African company&quot; Paul 
        Ducklin saw users rating themselves 2 nd in order of importance for controlling 
        viruses inside the organisation - yet less than 5% of potential delegates 
        attended the virus information sessions he ran [11]. This author’s own 
        experience is similar. In a 1996 review of security policy at PrivCorp, 
        a straw poll of the companies 1500 users saw them vote overwhelmingly 
        to leave anti-virus security entirely in the hands of the IS Managers. 
        If they can, they want to leave such considerations &quot;someone else’s 
        problem&quot;.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There are clear temptations 
        to accepting this view. Security is already seen as an overhead, and the 
        cost of an ongoing user education program will impact the budgetary bottom 
        line. Managers may well be tempted to gamble that the cost of a virus 
        incident will be less than the cost of the added security. For some this 
        may even be a good bet - many companies have minimal exposure to the current 
        viral threats.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Against this must be weighed 
        the benefits to be gained by having a workforce who understand the security 
        implications of their actions and who will act appropriately when they 
        believe they do have a virus incident. There is ample evidence to suggest 
        the benefits of such a workforce are high. The 1996 Information Security 
        Survey noted that the primary causes for financial loss related to information 
        security were ‘inadvertent errors and viruses’ [9]. The clear inference 
        is that such losses could be prevented, or at least reduced, if we educate 
        our users to avoid such errors, and to prevent viruses entering the system.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Elements of 
        a Successful Anti-Virus User Education Program</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">To be correctly targeted, 
        our education program must be built on top of the corporate security policy. 
        This policy will vary from company to company, but essentially will be 
        composed of a definition of the security threats the organisation is facing, 
        the products and procedures they intend to employ to meet those risks, 
        and the responsibilities of the various areas and personnel within the 
        company in dealing with these matters.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">For the purposes of the 
        discussion that follows, it is assumed that a hierarchical approach will 
        be taken to system security, with an IS Officer(s) responsible for keeping 
        up-to-date with threats and solutions, a technical team to ensure hardware 
        and software solutions are configured correctly and kept current, and 
        a help-desk to co-ordinate incident reports and response (It is recognised 
        that in some organisations all of these duties may fall to the one person). 
        In all but the smallest of organisations, the end-user will not be expected 
        to have even a limited expertise in virus matters. What is aimed at is 
        to deliver enough knowledge on the problem and the company’s policy and 
        solutions to it, to ensure the end-user is correctly playing their role 
        in meeting this security threat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Working from this baseline, 
        the successful user education program will include the following components:</FONT>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1. Introduction and Problem 
        Overview</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This section of the program 
        is essentially a &quot;state of the nation&quot; address. It will outline 
        the security threats the organisation is facing, the impact a security 
        breach could have on the company, and the general approach the organisation 
        is taking to meet these threats. To this end, it will be largely an introduction 
        to the security policy outlined above. To encourage the user to &quot;buy-in&quot; 
        to what follows, it should also appeal to them on a personal level - for 
        instance by painting a scene where a security breach might costs them 
        their time and work.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">2. General Description 
        of the User’s Role and Responsibilities</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The aim of this section 
        is to make the user realise this is a personal issue. Many of the audience 
        will be either intimidated by or highly resistant to learning about what 
        they see as a technical problem. They need to be made aware that their 
        actions directly impact the security of the company, and that they are 
        directly responsible for that impact. To this end, it must be made clear 
        they will be expected to understand and follow the policy guidelines.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">3. Introduction to the 
        “Enemy”</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In this section we aim to 
        provide users with a basic explanation of what viruses are and how they 
        work. This helps build a context within which the security procedures 
        may be understood; users are far more likely to comply with a requirement 
        not to boot the machine from drive A: when they understand how this action 
        can infect their PC. We can also use this section to debunk many of the 
        myths and much of the mystique surrounding viruses.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This section is not intended 
        to turn our end-users into virus experts. Rather, it is aimed at giving 
        them the minimum knowledge they need to understand the viral threat and 
        the role their actions play in both the problem and the solution. It is 
        similar to the sort of training we give to a new driver. The aim is not 
        to teach them the intimate details of how the engine works, but rather 
        to recognise when they’re out of petrol or the tyres are flat. With this 
        in mind, each of the topics listed should be kept at a level that the 
        least technical of the audience will be able to understand.</FONT></P>

      </UL>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">4. Discussion of Security 
        Risks in the Organisation</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This section is aimed squarely 
        at identifying the relative risks of various user actions and encouraging 
        users to modify their behaviour to reduce those risks. It will link the 
        information covered in section three to the specific environment of the 
        organisation, as well as tying-in to the company’s security policy. Vectors 
        of viral entry into the organisation will be discussed, along with the 
        general tools and techniques provided to close those avenues.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">5. Procedure and Solutions</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Here the tools and procedures 
        of the security policy are placed under the magnifying glass. This section 
        will include a discussion of how the various tools provided to detect 
        and remove viruses work, along with directions on how and when to use 
        them. It will make clear how they are configured and what they are (and 
        are not) covering, both in automated and manual operation. Once again, 
        required user actions will be related back to vectors of viral entry and 
        specific forms of viral attack.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This is also the point where 
        detection and reporting procedures will be discussed and demonstrated. 
        A report should always be generated when the anti-virus software believes 
        it has found a virus (either automatically or by the user); in this section 
        we will outline how and when users should report they<I> may</I> have 
        a virus. The aim here is to turn our users into &quot;responsible hypochondriacs&quot; 
        [12]. Our reporting and escalation strategy will determine how this works, 
        but essentially what we want is that users report suspicious behaviour 
        to the appropriate source. This has the double advantage of raising the 
        probability that virus incidents will be discovered early while preventing 
        the flood of hoax messages, by ensuring they are forwarded to the appropriate 
        point and nowhere else.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">6. Ethics and Duty</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Anti-virus education and 
        policy should also extend to a consideration of &quot;ethics&quot; and 
        &quot;duty&quot;. It is not appropriate for users to be accessing virus 
        sites and/or conducting their own tests with live viruses. Nor should 
        they be collecting virus samples, playing with virus creation kits, or 
        writing their own viruses. As already mentioned, there is strong empirical 
        evidence that the current flood of macro virus variants is at least in 
        part due to the fact that &quot;common&quot; users can (and do) examine 
        and edit the macro viruses they have found on their system, infecting 
        themselves and moving the new variant into the &quot;wild&quot;. It must 
        be made clear why such behaviour is unacceptable.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">7. Hands-On</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Ideally, users will get 
        the opportunity to experiment with what they’ve learned in a controlled 
        environment. At a minimum they should be able to experience the messages 
        and warnings their anti-virus products generate when they give an alert, 
        so they understand what to expect. This is the equivalent of a fire-drill; 
        it allows the user to tie the propositional or abstract learning of the 
        above sections to their direct experience, thereby cementing the lesson 
        on both levels [13].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Such hands-on training can 
        be extended all the way to infecting &quot;sacrificial&quot; machines 
        with real viruses. This has the added advantage of reinforcing the message 
        (which should have been made clear throughout) that viruses generally 
        do not play tunes, send messages etcetera when they infect your machine 
        at the same time it allows users to experience an infection cycle first-hand. 
        Such an approach must only be adopted in a completely controlled and secure 
        environment. A number of anti-virus vendors run live virus workshops for 
        exactly this purpose.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">8. Follow-Up</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Any education program risks 
        being simply an information dump unless there is appropriate follow-up 
        and reinforcement of the information learned. Suggested techniques include:</FONT> 
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Action Cards to be kept on users desks, 
          which list the minimum actions a user should take if they suspect they 
          have a virus, plus the policy points that define what they should and 
          should not do to prevent a virus attack</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Regular email or memos to users advising 
          them when their anti-virus software has been updated, and recapitulating 
          a particular security consideration, gradually cycling through the above 
          list of topics</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Analyses of any security breaches that 
          occur, and how they can be prevented</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Reports of the success of the security 
          policy - for example, a regular report of the number of viruses detected 
          before they could make it in to the system</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"> Immediate notification of changes to 
          the security situation (such as a new type of virus, or a new anti-virus 
          tool). Preferably a dedicated training session to address the new threat</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Pre-emptive notification of hoax messages</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Refresher training programs</FONT>
      </UL>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&quot;Higher&quot; 
        Education</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The virus problem is a dynamic 
        one. To remain successful, corporate anti-virus policy and procedures 
        must be similarly dynamic. Thus, while the education program outlined 
        for the end-user is focussed firmly on developing understanding of and 
        compliance with these procedures, at the next level up it must focus on 
        currency, to ensure these procedures remain correct and sufficient to 
        meet each threat as soon as (or preferably before) it develops.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This currency comes from 
        using to the full the services provided by the anti-virus community. Specialist 
        journals such as Virus Bulletin and Secure Computing will alert IS managers 
        to the most recent threats, but the first source of information will often 
        be the anti-virus vendors whose products the company has purchased. Even 
        if these companies cannot provide an immediate software or hardware solution 
        to a new problem, they can almost always provide a behavioural solution 
        to fill the gap while the anti-virus tool is being developed and implemented.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Such a solution can range 
        from something as simple as a warning not to download a particular file 
        posted to a series of Usenet groups (as in the case of Hare Krsna, which 
        was distributed via posts to alt.cracks, alt.crackers, alt.sex and alt.comp.shareware) 
        to a complete paradigm shift, as was required when macro viruses first 
        appeared (For years the anti-virus community had been reassuring users 
        they couldn’t &quot;catch&quot; a virus from a &quot;data file&quot; such 
        as a document or spreadsheet. The appearance of Word and Excel macro viruses 
        made this advice incorrect. They lead to a reassessment of what could 
        constitute a viral threat; as well as requiring an update to the anti-virus 
        tools, they also required a change in how those tools were used - from 
        checking executable files only to checking all files.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In all cases, the corporate 
        security policy must be modified immediately and appropriately to meet 
        the new threat, and the changes communicated down to the end-users as 
        quickly as possible. Without such an ongoing process, security will not 
        be achieved.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Conclusions</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Viruses are, and for the 
        foreseeable future will continue to be, a significant risk to computer 
        security. Anti-virus products are at best able to reduce this risk; because 
        of the dynamic nature of the computer industry, and the lack of adherence 
        to standards within that industry, it is extremely likely that new viral 
        attacks will continue to appear that circumvent existing product solutions. 
        Recognition of this fact is not, however, an excuse for companies to drop 
        their security expectations. This is particularly true given the unpredictable 
        nature of the damage a virus outbreak can cause, both in measurable and 
        less tangible areas. Companies cannot afford to gamble when the ultimate 
        cost may be their long-term viability.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Instead, companies must 
        accept more of the responsibility for completing their anti-virus defences. 
        While continuing to press for complete and timely solutions from anti-virus 
        vendors, they must also recognise that internal policy and user action 
        (and inaction) are often responsible for a security breach, and act to 
        address these areas.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The traditional approach 
        of imposing and enforcing a solution from above, which has worked well 
        in areas such as network implementation and management, has not proved 
        successful when applied to the virus problem. This failure is largely 
        due to the fact that many elements of the imposed security procedures 
        can not be automatically enforced when it comes to viruses. Corporates 
        must therefore treat users as part of the solution as well as the problem, 
        and actively seek to engage user compliance with their procedures if they 
        are to reduce virus incidents. The best way of securing this compliance 
        is to educate the user on how viruses work (so that they understand the 
        problem) and how and why the procedures will prevent them. The aim is 
        to build sufficient understanding of both the problem and the solution 
        that procedures will be voluntarily followed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, companies must 
        endeavour to keep their security policies up-to-date. This can best be 
        achieved by following the relevant journals and keeping in close contact 
        with anti-virus experts (typically these will be the vendors from whom 
        they have purchased their anti-virus solutions). The combination of correctly 
        implemented anti-virus products with a current policy document and an 
        informed and responsible user community gives the best chance of keeping 
        computers virus free.</FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">An typical example of the compatibility 
        problem was the arrival of IDE drives with capacities greater than 528 
        MB. Such drives were not supported by existing BIOSes, and required an 
        extension that was loaded as part of the boot process. This &quot;extension&quot; 
        code was written to the &quot;traditionally&quot; blank sectors immediately 
        following the Master Boot Record on track zero of the hard drive, and 
        immediately created problems for many anti-virus software packages, by 
        &quot;stealthing&quot; reads to the Master Boot Record through its control 
        of interrupt 13h. The fact that the driver code tended to be damaged when 
        a virus infected such a drive also became a problem for the anti-virus 
        industry. For a full description of this issue, see Riordan, R. &quot;Data

        that 54% of Australia’s heart attack victims delay seeking treatment by 
        six hours or more. Two reasons were discovered for this behaviour. Many 
        of the patients failed to recognise the symptoms of the heart-attack, 
        waiting until they were completely overwhelming before acting. The other 
        significant reason was that victims &quot;appeared to go into denial, 
        with even previous victims waiting to see if symptoms would go away or 
        feeling too embarrassed to ask for help&quot;. There is a clear and direct 
        analogy between this behaviour and that of users suffering a virus attack 
        on their PC. The solution is the same in both cases - educate the victim 
        to report their symptoms earlier rather than later.</FONT></P>
