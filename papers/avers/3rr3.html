<font face="Arial" size="5"><p>Viruses, Worms and Biodiversity in Computer Systems</p>
<p>By Amy Palke, Mills College</p>
</font><b><font size="5"></font></b></p><p><b><font size="5">Introduction: What is "biodiversity in computer systems"?</font></b></p><dir>

<p>Computer systems, from hardware to operating systems to software,
have largely been designed to work in a predictable, consistent manner
in order to provide compatibility and ease of use. As a result, there
are currently millions of nearly identical computer systems throughout
the world. For example, of 39 million web sites surveyed by Netcraft,
90% are running one of two web server applications, Apache (62.51%) or
Microsoft Internet Information Services (27.44%) [19]. This
consistent-and-compatible philosophy has made it easier to build
software, but it has also made it easier to build malicious viruses and
worms.</p>
<p>In nature, a species without much genetic diversity is at a high
risk for being decimated by a single disease. Since the various members
don&#8217;t have unique defenses that could protect them, all members of the
species may be susceptible to the same disease. In computer systems, we
face the same problems. If a weakness or "hole" is identified in an
application or operating system, someone can write a virus that can
successfully attack and disrupt a massive number of computers.</p>
<p>As huge numbers of computers all over the world have become
networked together, it has become possible to spread a single computer
disease throughout the world in a manner of minutes. The recent SQL
Slammer worm took roughly 10 minutes to spread across the world, and
infected more than 90 percent of vulnerable hosts [9]. The SQL Slammer
epidemic is an example of the risks faced by a non-diverse application.
</p>
<p>One possible way to protect computer systems from succumbing to an
attack is to introduce more diversity into the systems. If computers
were injected with more diversity, fewer computers would share the same
vulnerabilities, and it would be difficult to create a malicious
program capable of widespread infestation. </p>
<p>Diversity will add complexity, which could mean more work for
programmers, IT personnel, and end users. This means that diversity
will only be embraced if its costs are out-weighed by its benefits. In
order to understand the current and potential cost of monoculture
computer systems, we need to first understand how viruses and worms
work, and better understand their destructive capabilities.</p></dir>

<b><font size="5"></font></b><p><b><font size="5">Understanding viruses and worms</font></b></p><dir>

<p>A distinction is usually made between viruses and worms. A virus is
described as a piece of code embedded inside of an otherwise benign
program. The virus-infected program is then either inadvertently
distributed by users, or deliberately distributed by additional virus
code. A worm is an independent program, which typically does not have
to be activated by the user in order to start running. Once running,
the worm tries to propagate itself to new host machines over the
network.</p>
<p>Both viruses and worms may contain intentionally destructive code,
often called a "payload". However many contain no malicious code at
all, their intent being simply to spread themselves. Even without
malicious code, viruses and worms can cause great damage as they spread
around the world, clogging up the Internet and company mail servers. To
better understand the effects of these programs in general, we will
examine a few of them in more detail.</p></dir>

<b><font size="5"></font></b><p><b><font size="5">Notable worms and viruses</font></b></p><dir>

<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>The first worm</p>
</font></b><p>In 1978 at Xerox PARC, John Shoch was analyzing network
traffic patterns, and wanted to install a program to assist him on all
200 Altos in the network [1]. He decided to write a self-loading
program that could seek out new hosts, to save himself the effort of
wandering around the office, installing the program manually on each
machine. </p>
<p>Shoch let his worm loose one evening, and returned to work the next
day to find all of the computers in his research center had crashed.
When the computers were restarted, they quickly crashed again as the
worm started up and continued its search for new hosts. Fortunately
Shoch had added "self-destruct" code to his worm, and was able to kill
off the worm by sending a command over the network.</p>
<p>From their earliest incarnations, it was clear that worms had the
potential to cause massive damage even if they contained no
deliberately malicious payload.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Chernobyl virus</p>
</font></b><p>In June of 1998 a particularly malicious virus called
Chernobyl started spreading around the world in infected Windows 95 and
Windows 98 executable files [11]. Running an infected program caused
the virus to begin running, first copying itself to all of the other
.exe files on the computer. The virus code was extremely small, around
1kB, and it attached itself to executables in such a manner that the
size of the executable did not grow at all.</p>
<p>Chernobyl&#8217;s initial infection often went unnoticed, but on April 28<sup>th</sup>,
the code would become extremely destructive. First the code would
overwrite the entire hard disk, and next it would attempt to overwrite
the computer&#8217;s flash BIOS chip. If the flash BIOS chip were
overwritten, the computer would not be able to boot up.</p>
<p>Many people and several companies inadvertently spread Chernobyl
around the world. Yamaha shipped an infected software update file for
their CD-R400 drives, and IBM shipped a batch of infected Aptiva PCs
during March of 1999, just one month prior to the destructive trigger
date [11].</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Lovebug/ILOVEYOU worm</p>
</font></b><p>Worms typically utilize a weakness in software code that
allows the worm code to run, but in May of 2000, a worm appeared that
took advantage of a human weakness, instead of relying on a computer
weakness. The Lovebug worm appeared in an email that stated, "kindly
check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me." and contained an
attached file named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs" [11]. Hundreds of
thousands of hopeful users double-clicked the attachment, only to find
that instead of having a secret admirer, they were host to a malicious
worm.</p>
<p>The "love letter" attachment was a Microsoft Visual Basic Script,
and if the host machine was running Microsoft Outlook, the worm sent an
identical email with the love letter message and worm attachment to all
email addresses in the Outlook Address Book. </p>
<p>The worm created a huge load on office email servers, sending out
emails and filling up mailboxes. Many large companies and institutions,
including the US Senate, were forced to take their mail servers offline
[18]. According to the research firm Computer Economics, the Lovebug
virus is estimated to have cost a total of $8.75 billion for clean up
efforts and loss of productivity [10].</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Sapphire/SQL Slammer worm</p>
</font></b><p>On Saturday January 25th, 2003, at 5:30am GMT, the
fastest spreading worm to date began infecting machines running
Microsoft SQL Server or MSDE 2000 (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine)
[9]. Within 10 minutes the worm had infected 90% of vulnerable hosts,
over 75,000 computers. At its peak, the worm was doubling the total
number of infected machines every 8.5 seconds.</p>
<p>The Sapphire worm took advantage of a buffer overflow vulnerability
in SQL Server, overwriting the return address on the stack to cause
worm code to be executed. The worm code was never written to disk, so
rebooting the machine would eliminate the infection, but without
repairing the underlying vulnerability the machine would continue to
become re-infected.</p>
<p>Although the Sapphire worm had no destructive payload, it caused
massive worldwide problems. Soon after it started spreading, packet
loss across the entire Internet was nearly 20%, and 5 of the 13 main
domain name servers were down [11]. Many local area networks were
impacted as well when one of their machines became infected, and the
worm began to monopolize network traffic. Some 911 call centers were
forced to use paper and pencil to track calls, and many ATMs throughout
the world were out of commission [22].</p></dir>

<b><font size="5"></font></b><p><b><font size="5">The threat of viruses and worms</font></b></p><dir>

<p>After examining several specific viruses and worms, we can take a
step back to better understand the general concepts of how these
programs work and the potential they have for causing widespread damage.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Monoculture computer systems </p>
</font></b><p>Most viruses and worms can operate on only one type of
operating system, and most take advantage of vulnerabilities in a
particular software application. Since a single operating system or
application may be used by millions of users, a vulnerability found on
one system is likely to be found on millions. Therefore the task of
writing a malicious program that could affect millions of computers is
much more simple than if computers had to be attacked one by one.</p>
<p>Companies tend to standardize on one specific operating system, one
specific email program, one specific program for creating documents,
etc. These standards are designed to reduce IT costs, and to enable
information to spread easily within the company. However, this
monoculture also allows viruses and worms to spread quickly and easily
within a company.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Rapid infestation</p>
</font></b><p>When viruses were first developed, they had to travel
from machine to machine via floppy disk, or later through infected
executables downloaded from bulletin boards. It took a long time for a
virus to spread this way, allowing time for word of the virus to
spread, and for users to take preventative measures to avoid becoming
infected.</p>
<p>As computers throughout the world became networked together through
the Internet, it became much quicker for a virus or worm to spread
throughout the world, rapidly creating an epidemic. One infected
machine can spread its infection to all of the machines it knows how to
reach, and so on. To further complicate matters, the Internet has
linked home, hobby and business computers together, all with varying
levels of attention to security concerns and updates. </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Potential damage</p>
</font></b><p>So far, most widespread viruses and worms have not had
much in the way of a malicious payload. Many had no specific malicious
intentions, but their rapid spreading caused networks to be overloaded
and shut down.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that the potential for damage is huge. If the
Lovebug worm had overwritten hard drives, or BIOS chips like Chernobyl,
massive amounts of data would have been lost forever, and many
computers would have been rendered useless to their owners.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Ineffective security systems</p>
</font></b><p>Traditional security measures, such as virus scanners and
firewalls, have failed to provide adequate defense against many
malicious programs. Once a virus or worm has been identified,
virus-scanning software is updated, and software patches are created
and applied. This prevents systems from becoming re-infected with the
same program, and often prevents infections from similar programs, but
it does nothing to prevent the initial outbreak. Firewalls protected
many computers from the Sapphire worm, but firewalls are not effective
protection if the attack is based on a public network service.</p>
<p>With the Sapphire worm, it became clear that planning to protect yourself <i>after</i>
an outbreak had started was unrealistic, no matter how quickly you
could respond. Sapphire&#8217;s rapid worldwide spread (10 minutes) meant
there was no chance that anyone could get word of the worm and take
protective measures in time to prevent the infestation. In order to
truly protect computers from infection, a new methodology is required.</p></dir>

<b><font size="5"></font></b><p><b><font size="5">Introducing and encouraging diversity</font></b></p><dir>

<p>Past experience demonstrates that viruses and worms pose a huge
threat to the computer systems in the world. Likewise it is clear that
the current methods employed to prevent infections simply aren&#8217;t
working. While most security experts focus on writing better virus
scanning software and keeping security patches up to date, a few others
are exploring a different model for security. This model is based on
ideas found in biology, and its goal is to create systems that may be
immune to future infections.</p>
<p>The key idea behind computer diversity is to avoid unnecessary
consistency across computers. There are often many, slightly different
ways that programs can execute at a low level while providing the same
high-level functionality. Therefore it should be possible to create an
application with consistent, predictable high-level behavior, while
removing arbitrary low-level consistencies. </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Memory location protection</p>
</font></b><p>Memory is allocated to programs in a particular,
consistent manner, but this consistency is not mandatory for the
programs to run successfully. The allocation strategy could be changed
to provide randomization that would make it much harder for viruses and
worms to take advantage of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. One
possible change is to insert a random amount of padding in each stack
frame, causing return addresses to be stored in unpredictable locations
[12][17]. </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Randomized compilation techniques</p>
</font></b><p>When a program is compiled, many arbitrary decisions are
made. High-level code could be compiled into many different, but
functionally identical lines of machine code. However, currently the
same lines of high-level code will always be compiled into the same
lines of machine code. Similarly, the order of the machine code could
often be arranged in several ways, with identical functionality, but
current compilers won&#8217;t arbitrarily choose different orderings. If
compilers were changed to produce arbitrarily different, but
functionally identical code with each compile, they could create a set
of diverse executables with identical functionality [4][12]. </p>
<p>This diversity would likely make it much more difficult for a virus
or worm programmer to create a single program that could attack all of
the different binary versions of the program. Some of the binaries
might be immune to the attack, which would slow or halt its progress.</p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Program evolution</p>
</font></b><p>The term "security through obscurity" is often associated
with the idea of keeping key details proprietary in order to provide
security. The problem with this method is that once your secret is out,
your security is gone. </p>
<p>Obscurity can provide a good deal of security however, if the hidden
details do not remain constant. Security expert Fred Cohen advocates
creating operating systems and programs that constantly alter
themselves in order to provide obscurity [4]. A self-modifying program
could evolve or change itself slightly with each system call. This
would make even a targeted attack against a particular machine
difficult, as a particular vulnerability found one day might not exist
in the same spot on the following day. </p>
<b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Diverse operating systems and software</p>
</font></b><p>In February 2003, one of the 13 DNS root servers began
running a different name server software application. Prior to this,
all root servers used the same application. According to the
administrators running this root server, "the change was designed to
increase the diversity of software in the root name server system, the
lack of which is widely considered to be a potential vulnerability."
[23]</p></dir>

<b><font size="5"></font></b><p><b><font size="5">The problems and payoffs of diversity</font></b></p><dir>

<p>Any attempt to diversify computer systems will add complexity to
developing software and maintaining the IT systems at a company. At the
moment, diversity is not widely viewed as cost effective. The cost
benefits are currently hard to weigh, as most companies have not been
tracking and budgeting the costs of recovering from virus and worm
attacks. Likewise people may be underestimating the destructive
capabilities of viruses and worms, thereby underestimating the cost of
recovery.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that a particularly deadly virus or worm will
surface at some point. When the damage has been severe enough that the
cost of recovering from an attack is perceived to be greater than the
cost of preventing an attack, then perhaps more people will think
seriously about the potential benefits of diversity. It would be
unfortunate if a catastrophic event were required for the economic
benefits of diversity to become apparent to all.</p>
