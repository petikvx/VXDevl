This article will outline, and explain, a checklist of steps that any
computer user can take to reduce the risk of computer viral program infection,
and increase the chances of detecting an infection early -- hopefully before it
has much chance to do any damage.

<A NAME="A00"></A>
<H2>For each computer</H2>
I really feel that the following list is reasonable, achievable and necessary
for each individual computer. All of the items, with one exception, can be
obtained by any intermediate user with only the software supplied with the
computer. Most of the items should be done in any case as they are good
"technical support" practice.
<A NAME="A01"></A>
<H3>Directory list of all program files, date and size</H3>
This, of course, is completely straightforward, and yet it is so seldom done.
Yet the vast majority of file infecting viri would be instantly detected by a
comparison between the original "clean" list and a directory listing taken
after an infection. For best results, of course, other factors are needed,
which will be covered in due course.
<A NAME="A02"></A>
<H3>List of programs run at startup</H3>
With the number of "background" and "resident" programs running on computers
today, it's a wonder <I>anything</I> can operate at all. If you don't know what
your computer is supposed to be running, how on earth do you know when
something unusual creeps in?
<P>
For the MSDOS world, this list can be obtained simply by printing a copy of
the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. It may be felt that, because these files
are present on the computer anyway, it is redundant to print them out. A fair
point, but a booklet of this information at each computer will save time and
trouble all round.
<A NAME="A03"></A>
<H3>"Source code" for menus</H3>
These days the computer vendor/reseller or a technical support person installs
the computer hardware and software, and then installs a simple menuing system
for the user. It is not always obvious, from the disk structure, which program
the user may be using on a regular basis.
<A NAME="A04"></A>
<H3>Description of boot sector</H3>
By a description I mean something as simple as a copy on a separate diskette
or a "hex dump" listing. But even this is a formidable object for a novice user
to understand, let alone produce.
<P>
This, however, is not an insurmountable objection. The user does <B>not</B>
have to understand what the listing means, only that a change occurs. As for
generating the listing, that can be done by the qualified people who install
the system. With DEBUG on the system, batch files can be written to show the
user the first few lines of the current boot sector. It might also be a good
idea to have printouts (of the most common) and batch files to check the boot
sectors of floppy disks.
<A NAME="A05"></A>
<H3>Description of partition boot record</H3>
Similar objections will be raised, and similar arguments defeat them. With the
prevalence of Stoned and Michelangelo, the master/partition record is even more
important than the boot sector. For MS-DOS machines, FixMBR allows capture, and
F-PBR from the 1.xx versions of F-PROT allows examination, of the relevant
sector. (FixMBR, by the way, should be a part of any BIOS DOS, and all users
should be part of a massive letter writing campaign to Microsoft and Digital
Research, demanding to know why the twits haven't licensed it yet.)
<A NAME="A06"></A><A NAME="A07"></A>
<H3>Description of memory map at startup
<BR>Description of interrupts at startup</H3>
These two can really be handled together, both in concept and in execution.
Again, while the novice user can't be expected to know what all the numbers
mean, anyone of sound mind can see whether or not they change. The one problem
here is that, during the normal running of programs, some of these numbers do
change. Therefore, it should be stressed that, if any change is noted, it
should be checked again after a "reboot" of the system. At this point some of
the benefit is lost, as the novice user may not be able to differentiate
between a valid program which is sloppy in its use of memory, and a viral
infection. Having this item on the checklist, however, will give the
experienced support person an immediate baseline.
<A NAME="A08"></A>
<H3>Backup "originals" of software</H3>
As we progress through the list, it will be noted that a number of the
measures proposed are no more than those proposed for good computer management
and support without regard to viral programs. This should not be surprising.
The operations of viral programs are not different in kind from normal computer
operations. (This is why it is impossible to identify a viral, as opposed to a
valid, program by examination of the code alone.) Therefore, any operation of a
viral program could just as easily be done by the proverbial "ingenious idiot"
who has historically been far more deadly than any kind of malware.
<P>
As will be noted in future columns, I recommend that all software be
installed from "backup originals". These disks, or copies made after
installation, should there be any customization involved, should be kept with
the computer. This serves two purposes. It allows for quick access to "known
clean" software for re-installation, if necessary. (These "originals" may
reduce or eliminate the need for "full" backups of the system, as the software
is often the larger portion of material on the user's disk, and generally the
most stable.) It also provides a "baseline" for a quick check for any changes
to the software.
<A NAME="A09"></A>
<H3>Backup of hard disk directory structure</H3>
Backups are a part of good procedure (and are a part of this checklist, further
on, as well). However, while provisions are more often made for the programs
and data to be backed up, the directory structure itself is often forgotten.
Rebuilding the directory structure may, in fact, be the most time consuming
part of a recovery.
<P>
Keeping a copy of the directory may help in other ways. Some malware, the "AIDS
Information" trojan being a notable example, build extra directories in order
to escape detection. Having a baseline copy of the valid directories gives one
another means of detecting viral programs, rather than another place for them
to hide.
<A NAME="A10"></A>
<H3>Clean, protected bootable system diskette</H3>
<I>Do it now!</I>
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="B00"></A>
<H2>For each office</H2>
"Each computer" is pretty easy to define. An office is less so.
<P>
For the purposes of this checklist, an office is defined as a group of people
who interact on a regular basis. "Regular", for this purpose, need be no more
than once per week.
<P>
An office is, therefore, defined less in terms of locale and walls than in
terms of communication. For this definition an office may consist more of those working on a common project in far-flung cities
than of those in the next cubicle whom we never speak to. However, it need not
follow "official" reporting lines either. An office is defined more in terms of
how fast you can find information when you need it. The items in this next
section of the checklist are those which may not be referred to for long
periods of time while things are going well, but which may need to be found
quickly once an anomaly has been identified.
<A NAME="B01"></A>
<H3>Description of current common viri</H3>
This may be a prepared list, or it may be maintained in the office. For all
systems, the major prepared list must be the Virus Catalog prepared by
CARO/EICAR. This list is not complete, but it does cover all platforms and the
most widely distributed viri.
<P>
In the MS-DOS world, another possible source is the shareware summary list
collated by Patricia Hoffman. While this list is more complete in covering the
1200 (1300? 1500? by the time you read this, who knows?) MS-DOS viri, it is, of
necessity, less accurate at times.
<P>
Antiviral software, especially that which incorporates scanning, often
includes listings of viri, their symptoms and features. Some of these are good,
some less so.
<P>
All of these lists must be kept up to date, and it is probably an idea to
have someone within the organization who is supporting the prepared lists with
additional information from sources such as VIRUS-L.
<A NAME="B02"></A>
<H3>List of local virus information contacts</H3>
Who ya gonna call?
<P>
This is a very difficult section to advise on. For my part, I can think of
perhaps twenty people in the world of whom I could state, with confidence, that
they were competent in the field. This is not to say that there are not more,
but it is an esoteric field, with few standards to judge by.
<P>
The information is hard to come by, for one thing. The popular, and even the
technology trade media, has very little appreciation for the difficulties and
traps of virus hunting. The recent experience with Michelangelo points this out
sharply. Almost all the articles in advance of the March 6 date stressed that
the virus could be defeated by making backups or resetting the date. None
mentioned that a BSI could corrupt non-standard disk formats used by many
backup programs, and none pointed out the difference between the "DOS" date and
the "system" or "clock" date.
<P>
Virus "experts", in common with most system level hackers, tend to be
charter members of "Egos-R-Us". This is bad enough. However, what is worse is
that everyone with an outdated copy of SCAN thinks he or she is a virus expert,
and assumes the arrogance without necessarily having the expertise to back it
up. (Given that the general population, even of advanced computer users, has
very little background in the subject, the problem of proving credentials is
often moot.)
<P>
So, how can you find a local expert? Some indications:
<P>

</UL>
<A NAME="B03"></A>
<H3>List of all hardware and software purchased, supplier and serial number</H3>
As I mentioned before, this is one of the items that should be a part of any
office computer "kit" simply on the basis of good management. The reason for
its inclusion on the virus fighting side is partly in an attempt to track where
a virus came from. (Again, as I have mentioned before, originals should be
protected, copied, and the "copies" protected before installation.) More and
more companies are becoming aware of the need for software auditing, and this
may become very helpful here. (It is less helpful in those companies which take
a "righteously indignant" stance against shareware.) The hardware list is also
valuable, as certain pieces of hardware will affect the operation of the
computer, particularly in regard to memory utilization.
<A NAME="B04"></A>
<H3>Designated machine for receiving/ testing new disks/software</H3>
Now <B>this</B> recommendation I <B>know</B> is going to stir up a storm. It
always does. Why spend good money on a machine that is going to be used for
nothing except testing software?
<P>
This appears to be based in the deeply rooted prejudice which says that the
only important part of a computer system is the part you can see, feel and
throw through windows at times of stress. Let's look at the picture in real
financial terms. If you buy two copies of a commercial antiviral program (for
an "office" of, say, twenty computers), plus the "upgrade fees" for a year,
you've spent about $400. $300 will get you a bare bones PC for testing, and,
in addition to antiviral testing you can also detect trojans, which relatively
few antiviral programs do. (An AT level machine should only be $500, even low
end Macs can now be had for about $1500.) A designated machine also allows you
"pro-active" rather than reactive protection.
<P>
Besides, very likely you already have a computer that no one in the office
will use because of its age and "obsolescence". However, a word of warning is
in order here: we have seen cases, most recently with Michelangelo, where older
machines will not detect the full range of functions of the viral program.
There are also a number of viri which are "version specific" in terms of the
operating system; but it is relatively easy to set up a situation which allows
for quick changing of the operating system.
<P>
One point I also stress in regard to testing is to make sure that the hard
disk is not empty. There are some "prima donna" viri which refuse to operate
unless it is "worth their while" in terms of the amount of file space used.
Keep the drive about 80 percent full.
<A NAME="B05"></A>
<H3>Log of disks/programs received</H3>
Many large companies think they already have this. Many smal companies see
this measure as far too draconian. As usual, the truth lies somewhere in
between.
<P>
Corporations, both large and small, and government departments, often have
policies restricting the use of software. Usually these schemes make some
statement regarding bringing disks and software into the office. These policies
are, of course, universally disregarded, even by those who drafted them. Such
procedures are unnecessarily restrictive, unworkable, and fail to address the
issues that prompted them in the first place.
<P>
The intent is good. The institution wishes to protect the copyright of
authors and other companies (or at least wishes to avoid being sued for failing
to do so). The policy is also supposed to prevent the intrusion of viral and
trojan software into the company, and, in some cases, the extraction of
sensitive data from company files.
<P>
Unfortunately, I have yet to see such a policy which actually does so. In
most cases, the procedures are both insufficient to the intended outcome, and
damaging to normal business practice. I will use some examples from the
government of Canada. (Anyone gloating over the foolishness of this institution
does not know the policies within their own company.)
<P>
The Treasury Board is the governing body in financial matters, and therefore
publishes directives covering pretty much all aspects of federal government
practice. Several years ago, it published a circular stating that all computer
related software or hardware had to have an associated purchase order before it
entered government premises. At first glance, this would appear to be sound,
and even an advantage for software companies. Not so. If you are reviewing
software, a local government office cannot afford to purchase the necessary
variety of software and still keep within its budget. Of course, it <B>is</B>
possible to cut a P.O. for the software for no money. This takes about as long
as the review process itself, as well as potentially putting the software
company at risk (there being other policies regarding minimum and maximum
pricing). Even if you intend to purchase the software next fiscal year, you
cannot review it in this fiscal year if you have no funding left for that line
item, or cannot afford to "lose" that funding this year.
<P>
Federal government policy also provides for tracking of all inventory through
accession numbers. The system works well for desks and cars, but not so well
for computers and software. (I had a hard time convincing the "materiel [sic]
management" people in one office that it did not make sense to issue one
accession number to twelve video cards, but it did make sense to issue one
number to one card, three disks of setup software and one manual -- for the
same card.) Because of the difficulty in putting items into inventory (obtain
the inventory coding for the item, obtain an accession number, affix a label --
you ever try to find space for a 2cm by 6cm label on a video card? -- and enter
up to 46 fields of data into the inventory data base - by paper form, since
only two people in the local office have access to the data base itself) very
few software related items were ever entered into inventory. Data disks were
never labelled: after all, what do you do with a carton of 100 blank disks,
which are probably headed for thirty different offices?
<P>
In order to effectively track infections, however, even data diskettes and
customer data diskettes have to be identifiable. The system for doing so must
be easy, must not interfere with normal work, and must be <B>rigorously
enforced</B> -- <B>by the users</B>.
<P>
The trouble with most policies of this type is that these considerations are
not "designed in" from the beginning. Trying to make transitory computer
materials fit an inventory system designed for permanent fixtures, or
forbidding the entry of disks into the company, simply means that people will
ignore the policies in favour of greater productivity. The specifics of
recording and tracking will have to vary with the corporate climate and
culture. If an intent, and some relevant background, is presented to employees
(rather than a mandated procedure), the users will come up with a solution ...
and one that is far more effective than those imposed by head office.
<A NAME="B06"></A>
<H3>Memory and disk mapping utilities</H3>
In an earlier column I mentioned the need for memory and disk lists for each
computer. These areas do not need to be checked constantly, in most situations,
so there is no need for a copy of these utilities with each computer. The
utilities should, however, be available quickly and easily, should anything
prompt a check. Checks should also be done on a regular basis, and these tools
can be used on each computer in turn.
<P>
Having said that, many of the utilities needed are already a part of the
operating system. In the MS-DOS world, CHKDSK, while it will not show you a
graphical map of the disk, will provide information on the number of bad
sectors or hidden files. With MS-DOS 5, the MEM program provides needed
information regarding memory and interrupt usage. The Mac world, and the GUI
OSes in general, tend to provide less of these tools, but I believe that
ResEdit is now part of the Mac OS.
<P>
In any case, these utilities are widely available both commercially and as
shareware. Commercial utility packages often do "double duty": PCTOOLS probably
is sold most often for its backup capability, but can provide helpful
information for other areas as well. Shareware tools sometimes lack the
interface of the commercial tools, and more often are dedicated to a single
task, but frequently have useful features not found in their commercial
counterparts. (Neither PCTOOLS nor Norton have the ease of access to specific
sectors that the shareware SHOWFAT has.)
<P>
I would also like, at this point, to bring up a related issue. I have been
receiving feedback, from many sources, all tending to the same theme: "why not
just scan the computer and have done with it." It has, perhaps, escaped the
attention of these readers that at no point in this checklist have I required
the purchase of any specific antiviral software. This is deliberate for three
reasons. First, this checklist is intended as a conceptual guide and is, as far
as possible, intended for the non-specialist user of any system. Second, it is
intended to show that virus protection is possible without specialized software
(although antiviral software can ease the burden tremendously.) Third, the most
important aspect of virus protection is that the user know the system. That
cannot happen if the user is relying on some "magic bullet": there never will
be a magic bullet that will give 100% protection.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="C00"></A>
<H2>Regularly</H2>
As with "what is an office" so here, "what is regularly?" This is going to
depend on your situation, but, in general, it is going to mean "more often than
you do now." The items under this section of the list are particularly those that should be going on regularly for
good maintenance and support anyway.
<A NAME="C01"></A>
<H3>Back up data</H3>
Our good old friend, the backup. Why stress the data? Three reasons. First,
programs and structure should be backup up at installation and at every change
in configuration. They need not be backed up between times. Second, backing up
data only reduces backup time and increases the frequency with which people are
wiling to do a backup. Third, you can buy another copy of Perfect Writer
tomorrow. Can you buy another copy of your last months receivables?
<A NAME="C02"></A>
<H3>Monitor disk space, map, memory map</H3>
Especially if you partition programs from data, checking the free space can
give you a quick indication of many problems. On a disk map, check for
increasing numbers of bad sectors showing up, or programs which insist on
moving to the end of the disk. Again, the memory map should primarily be
checked at boot time. You need not understand what all the numbers and
interrupts mean, but if they change you might have a serious problem.
<A NAME="C03"></A>
<H3>Monitor program file sizes</H3>
If programs are partitioned from data (and data should here include any
configuration files which change frequently), disk space should give a quick
check for prepending or appending file infecting viri. A listing of the files
themselves would indicate specific infections. Generally speaking, a check of
the sizes of program files takes less time than might be realized at first.
Modern commercial programs take up a lot of space, but the number of individual
files is not excessive. (Except for those of us who have to have all the very
latest in freeware utils ... :-)
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="D00"></A>
<H2>At software install/change</H2>
This area should not require any definition. I should, however, mention one
thing in regard to "change". There are, unfortunately, still a number of
programs which modify their own code when a change is made in the
configuration. I am not including these minor amendments in this section's
definition of "change". When changes have been made which affect the size or
composition of a program file, the program should be backed up (either by
itself or as part of a full "system" backup) and the printout list of program
file sizes should be redone. The following items, however, are recommended more
in the case of installation of new software or a major upgrade.
<A NAME="D01"></A>
<H3>Protect original</H3>
I have mentioned before that I feel commercial software vendors are negligent,
in the face of an obvious and present danger, in continuing to ship software on
disks which are not only writable, but not even protected. Always protect the
original disk immediately you remove it from the package. Following this
procedure will ensure that you know whether the new software infected your
machine, or the machine infected the software.
<A NAME="D02"></A>
<H3>Install from protected backup</H3>
With the original disk protected, make a backup copy. Then, protect the backup
copy, and perform the installation from the protected backup. You are allowed
to make an archival backup, and this procedure allows you to store the
"original" original offsite, and the "backup" original new the computer, in
case of the need for disaster recovery.
<P>
Unfortunately, software manufacturers still insist on various types of copy
protection schemes. Recently, the most popular have involved writing changes to
the program based on a "registration" of your name and company -- on the
original disk. The practice of using a "backup" original will allow you, in
this case, to keep the manufacturer's software disk protected. However, there
are still some schemes that require reading from and writing to the
manufacturer's disk. Whenever possible this practice should be avoided.
<P>
As in a previous column, I am sure that some will object that it is far
easier to simply scan the disks for viri and "have done with it". I do, in
fact, recommend scanning all disks. Note that both original and "backup"
original should be scanned <B>after they have been protected</B>. Also to my
previous reasons regarding not stressing the use of scanners, may I add the
fact that scanners, by their nature, will never be able to protect you against
all viri, although they should protect you against most.
<A NAME="D03"></A>
<H3>Trial run on isolated system</H3>
Once again, this should be a part of general practice, regardless of the
existence of viral programs. A trial run allows you to find any bugs in the
program, and to review its usefulness. Recently, a trojan version of SCAN was
uploaded to a local bulletin board. It created all kinds of havoc because it
was "approved" by the board -- on the basis, of course, of having passed a
virus scan. A single run on an isolated system would have detected the problem.
<P>
There will be, of course, complaints that this measure is too expensive for
the normal office. However, one might compare the cost of a commercial virus
detection program (or even, say, a full set of the VIRUSCAN suite) against the
cost of a "vanilla" XT clone: about $300 or less. The test machine need not be
sophisticated, although there will undoubtedly eventually be viral programs
which will require a higher level processor to run. The majority, however, of
"successful" viri will target the widest possible set of platforms, and will
therefore work as well, or better, on low end machines. One should also
consider that the majority of "mutated strains" will be put together very
crudely by "teenage mutant basement hackers", and that these will undoubtedly
be put together on cheaper machines.
<P>
One caveat: we have seen a number of instances of malicious programs which will
not trigger until the hard disk is "filled" to a certain level. Keep the test
machine loaded, not with a minimal set of files, but about 80% full.
<A NAME="D04"></A>
<H3>Map memory before and after run</H3>
With the mapping of memory for all machines it was not important to understand
any of the entries. When testing new software, this understanding becomes more
vital. However, the one significant part of this test is quite simple: has
anything new been left behind, active, in memory.
<A NAME="D05"></A>
<H3>Offer "bait" files and disks</H3>
Some antiviral programs are starting to do this to "trap" viri. However, I am
more concerned, here, with the variety of "bait" to be offered. As with the
level of disk usage, remember that some viral programs will only infect certain
types of files, others will only infect files of a certain size, and yet others
look for specific internal characteristics (such as long strings of NUL
characters.) Offer a number of different files which you know the sizes of, and
can quickly check.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="E00"></A>
<H2>If infection found</H2>
Once you find an infection, what do you do about it?
<P>
First thing is, don't panic. Remember that a lot of viral programs don't do
any damage -- at least not intentionally. While you should not go blithely on
as if nothing had happened when you find a virus, don't overreact, either. And,
instead of focussing on the immediately obvious problem of the infection
itself, try to take a few steps for future protection.
<A NAME="E01"></A>
<H3>Send copy to recognized researcher</H3>
This step is vitally important, and all too often neglected. Get a copy of the
virus. Copy an infected program to a disk, or infect a floppy disk with a boot
sector infector. The instant reaction is to sweep it under the rug: that helps
no one. On the one hand, people are afraid of the reputation of viri as being
related to pirate software. However, if no one ever tries to find out how they
spread, how can we make the studies to determine this? On the other, new
variants spring up all the time, and we need to track and trace these
mutations.
<A NAME="E02"></A>
<H3>Isolate machine and disks</H3>
As mentioned, do not simply carry on as before. The floppy disks used in the
machine are often neglected in the panic. Remember that the most successful of
viral programs have always been boot sector viri, and these are always spread
by diskettes.
<A NAME="E03"></A>
<H3>Perform minimal disinfection</H3>
Please let me stress the "minimal". Do the <B>least</B> that you can do, and
still ensure security. While there is some doubt as to the wisdom of
"disinfecting" of program files, it is surely better to delete one file than to
restore the whole directory. It is better to delete and restore one directory
than to restore the whole disk.

However, do perform a thorough disinfection. Many people, while going far
too far in gouging an infection out of their workstation, will fail to check
out their floppy diskettes and backups. One of the most Frequently Asked

Easy answer. You didn't check your disks.

If you have a virus in memory, none of your disinfection methods can be
guaranteed, and some may even harm.
<P>
Once again, note that this checklist does not require any specific antiviral
software. Antivirals will be dealt with in due course.
