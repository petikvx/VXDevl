<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">1. Introduction</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are so many tricks which worms, and viruses
use in order to penetrate and activate themselves on the victim's computer.
While antivirus programs are very important, and usually, if they are always
kept updated, they can defend from the more common viruses, this is not
enough. Sometimes viruses spread so fast, that they might reach your computer
before the antivirus programs are able to identify them. It is thus not
recommended to count solely on the antivirus programs to provide the proper
defense, and to defend your computer from viruses by not activating them
on your computer. A virus can do its deeds only if it is activated (executed).
This might happen because you doubleclicked an attachment, or because it
used some security hole in your e-mail program to activate itself automatically.
In order to prevent a virus from activating itself automatically, you need
to apply security updates, security patches, or to configure your programs
so that risky features will be disabled. Yet, many viruses will try to
convince you to execute them by using various tricks, including many psychological
tricks. In this article, we try to raise your awareness to this issue by
providing representive examples, and explaining them, so that you will
be more cautious to identify suspicious files and thus not to activate
them.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">The most common channel of infection is e-mail.
It could be an innocent looking message, sometimes from someone you know
- might be your boss or a good friend. Could be someone you truly trust.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">In many cases, the content of the message looks
unsuspicious. You may or may not be requested politely to open an attachment.
Not something suspicious, only a word document or a picture, or a text
attachment, nothing that a typical user will suspect as being a virus.
Viruses, in many cases, are sending themselves from infected computers,
usually under the e-mail address of the owner of that computer, to e-mail
addresses that the virus finds either in the addressbook on that computer,
or in cached web pages, or in anywhere in the computer. Sometimes, under
another forged e-mail address that the virus found in the infected computer.</font>
<br>
<font color="#000000">This way, a virus use an infected computer to
spread further into other computers and infect them as well.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">We believe that a few examples, will clarify the
various tricks.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Since all the examples below are of famous viruses,
those viruses are already detected and removed by all updated antivirus
programs. Yet, their methods will clarify to you how it is possible to
trick you, and new viruses might try to trick you in similar ways, and
yet, not be identified by your antivirus program. We shall first discuss
those few examples of ways in which viruses succeed in penetrating into
your computer and activating themselves, and then, in the last section,
we shall make some more generic recommendations.</font>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">2. What is the meaning of infection</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, are executable
codes. Namely, they contain instructions for the computer to do unwelcomed
or malicious things. The code of a worm or a virus also has instructions
as to how to send copies of it to other computers. This way, viruses and
worms are spread: they simply instruct the infected computer to send copies
of them to other computers - either directly or indirectly. Trojan horses,
on the other hand, do not have the ability to self-replicate. We will not
enter here further into the differences between worms, viruses, and Trojan
horses, but will just comment that the exact distinction between viruses
and worms, is not within a consensus, and throughout this article, we shall
use the term "virus" as a generic term referring to either a virus or a
worm.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Of course, the code is meaningless if the computer
does not act according to it. Look, for example, at the following line:</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000">DEL c:\Windows\System\*.dll</font></font>
</p>
<p>If typed in an MSDOS window and you press &lt;enter&gt;, or if is written
in a batch file (a file with an extension .bat) that will be executed,
it will delete many crucial files from your operating system directory,
and will thus force you to reinstall your operating system. Certainly a
harmful act. But if this line is written as a part of a web page (just
as I did in this page) it is harmless, because your computer does not treat
those lines here, as instructions for it to follow, but just as lines that
should be shown as part of a web page.
</p>
<p>It is not the lines themselves that are harmful then, but rather the
lines of code, plus the environment which tells the computer to follow
the instructions within, which is the harmful thing.
<br>
There is a semantical question as to whether the lines themselves being
on your computer should be considered as an infection, or only if they
are in the right environment to instruct the computer what to do. In any
case, this is only a semantical question. What should be clear though,
is that a virus code, is harmless, if it is located in an environment which
will not cause the computer to follow the instructions within.
</p>
<p>So a virus code, once is able to instruct an infected computer, will
try to spread itself by telling the infected computer to send replicas
of it, to new computers, but it must send copies of itself, in a special
format, that will cause the new computers to activate the replicas (follow
the instructions within), either directly, by using a security hole in
the remote computers, or indirectly, by convincing the user of the remote
computer, to innocently tell the computer to follow the instructions within
that code. Once it is activated in the new computer, the code will instruct
this computer to spread it further in a similar way to more computers.
<br>
Most viruses will prefer to remain active also after the user shuts
down or restarts the computer, so they use one of various techniques to
tell the computer to execute their code once it restarts.
<br>
The virus may also include some payload, namely, besides spreading
itself, it may include instructions to do some other harm to the computer.
Sometimes only in very specific dates or situations.
<br>
We will now learn this issue further, by using various examples.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">3. Example: The "Loveletter"
worm - e-mail infection</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You get an e-mail message from a friend from work. The subject is "ILOVEYOU".
<br>

"interesting" - you think to yourself. You look at the message and
there is a message inviting you to look at an attachment with the filename:
loveletter-for-you.txt . You become curious and open it. The icon was not
the typical one for Notepad messages, but seems like something that represents
text, and you haven't pay attention to it.&nbsp; Nothing seems to happen
when you opened the attachment, but in fact, at this stage, you are already
infected by the Loveletter virus, and within a short time your computer
starts to send messages in your name to all addresses in your addressbook,
and, yes, the subject of those messages is "ILOVEYOU". This is just a message
similar to what you got.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>

The full name of the attached file on that message was:
loveletter-for-you.txt.vbs . The
VBS filename extension is for Visual Basic Script, and once you doubleclick
a file with this attachment it is normally opened by the Microsoft Virtual
Scripting Host, which will execute the code within. Former versions of
Microsoft Outlook and of Outlook Express, and also some other e-mail programs,
under the default configuration of Windows, will not show the extension
of a file. The existence of the ".TXT" extension, had to alert you but
didn't (sorry! my choice of the script). The icon of that attachment, is
not the same as a typical text file which is opened by Notepad, but the
icon looks innocent, and symbolize something of a text nature. E-mail is
not the only way this virus is spread, see the next example.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">4. Example: The "Loveletter"
worm - IRC infection</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You use mIRC to chat in IRC. This is a very popular chatting set of
networks. You enter an IRC channel (a chat room). Then you get from one
of the permanent participants in this chatroom a private message named:
<br>
love-letter-for-you.htm , i.e. a web page. You become curious and open
it, Internet Explorer loads to open this HTML message, and Internet Explorer
says something about the need to enable ActiveX to open this page. "The
heck" - you think to yourself - "if Internet Explorer tells me that it
needs something to open the file, why should I argue". You confirm IE to
enable ActiveX. Yet, nothing seems to be in that file, so you continue
to use IRC. What you don't know, is that when you opened the HTML page
and allowed IE to use ActiveX, you became infected with the Loveletter
virus, and yes, a short time later, your computer starts to send under
your name those "loveletter" e-mail messages to all people in your addressbook,
and when you use IRC, it will also send that WWW page to other members
of that IRC channels when they enter the chat.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
HTML pages, may contain embedded objects, and try to automatically
open them when they are opened. Internet Explorer has a very complicated
architecture which defines what is secured and can automatically be opened,
and what should not. ActiveX content is usually executable, but Microsoft
has a way to decide whether it can trust it to be decent or not. Under
default configuration of Internet settings (Internet Explorer), if an HTML
message asks for your permission to open an ActiveX object, you should
be suspicious. In this case, this was the virus spreading itself, under
the name of another member of the IRC channel, because his computer was
infected.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">5. Example: The "Sircam" virus</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You get an e-mail message from your boss. In this message he requests
for your advice regarding some document which is attached as a Word document.
You are accustomed to exchanging MS-Word documents with your boss and colleagues
at work, so there is nothing suspicious in it. In your case, you already
set Windows to show you the filename extensions of known filetypes, so
that you expect to see the right filename extension in that attachment,
and the document has the name: "A response to Wigner's suggestions.doc"
which seems quite reasonable, because Wigner corp. are big customers in
your company. You open the word document, and it is opened in MS-Word,
and looks really innocent. You just don't understand what was the advise
your boss wanted from you, as this document is a letter that was already
sent to Wigner 6 months ago.
<br>
Of course, this attachment was infected with the Sircam virus, and
once you opened it, besides showing you the original word document, it
also started to take Word and Excel files from computer, to add to them
the virus code, and to post them to addresses that it finds in your computer,
with a request for advice.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The real filename of the attachment that you got, was not DOC, but
rather something like .pif or .lnk (might be other similar types). So that,
for example, in the case mentioned above, the virus on your boss computer,
arbitrarily chose some file "A response to Wigner's suggestions.doc" and
appended this document to its code in a file with the name "a response
to Wigner's suggestions.doc.pif". When you opened that attachment, the
virus first activated itself, and then launched the original Word document
to MS-Word, so that it will look as if the attachment was really that Word
document. The interesting thing about these filename extensions, is that
they are not showed, even if you configured your operating system to show
filename extensions also for known filetypes.
<br>
These extensions are set by default to override that configuration.
In another document, <i><font face="Courier New,Courier">security and filename
extensions</font></i> [1], I enter much deeper into this topic than in
this document, where I just give (at the end of this article) advices how
to suspect that a file is a virus.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">6. Example: The "Concept" virus</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You got a Word document from your boss or from a colleague, doesn't
matter. You got it via e-mail or in a floppy disk, doesn't matter either.
They gave it to you. They did gave you this file, so it was not the virus
who sent it to you. Yet, since their computer was infected by a macro virus,
the virus infected all Word documents, in their PC. They weren't aware
of that. But once you opened the document on your computer, the viral code
has been activated, and&nbsp; infected all other Word documents on your
computer. If you send one of those by e-mail or via a diskette or put it
in some electronic library, and other will read it on their own computer,
they'll become infected too. When you read the document you weren't worry
much about macro viruses, because you instructed MS-Word not to run unsafe
macros. The concept virus used a security hole that allowed the viral macros
to override MS-Word's security settings, and to thus activate itself.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The document here is indeed a Word document. Just that it contains
Word macros, and those macro commands can execute arbitrary commands. As
we said, there is a security setting in MS-Word to ignore (not run) those
macro commands, but this setting had a security hole, and if you didn't
update your office tools with the relevant security updates, you could
get infected. The Concept virus, attack only Word6, and Word 7 and Mac
word documents, but similar security holes existed in newer versions of
Microsoft Office as well. There are security fixes for them, and if you
use Office updated as suggested above, then your MS-Word application will
ignore those macros and will thus not activate the virus. Similar macros
exists also for other Office files, such as Excel spreadsheets. In this
example we discussed a legitimate document, which was infected. You cannot
simply discard it. You should, however, read it in a safe environment,
namely, with MS-Office updated with the latest security updates, and only
after you scanned it with an antivirus program. Antivirus programs, may
be able to remove viruses from files while restoring the files to their
uninfected state.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">7. Example: The "SubSeven" Trojan</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script #1:</font></i>
<br>
You are browsing a newsgroup dedicated to posting of some movies, one
of the movies is not viewable, and some people complain, and in return
someone posts a viewer which he claims is able to view also this movie.
<br>
You try to install it, but for some reason it seems that the installation
didn't succeed. What you installed, was in fact a Subseven Trojan, which
opens a backdoor on your computer to allow others to get full access to
your computer.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script #2:</font></i>
<br>
You are looking for a cracked version of a program (an illegal version
of a program) on Kazaa. by searching for a program with that name, and
indeed it is offered in a few places. You take one of them and try to install
on your computer. What you are not aware, is that this was not that program,
but rather the Subseven Trojan.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script #3:</font></i>
<br>
You are using IRC, and someone you are familiar with on that IRC channel
- a known helper, is offering a nice program, that is related to a discussion
held there. Since you trust this person, you download and install the application,
which does not work. What you don't know what you installed was the Subseven
Trojan, and that the "person" that posted it, was not the one who usually
use that nickname, but rather someone who forged his name to that name
of the person you trusted.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script #4:</font></i>
<br>
You are reading a forum on the Web. One of the more reliable people
on that forum sends an executable file to that forum. He uses the name
player.jpg for that file, but instruct people to rename it to player.exe
before running it (the forum does not allow sending executables). You need
the application he was speaking about, and you are thus running it. You
didn't take into account the fact, that in this specific forum system,
it is very easy for someone to disguise himself as someone else, and that
in this specific case, the person who posted this Trojan, forged his nickname,
and described this Trojan program as if it does something different.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script #5:</font></i>
<br>
You are looking for some defense program, and you look at a web site,
that allow readers to contribute their own programs to it. You find something
that according to the description fits your needs, and try to run it at
your own computer. nothing seems to happen, but in fact, you are not aware
that you have just installed a Subseven Trojan on your computer, and that
this Trojan opens a secret backdoor for others to get free access to your
computer, without your consent.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The common in all those examples, is that the poster of the file or
the person who put it in the place where you took it from could be anonymous,
or could easily forged his identity. This allowed that person to put a
malicious program, and to present it as a useful one. Trojan horses are
not capable of spreading themselves automatically. But they can still be
put by people, if those people can remain anonymous (e.g. by giving false
identification). The Subseven Trojan is just an example of such a malicious
program, although a very common one. There are other similar programs,
that can be posted under any executable name, and can do their deeds secretly.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">8. Example: The "Nimda" worm
- e-mail first type of infection</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You get some e-mail message from someone that you know, and open it
using your Outlook Express, or Microsoft Outlook (but you didn't patch
them with the latest security fixes). The body of the message seems empty
and you don't see any attachment. What you are not aware, is that once
you opened the message, a virus embedded in a hidden attachment exploited
a security hole in your mail program and Internet Explorer in order to
activate itself on your computer.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">Discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The Nimda virus, is a very sophisticated virus which uses various tricks
to spread itself. It uses a security hole in Outlook Express, Microsoft
Outlook and Internet Explorer, in order to activate itself automatically
upon opening the message. If the trick works, the attachment will not be
visible.
<br>
This security hole is one of a few security holes that allow automatic
activation of content in Outlook or Outlook Express. Another virus which
is called KAK, uses a different security hole to do a similar thing. All
of those security holes have patches which should be installed. In all
cases, it is enough that the infected message will be opened in the Preview
Pane of Outlook or Outlook Express in order for the virus to activate itself.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">9. Example: The "Nimda" worm
- e-mail second type of infection</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You get a message from someone that you know and you open it with your
e-mail program. This time you may use any of various e-mail programs including
Outlook and Outlook Express that are fully fixed with the latest security
fixes. Inside that message you find a file with an icon of HTML message
(Internet Explorer), and which is called "Readme". Certainly looks like
an HTML message. You open it, and this activates the Nimda virus.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">Discussion:</font></i>
<br>
This time your e-mail did not open the attachment automatically. The
real name of the attachment was "Readme.exe" but your e-mail program is
configured to hide filename extensions for known filetypes. A file of type
.exe can set its icon to an icon that it holds internally, and this virus
tricks users to think that it is a legitimate HTML message.
</p>
<p>HTML messages and the way many e-mail programs and web browsers deal
with them, are a source for security holes. New security holes are found
from time to time, and new security patch to fix them are released later.
Usually viruses which use security holes in the way HTML (and HTML extensions)
are handled, became common after security fixes were released. There is
no guaranty that this will remain true.
</p>
<p>Anyway, in this case, it is not an HTML message, but rather an executable
code which holds the virus.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">10. Example: The "Nimda" worm
- infection while browsing</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You visit a web site that you trust with the use of Internet Explorer
version 5.00 with the latest security fixes. You are not aware that while
visiting it, you got infected with the Nimda virus.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
Version 5.00 of Internet Explorer is no longer updated with fixes to
security holes. You need to upgrade it to version 5.01 and above. A security
hole that allows a web site to automatically execute a code on your computer
regardless of your security settings, exists there. In this case, the person
who updates the web pages on the remote site, got infected with the Nimda
virus. Then he worked on some HTML web page, and after finishing it, he
loaded the web page to the remote site not knowing that the worm has infected
the web page, by adding itself as an embedded code to that web page.
<br>
When you browse the web page, with a version of Internet Explorer which
is not fixed with the security patch relevant for this security hole, it
will execute the internally embedded viral code on your computer.
<br>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">11. Example: The "Opaserv" worm</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You have just bought a new laptop, and wished to be able to connect
it to your Desktop computer. You connect them, and in order to allow the
moving of files from one computer to another, you enable file and print
sharing on both computers. A few days later you find out that there is
a high volume communication going through your desktop computer although
you have no idea what is it. You run an online antivirus program and clean
it, but shortly later you find that it again infected your computer. You
didn't use e-mail during that time.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
What you were not aware when you enabled file and print sharing, is
that you enabled it not only to/from your laptop computer but also sharing
them with the rest of the Internet. Your computer is opened wide for anyone
with a bit of knowledge.
<br>
The importance to limit or disable "file and print sharing" over the
Internet, is very high. The Bymer is another worm that uses this. The Nimda,
among other means of infections also uses this way to spread.
<br>
It is also common among intruders to take control or to access the
victim's computer by first putting a backdoor program in the victim's computer
with the use of such a sharing.
<br>

</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
Kazaa is a popular file sharing program which is popular for sharing
(mainly illegal) music and program files between different computer which
are connected to its network.
<br>
You use Kazaa to locate some program, and find it on some remote computer.
You download and install the program but it seems not to work. You are
then try to locate a different place for this program, but at the same
time you notice that your hard disk becomes rather fulll, and that the
folder which is used for sharing files to others starts to grow with more
and more files that you have never put there.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The "Benjamin" worm, on infected computers, fills the sharing folders
with many copies of itself. Many of them have attractive names, and just
like you got infected with it by taking it from a remote computer because
you thought that it is what its name suggests, also other people will download
it from your Kazaa shared folder, thinking that these are the programs
that they wish to install.

<br>
The infection methods of the Klez.h worm are similar to the e-mail
infection methods of the Nimda worm, and for this reason, I skipped the
"script" part here. The main difference, is that the Klez.h worm spread
from infected computers, to addresses that it finds there, under forged
e-mail addresses that it also finds there. This means that you might get
an infected e-mail that seems to be coming from someone that you either
know or don't know, but in fact, it came from someone else.

<br>
You take a diskette which contains files in an executable file format
(any file format which on your environment, might execute commands). You
use the diskette on a friend's computer and then go back and use it on
your own computer. You don't have to execute anything in the other computer,
but you weren't used the write-protect tab on that diskette. While you
put the diskette on the remote (infected) computer, and, say, copied something
from it, the virus has infected the files on your diskette. When you are
back to your computer, and open one of those files, even though you believe
that they are the same ones that you put on it on your own computer before
you used it on other's computers, those files are already infected, and
will infect your computer. The moral here, is that it is important to slide
the write-protect tab on the diskettes (so that it will have two opened
windows in it), before putting it into a computer which you cannot fully
trust for being cleaned. Unless of course you need to copy things to that
diskette. Of course, if you copy something to that diskette, even if the
copied files are of no executable format, you can trust the files on the
diskette, only as much as you can trust the remote computer to be cleaned
from viruses.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">15. Example: boot sector infections</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script and discussion:</font></i>
<br>
Such viruses are no longer common, but I still wish you to be aware
of the method that they use.
<br>
Each diskette (and also most of the other medias) has besides files,
also what is called "boot record" or "boot sectore" (the term "boot sector"
is the one used in the case of floppy diskettes). Not only files in the
diskette can be executed, but also the boot sector can as well. The boot
sector commands will be executed only if the computer tries to boot from
the floppy diskette. This means that once your diskette has "visited" a
non-trusty computer (i.e. a computer which you cannot fully trust to be
free from viruses) if you by mistake left in in your floppy drive, and
booted, and your PC is configured to first try to boot from the floppy,
you might become infected even if the diskette is not bootable, and has
no files in it.
<br>
Our recommendation here, are that if it is possible, to configure your
BIOS so that your PC will boot only from C:\, and to change this setting
only if needed and for the task needed. If the BIOS is configured to first
boot from the floppy, and you need to leave it unchanged, then at least
don't forget the floppy inside it. As in the former case, when using your
diskette on other's computer, write-protect the diskette unless needed
otherwise.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">16. Example: the truncation trick
(e.g. shoho)</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">script:</font></i>
<br>
You use a recent version of Outlook Express, and it does show the filename
extensions for all filetypes.
<br>
You receive a message with the following attachment "readme.txt". You
know that this version of your e-mail program, shows you all filetypes.
You try to open the attachment, and become infected with the Shoho virus.
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New,Courier">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
If the filename was "readme.txt" then there was no problem. Yet, the
trick was to use a name which begins with, say:
<br>
readme.txt but after the .txt there are many blank characters followed
by, say ".scr".
<br>
something like:
<br>
"readme.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.scr"
<br>
but with more blanks in between the false extension (.txt) and the
true one (.scr). Many programs including recent version of Microsoft Outlook
and Outlook Express, and various other kinds of programs (not only e-mail),
will truncate lines longer than some size, and in this way you will not
see the true filename extension but only part of it.
<br>
An easy trick to know whether the filename continue beyond its visible
part, is by starting to mark it for copying (copying the name). If the
line will be marked also after the visible part it means that there are
blanks after the visible part of the name. If the text marking will refuse
to go beyond the apparent filename, it means that the text really ends
there.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">20. Example: The CIH virus</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">discussion:</font></i>
<br>
The CIH virus is also known as the Chernobyl virus.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
reason for mentioning it here, is not the way it infects your computer,
but rather to let you know of things that a virus can do. For quite some
time, the virus is only busy with spreading. On certain dates, it may activate
its payload. Basically it will try to delete part of your hard drives.
This by itself can cause you quite a problem, and if you cannot recover
that part, the worst thing is that you lost some information, and have
to reinstall everything. I'm not underestimating this damage, but there
are many destructive viruses, and this is not new. The other thing that
it tries to do, is to erase the BIOS. Before we exaplain what is the BIOS
and how should we tackle that, let me tell you that once it erased the
BIOS, in many cases, we cannot even reinstall the operating system, and
even many computer labs cannot fix it, but only send it to bigger labs
or replace hardware parts.
</p>
<p>The BIOS is in fact the first program that the computer executes. It
does not lie in the hard disk, because when the computer executes it, it
still cannot even recognize the hard disk. In fact, one of the tasks of
this program is to help the computer recognize the various parts, such
as display card, memory, CD-ROM drive, and hard disks. Only after running
this program, the computer is able to run the operating system from the
hard disk or to access the CD-ROM or floppy. In the past, this was a fixed
program which was installed as part of the motherboard. Later, in order
to allow the upgrade of the BIOS to newer so that it is possible to add
new features, and support of newer hardware, companies started to build
their motherboard (the component of the computer which connects all the
other parts of the computer and help them to "talk" with each other), so
that it is possible to change the BIOS program. This puts our computer
also at a risk that programs can delete the BIOS. If this happens, then
even the first step of the boot will fail. Many modern computers have the
ability to write-protect the EPROM (the component in the motherboard which
holds the BIOS program) so that it is impossible to rewrite the BIOS or
erase it iwithout first removing the write-protection. The instructions
may vary from one motherboard to another.&nbsp; Some motherboards have
dual-bios, which contains besides the rewriteable BIOS also another BIOS
which is more nbasic but fixed, and which allows you to reinstall the other
BIOS in case it was erased or corrupted.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><font size="+1">21. Overall discussion</font></font></b>
</p>
<p>In this article we showed some examples of viruses that use security
holes to activate themselves automatically, while in other examples we
saw how viruses try to cheat us to activate them on our computer. Once
a virus is active, it may instruct the computer to load it every time the
computer restarts. They may instruct the computer to spread them further,
and they may even contain some malicious and harmful payload which will
be activated at a specific day, or when a specific condition is met.
<br>
Applying security fixes, or upgrading the relevant programs to versions
without a security hole, is very important. When it comes to Microsoft,
applying the patches can be easily done by using the Windows Update feature,
and applying the "critical updates" mentioned there. The exploitation of
security holes in Microsoft's products is very popular among modern viruses.
<br>
Another subject which is not discussed here is the configuration of
the software so that risky features are disabled.
<br>
Using an updated antivirus program is important, because we cannot
trust ourselves to know all the tricks, and to fix all security holes.
</p>
<p>Of no less importance is our own knowledge and awareness about the possible
tricks that viruses use.
<br>
As we saw, the fact that an e-mail message came from someone we trust
is not enough for us to trust its content. It might be that a virus posted
itself under this person's name, and it might also be that that person
did post the file, but without being aware that the file contained a virus.
Being suspicious is always important.
<br>
Of course, we cannot recommend people not to accept attachments via
e-mail or software from the web, because, this might prevent you from using
many legitimate services, but being suspicious is still important.
<br>
If you are not sure that this is a genuine attachment/file sent by
its claimed poster, you should ask. Even if you know that you should expect
to receive such a file from someone, it is still wise to first save it
in a file and then scan it with an updated antivirus program before opening
it. While a virus must be executable, and if the attachment/message is
not in an executable format, it can safely be opened, it is important to
understand the various tricks used by viruses/Trojans to hide their executable
nature. I would recommend to read my document "Security and Filename Extensions"
on <a href="http://www.geocities.com/uzipaz/eng/safe.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/uzipaz/eng/safe.html</a>
.
<br>
You should be aware hw each file will be opened and about the way your
application treat different files.
</p>
<p>You should know that unless you know that a filename of some properties
will be opened by a program in a safe environment, that will not allow
it to run harmful commands, you should treat it with enough suspiciousness.
Files with filenames such as .jpg, .tiff, .txt, etc. are likely to be opened
by programs which will not be able to execute any viral code if exists
in them. If you need to use one of them, and you believe it to be safe,
still check it with your antivirus program(s).
</p>
<p>Although in this article we do not wish to give detailed recommendations
on how to secure your PC against viruses and Trojans, we shall still provide
some recommendations:
</p>
<p>1) If you have Internet Explorer version 5.0 please update it first
to version 5.01, or 5.5 or 6.0 and then upgrade to the latest service pack
and only then update with the latest security patches. All of those upgrades
can be done via "Windows Update".
<br>
2) If you have Outlook Express version 6 or above, you may, from the
Tools/Options/Security tab, set it to warn you whenever an application
tries to use Outlook Express in order to post a message under your name.
This might be useful in any case you became infected with a virus which
uses Outlook Express to spread itself via e-mail.
<br>
3) If you use Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express, it is recommended
to consider setting it to run HTML in the "Restricted sites" security zone.
