<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;	By Brandon Wiley</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The Warhol worm design began the theoretical discussion of so-called
"superworms", a new type of computer worms. A worm is a computer
program which copies itself from computer to computer in an attempt to
reproduce as much as possible. A superworm uses more advanced
techniques to achieve very quick infection of the network. The primary
strategy behind the Warhol superworm is to pre-scan the network for
vulnerable targets. When the worm is launched it already has a large
list of targets with a known method for infection and can therefore
quickly infect an initial seed population.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
One thing which the Warhol paper mentions is that better results might
be achieved via a coordinated worm in which various instances of the
worm on different computers communicate with each other in order to
optimize infection. The Warhol paper states, however, that no
coordinated worm has ever been created. This paper proposes the first
design for a worm which utilizes efficient communication between worm
instances for an optimal infection strategy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The purpose of adding coordination to a worm design is to raise the
level of sophistication in the attack from a simplistic greedy strategy
to a more game theoretically optimal cooperative divide and conquer
strategy. There are times when a greedy strategy can be suboptimal.
Overly zealous propagation can lead to early detection and eradication.
Also, it is simply wasteful for a worm instance to attempt to infect a
system which has already been infected rather than choosing an
uninfected host as a target. Unfortunately, typical worms have no
information on which to base a more sophisticated attack. In order to
divide the infection tasks among operative worms, the worms must know
about each other and have a method for dividing work among themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The difficulty in creating a coordinated worm is in minimizing the
coordination costs among worms. Since the initial goal of a worm is
generally to reach all hosts on the Internet, the number of eventual
worm instances will be enormous. The coordination strategy must be able
to scale reasonably to that number of instances. If every worm had to
coordinate with every other worm, for instance, the amount of bandwidth
used to communicate between the worms could easily exceed that used by
a greedy worm, defeating the benefits of coordination. The coordination
strategy must also be simple to encode since worm designers attempt to
make worms as small as possible.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Efficient Coordination of Worms</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
Interestingly, the problem of efficiently organizing worm instances
into a network which can act globally but which has reasonable
coordination costs for each node is very similar to problems found in
peer-to-peer networks. The particular task of the division of the task
space among all of the currently active worms is very similar to the
problem addressed in distributed hash tables (DHT)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
designs. One popular contemporary DHT design is called Chord. In Chord,
each node is assigned a portion of the task space such that the space
is divided evenly and randomly among all nodes. Chord has some useful
properties. First, each node in the network is reachable from each
other node in the network with a maximum of O(log N)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
intervening nodes. Additionally, each node only needs to maintain
knowledge of O(log N) other nodes, thus keeping coordination costs down
to a reasonable level. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">What this means in simple terms is that in a network of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">one million nodes each node only has to keep track of approximately 20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">other nodes</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> and for one node to send a message to anothe</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">r node </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">in the most distant part of the network</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> it would take a</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">t most 20 i</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">ntervening nodes. Similarly, for a network of ten million </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">nodes, each node has to keep track of approximately 23 other nodes</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">and it will take at most 23 intervening nodes to reach from one side of the network to the other. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">There are </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">advanced
variants of the Chord architecture which layer additional properties on
top of the guarantees provided by the basic Chord design. Anonymous
Chord (Achord) adds the property that it is very difficult for any node
to find out the identities of all of the other nodes in the network.
This makes it more difficult for an attacker to disable the network by
discovering the identities of nodes.&nbsp; By having worms form an
Achord network, a global framework for division of the space to be
attacked can be created with reasonable coordination costs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Details of Coordinating Worm Attacks with Achord</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
In order to create an Achord network, each node needs to be assigned a
unique, difficult to forge, difficult to generate identifier.
Identifiers are assumed to be generally random and evenly distributed.
Each task also needs such an identifier. Tasks are matched to the node
whose identifier is the closest match. The method which Curious Yellow
uses to assign identifiers to worms and targets is via the SHA1 hash</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
of their IP address. It is relatively difficult to choose your own IP
address and the SHA1 hash makes the identifier approximately random and
evenly distributed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The method for nominating a worm to attack a target is easy. Each
Achord node knows the IP addresses of the two nodes whose identifiers
are closest to its own. When it learns of a new target, it calculates
the identifier for the target and then determines if it is closer to
the worm's own identifier or one of its neighbors. If the worm is the
closest to the target then it attacks the target. Otherwise, it informs
the closer neighbor of the existence of the target and then forgets
about it. Since the identifier space is globally consistent, decisions
about which worm should attack will always be consistent. Additionally,
the decision about who should attack does not require immediate
communication between the worms. Communication is only necessary to
inform nodes of found vulnerable nodes which they are responsible for
attacking.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The initial deployment of the worm network using superworm pre-scanning
techniques may take up to 15 minutes (Warhol) or merely 30 seconds
(Flash).&nbsp; Once the initial seed network is deployed, it can be
used as a platform for launching a second stage of activities. One
obvious activity is distributed scanning of the network for
vulnerabilities and further infection. Unlike Code Red, which used a
greedy scanning strategy, Curious Yellow will have exactly one worm
scanning each potential target. This will both reduce the load on the
network and make detection less of a threat. The global connectedness
of the entire worm network allows for an even more interesting type of
distributed scanning than is at first apparent. Since all nodes are
reachable from all other nodes, it is possible for the worm's creator
to release code patches to all of the worms in the network and for
these code patches to spread to the entire network even faster than the
initial infection (less than 15 seconds). Therefore, as new exploits
are found for previously invulnerable systems, they can be distributed
to the worm network, which has already been building up a list of
potential future targets. The Warhol method of pre-scanning attacks can
thus be utilized repeatedly for rapid infection of diverse systems. The
speed at which patches can be distributed to worms is so great that it
will probably out-pace attempts to fix vulnerabilities. A zero-day
exploit</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
can be used by worms for infection before news of the vulnerability has
even been made public. Code patches can also be made to change the
behavior of the worm to mask signature behavior which could lead to its
detection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The second stage of infection allows the infection to progress from
controlling a large portion of the network to controlling the
overwhelming majority of the network. This is just another part of the
infection stage. Once the majority of the network has been infected,
Curious Yellow can lay dormant until part or all of it is activated for
some purpose.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
There are a number of possible purposes to which Curious Yellow could
be used. One obvious use is to simply crash the majority of the
Internet at once.&nbsp; Once it is activated, the worm network has
achieved its purpose. A slightly more interesting use of the worm
network would be to use it for distributed denial of service attacks
against enemy hosts. The typical approach for this is to have all
compromised hosts send a flood of packets</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
to the target, thus overloading it sufficiently to keep any legitimate
packets from getting through. However, this is a naive approach when
given such an advanced network to work with. The Curious Yellow
infection should, if properly deployed, control the vast majority of
the network. All of the infected nodes can act in concert towards a
common goal. Nodes and groups of nodes can be specialized for certain
tasks. New directives can be sent to the entire network in less than 15
seconds. It is therefore not necessary to have the entire network gang
up on a single machine in order to disable it. This is in fact a greedy
rather than cooperative strategy and thus suboptimal. First of all, the
target to be attacked is probably infected. Therefore, the worm
controlling the target can simply be instructed to disable the target.
Additionally, if all of the nodes surrounding the target simply drop
traffic routed to the target then the target becomes unreachable.
Finally, the worms controlling the hosts attempting to contact the
target can simply ensure that no attempt to communicate to the server
is ever made. Curious Yellow, acting globally and in unison, can make
any host simply cease to exist as far as the network is concerned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
Having total control of all of the Internet's traffic allows for other,
more interesting, attacks. Traffic can be modified arbitrarily as it
passes through the network. Defacing a website no longer requires
actually having access to the computer containing the website. Web
pages can be defaced automatically as they pass through the network,
resulting in the world's collective web browsers rendering the pages
differently than they are stored on the servers, a problem that the
server administrators are totally powerless to fix. All of the
unencrypted traffic on the Internet can also be observed. The entity
controlling Curious Yellow can pick out particular individuals to
monitor or gather statistical information about a large number of
individuals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
Of course, Curious Yellow's control over individual computers is not
limited to controlling Internet traffic. As zero-day root exploits are
found and patches distributed, worms can eventually gain superuser
access to all of the machines, giving them access to all of the stored
information and all of the spare resources such as hard drive space and
CPU cycles, and the ability to surveil all of the world's
Internet-connected computer users. By sending out code updates to the
network which cause Curious Yellow to metamorphasize into an
anonymizing proxy network, its owners can connect anonymously to target
computers and control them interactively, browsing files and watching
what users do with them. They could also program the worms to
automatically send back potentially interesting information. The spare
resources of the world's computers could be utilized for whatever
agenda the owners of Curious Yellow have in mind. In general the uses
of the network are endless. The entity which controls Curious Yellow
controls the world's computers.</span></p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
Dealing with the infection once it has been detected is difficult. Once
a signature has been detected for the worm, it must be codified by the
various competing virus scanner manufacturers and then distributed to
infected computers, probably by voluntary downloads. Naturally, once an
anti-virus patch for the worm becomes publicly available on the
Internet, Curious Yellow will cause that site to disappear from the
Internet. Inoculation will therefore have to happen by hand using
physical media or network distribution which is secretive enough that
that owners of Curious Yellow (subscribers to many major anti-virus
update programs) don't find out about it. Once the patch falls into the
hands of the creators, Curious Yellow will soon receive a counter-patch
obsoleting the old anti-virus patch. Unfortunately, anti-virus
distribution methods cannot keep up with the pace of Curious Yellow
patch distribution. The only method which can eradicate the virus,
therefore, is to disconnect the computers from the network and then
apply via physical media patches which both eradicate the virus and
patch the vulnerabilities which allowed it to spread. Once the virus is
totally eradicated, the creators will wait for a new zero-day exploit
to be discovered and then relaunch the virus with a new transmission
vector and signature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The only way to protect against Curious Yellow is to inoculate every
computer with an anti-worm, Curious Blue, which uses similar technology
to instantly distribute security patches. As soon as an exploit is
discovered, a security patch must be released to Curious Blue before an
exploit patch can be released to Curious Yellow. Infection and
protection is thus primarily a race between the owners of the two
entities. Of course, there might not be only two entities. There could
be any number of competing vendors of Curious Blue offering different
patches and different quality of service guarantees. Similarly, anyone
with access to zero-day exploits could launch their own Curious Yellow.
The battle does not end there, however. Curious Blue could act as an
ideal platform for the initial stage of a Curious Yellow infection. All
that is needed is an exploit in the Curious Blue code. Once one is
found, the entire Curious Blue network can be turned, like a clever
move in a game of Othello . The same is of course true of turning
Curious Yellow into Curious Blue. These programs are particularly prone
to such corruption because they are already designed to accept
arbitrary code upgrades. They merely need to be fooled into accepting
code which is not actually authorized.</span></p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The authorization of code updates is a crucial component to both
Curious Yellow and Curious Blue.&nbsp; Without a strong authentication
system, the worm network can easily be taken over by an arbitrary
attacker. The obvious way to do authentication is with public key
signatures</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">.
In order to use public key signatures, the entity deploying the worm
creates a pair of keys, one public and one private. The public key is
distributed with the worm. The private key is known only to the worm's
creator. When the creator wants to send a new code update, it generates
a signature from the code using the private key. Since the worms have
the public key, they can check to see if the signature was in fact
generated by the matching private key. Using this technique, no
attacker can send code updates to the network unless he possesses the
creator's private key or finds a vulnerability in the worm which allows
circumvention of the signature check.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
Maintaining the secrecy of the private key is an interesting problem in
a world overrun by competing strains of Curious Yellow and Curious
Blue. A simple strategy which an attacker controlling one worm network
might use to compromise another is to instruct the network to search
all computers for files that might potentially contain the private key
of the competing network. Due to the large size of private keys, they
cannot be easily remembered and so much be stored electronically
somewhere. In order to keep the private key from being discovered, the
creator will be forced to have a special computer used for generating
signatures which is never connected to the network. Signatures will be
generated on this computer and then transferred to a network-attached
computer via removable media. The attack then is to find where in the
network signatures are first introduced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
The worm network can be configured to search for signature files stored
on removable media. The network can also monitor other coexisting worm
networks to see when code updates are sent. When a received code update
matches a signature file found on removable media, the creator of the
worm has been detected. Naturally, the creator of a particular strain
of Curious Yellow would prefer that his own computers were not infected
with competing strains. Unfortunately, the only way to ensure this is
to inoculate with a strain of Curious Blue, which will undoubtedly also
be searching for the creator so as to have legal action taken against
it. Assuming, however, that the creator has the resources to inoculate
against all competing strains, it can still be tracked. As the code
updates propagate through the network, competing strains can monitor
the progress. Using statistical analysis of the propagation of code
updates, the source of updates can eventually be traced. Once the
location of the creator has been determined, physical coercion such as
spying, threats, lawsuits, and arrest are possible to gain control of
the private key and thus the worm network.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">
In order to avoid being traced, further cryptography is necessary. So
that the progress of code updates through the network cannot be
monitored, the worm code needs to be encrypted so that it cannot be
easily examined to determine which code it currently is running. It is
still possible to examine the contents in memory, but this will be a
somewhat difficult task to encode in a program the size of a typical
worm. Additionally, code updates being sent over the network must be
encrypted so that their progress cannot be observed. Even with
encrypted connections, however, the creator can still be traced through
timing correlations. All the the observer needs to see is that one worm
contacted another, then that worm contacted a few others, leading into
a cascade. Whichever worm made the first contact is the one closest to
the creator. Defeating timing correlation requires the worm network to
be constantly sending cover traffic to other worms. Luckily, code
updates are generally small, so the amount of cover traffic to be
generated is not very much. Once the network is communicating entirely
over encrypted channels with constant cover traffic, the creator can
send out code updates in an anonymous, untraceable manner. Not only
that, but the creator can also use the network to render anonymous any
other transactions, such as using it as an anonymous communications
channel to converse with other entities and distribute files and
information. This would be a boon to the usual cast of characters that
could benefit from anonymous communication, such as people attempting
to escape human-rights-violating regimes, international terrorists, and
music fans.</span></p>

In the world after the global infection of the Internet by strains of
Curious Yellow and the commercial availability of strains of Curious
Blue, computer users will have a choice. One can either have a computer
which is never connected to the Internet, risk almost certain infection
and control by the various factions controlling Curious Yellow, or
intentionally give control to the creators of Curious Blue. There are
multiple issues of trust involved. Initially there is the question of
whether one places more trust in the harmlessness of the hackers or the
professional integrity of the security professionals. If one chooses
Curious Blue then there is the issue of which strain will actually be
effective in protecting one from infections by Curious Yellow. There is
the additional issue of which strain can be trusted to not contain any
vulnerabilities which can be exploited to turn it to the other side.</span></p>

Kazaa feature, Altnet. Kazaa is a peer-to-peer file sharing network not
entirely unlike Achord, but lacking some of the useful features. In
later versions of the software Kazaa bundled a feature called Altnet,
which is a second peer-to-peer network deployed alongside Kazaa nodes.
when Kazaa is installed, Altnet is quietly installed as well. Buried in
the licensing agreement which users click through when installing Kazaa
are some interesting provisions concerning Altnet. The user agrees that
Altnet is allowed to automatically receive and install code updates and
modify settings on the user's computer. This makes Altnet a prime
target to be corrupted and used as a widely deployed network from which
to launch activities. All that is needed is the proper method for
causing the supposedly 2.5 million Kazaa nodes to accept a rogue code
update. Interestingly, such an attack has already occurred. While Kazaa
is the predominate licensee of the FastTrack network technology, it was
previously second to an application called Morpheus, another
application using the FastTrack network. Morpheus was mysteriously shut
out from the FastTrack network despite the fact that it was supposedly
an entirely decentralized network without a central form of control.
The network of Morpheus clients was shut down by a rogue code update,
eventually discovered to have been sent by the company behind Kazaa.
This is the first example of the sort of warfare between strains. It
could escalate into being literally a war between worm strains if an
entity discovers the key to making Kazaa accept code updates and
mobilizes the Kazaa network as a first stage of infection, using it for
decentralized scanning of the network for vulnerable hosts and an
eventual global takeover of the Internet.</span></p>
