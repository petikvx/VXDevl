presentation should be considered an introduction to the virus writing
phenomenon. It will focus on understanding how virus writers operate, how they
perceive their world and the world around them, and how they think. In addition,
we will present several case studies. While avoiding the often dangerous over
generalization into some homogenous group, an examination of various motivations
and technical abilities will be presented; trends in the virus writing
communities will be explored, and future threats will be considered and possible
solutions presented. <o:p>

Many people assume virus writers and hackers are similar, and thus approach the
problem with similar methods. However, the virus problem has developed in
parallel but different routes than hacking problem. These differences are both
technical and cultural. <a href="http://www.av.ibm.com/ScientificPapers/Gordon/Crime.html">“Technologically
Enabled Crime: “Shifting Paradigms for the Year 2000” </a>can provide the
reader with significant insights into some of the subtle, but important,
technical and cultural differences, and provide insight into ways in which these
two cultures are beginning to merge. The Generic Virus Writer, and The Generic
Virus Writer II can lead the reader into a fuller understanding of virus writers
themselves. These research publications are available online at:<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">There
are six questions that I am often asked. The first is<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>“when will you update your research on virus writers?”
The answer is “all of the time”. Several years of research produced <a href="http://www.av.ibm.com/InsideTheLab/Bookshelf/ScientificPapers/Gordon/GenericVirusWriter.html">The
Generic Virus <span style="mso-bookmark:_Hlt449170846">W</span>riter </a><a name="_Hlt449170846"></a><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>study, the results of which were presented at the Virus
Bulletin<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Conference (<a href="http://www.virusbtn.com/">http://www.virusbtn.com</a>
) in 1994. This initial qualitative research provided many valuable insights
into the cognitive development of some of the world’s most prolific virus
writers - at that time. These insights allowed me to show that virus writers
were <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">not, </b>despite what some were claiming, a homogenous group.
Understanding their differences and leaving the stereotypes behind, the research
began play a role in helping others to understand this pressing problem - and
begin developing some strategies for combating the problem. It enabled us to
realise that they, and perhaps others like them, could be expected to ‘age
out’ of virus writing. This was good to know; there were not that many virus
writers at that time and any leaving that particular proclivity behind would
have a significantly positive effect on the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The second
question I am often asked is really two-fold:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>“what exactly is ‘aging out’”, and “how can
‘normal’ kids do things which most adults view as anti-social?” The idea
behind aging out is relatively simple, and is well accepted in other areas of
research into anti-social behaviours [1, 2, 3]. Let’s begin with one of the
theories of moral development [4]. It’s not the only one, but it is the one
chosen as an instrument for the original study. As a child begins to mature, his
moral/ethical development goes through a number of stages, with ages roughly
correlated to levels in these stages:<o:p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">That
is the short form of this particular theory. It is not without some weaknesses,
primarily it disregards significant cultural differences that determine what is
moral in non-western societies, resulting in a form of moral absolutism [5].
However, strengths of this particular instrument are well-documented [6]. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
The existence of a normal ethical developmental stage/age relationship does not
necessarily consistently moderate individual behaviour in any given situation
until an individual is older, and capable of integrating thought and action in a
more mature way. This brings us to the second part of the two-part question:
“How can otherwise ‘normal teenagers’ do irresponsible ‘wrong’ things
like ‘writing viruses’? “ <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
I’m sure most readers can think back to a time when they, or their children,
behaved in some reckless or anti-social way, perhaps as a teenager. Just as an
individual could know its “wrong” to stay out after curfew when his parents
have told him it is (a) illegal and (b) against the house rules, an individual
can know it is ‘wrong’ to write viruses - yet, still <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">do</i>
the ‘wrong’ thing. Usually, in people who are within ethical norms, the
anti-social behaviours tend to go away as they grow up. (Whether or not those
who commit the acts are labeled ‘delinquent’ often depends on whether they
are caught; it can also depend on race or socio-economic status.) When these
behaviours go away, it’s sometimes referred to as ‘aging out’ of the
behaviour. Sometimes the behaviours may recur from time to time; usually they
finally go away completely. That’s the short form of the ‘aging out’
theory.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
If it were really the case that the virus writers profiled<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>were ‘normal young people’ in terms of general development, as the
research suggested, we would expect them to ‘age out’ of virus writing.
Would they? I pressed on, past the usual hurdles in longitudinal study,
following up on the subjects over the next several years. (The only subject with
whom I was unable maintain contact was the adult employed virus writer &amp;
distributor.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To date, the original
ex-virus writer has remained an ex-virus writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The college student has aged out of virus writing. I would expect the
last to follow suite, but this remains to be seen. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Over the years, we have observed this ‘aging out’ has happened time and time
again, and it will probably continue to be one factor in lessening the number of
active virus writers. However,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>they
don’t all age out. Part of that follow-up study also discussed developing
trends, and predicted a future that was a bit darker. Okay, a lot darker. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">The Darker Venture<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Question
three? People ask me “how old are these guys”. I’ve talked with virus
writers who claim to have started in their pre-teen years, and given their level
of skill and familiarity with viruses, I see no reason to disbelieve them;
however, youth does does seem to be diminishing as a primary attribute. Whereas
in the early days, virus writing groups were generally populated by young men in
their mid-teens to early twenties, the mean age of the virus writers in one
currently active and well-known virus writing group is 23; the oldest member is
33 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ve talked with
virus writers who are in their forties. This is indicative of one disturbing new
trend documented in <a href="http://www.av.ibm.com/InsideTheLab/Bookshelf/ScientificPapers/Gordon/GVWII.html">The
Generic Virus Writer II</a>: involvement of people who are older and possibly
more ethically mature in general engaging in virus writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How can this be?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
As predicted, we began to see more and more of this type of involvement of older
people, and predicted this would continue and increase. This involvement seems
to take various shapes. Sometimes, the shape is not malicious, but rather
curious. For example, it is not uncommon for some adults involved in testing of
anti-virus software to alter a virus in an ill-conceived but well-meaning
attempt to see ‘how good virus detection is’. No matter how well
intentioned, this can lead to problems, which are documented in [7]. Similarly,
several Macro virus variants appear to owe their creation to experimentation at
the hands of ordinary users. This is sometimes carried out as part of a quest to
“understand” the virus; other times it is done with what appears to be no
good motive, as such viruses have been released into the wild seemingly
intentionally.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
It is not clear whether these trends are due to a change in people (which seems
unlikely), technology (possibly), or simply that experimenting with viruses in
general is seen as “less wrong” as we approach the final days of this
millenium. In general, when objectionable or questionable behaviours are
tolerated, even tacitly, they can take on a ‘legitimate’ tinge of
acceptibility [8]. Research is currently in progress to shed some light on this
issue. My guess is that it is a combination of the three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>

</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Data taken from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“The Generic Virus Writer II” seemed to indicate that there is indeed
a “New Age” virus writer beginning to take shape - older, more network-aware
and more technologically advanced than some of their predecessors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Wait. Did I say older and network aware? I did. The fourth question
people ask me is “what will be next in viruses”. Well, I hate to say I told
you so, but…<o:p>

payloads, but he likes simple 'annoying' and rather humorous payloads like this

Profiles of individual virus writers can be interesting and provide insights
which help us to understand the human facets of the problem - the first step
toward solving those particular problems. Such profiles are currently under
re-evaluation and development, and are scheduled for presentation <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/">at

Two of this article will discuss the final two questions that most often arise

Question 5, “How have they changed” will contrast the

virus writers of today. Question 6, “WHY do they do it” will hopefully
answer this (most frequently asked) question once and for all, before offering

<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">PART II - Is There Anything New Under the Sun?<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This
was supposed to be part two of a two-part article. However, as I began to
examine the issues about to be discussed, I was deluged with responses from
people who believed they had evidence of some “significant” changes in virus
writing - thus, I will put off my discussion of why virus writers write viruses
until Part III. This article will examine the question “How have they
changed?” If you’ve been counting, this is question number five. Let’s
begin with how things were.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
In October 1993, the number of virus writers who were actively contributing to
the problem of computer viruses found “In the Wild” comprised a relatively
small percentage of the global computing population. The number of their viruses
actually causing many problems was quite small too, especially considering the
number of viruses known to exist - the number of computer viruses which were
reported spreading In the Wild was 71<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(13),
with a total virus count of a ~3200 (14). During this time, there were virus
writers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>known and unknown; working
on their own, and working in groups like Phalcon/Skism, RABID, NuKe, Trident and
SLAM. They used handles like Dark Angel, Attitude Adjuster and Aristotle. They
wrote viruses, placing them on publicly accessible Bulletin Board Systems, FTP
sites, and WWW sites, and they kept viruses to themselves (15). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
some cases, they sent viruses only to AV researchers, because while they wanted
to show someone they could write a certain proof of concept virus, they really
didn’t want to release the virus to the general public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They wrote viruses that were not released in any way into cyberspace (for
lack of a better term), and never caused anyone any problem (other than
necessitating their inclusion in scanners “just in case”); they wrote
viruses that they did release into the cyberspace, causing all sorts of
problems. They made their source code available, and they kept their source code
“just for their private individual use” or “just for use within their own
group”. They dedicated their viruses to various people, they used some viruses
to promote their own groups or identities, and they left some viruses completely
anonymous. They attended secondary schools and universities, and they were
professionally employed (16). They were beginning to beta-test viruses (17).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
In May 1999, there are approximately 150 viruses found In the Wild (18), with
approximately ~30,000 known to exist. Some virus writers are pretty well known,
signing their creations, while some prefer to do their deeds in secret. Some
labor alone, while others work in groups like 29a, SLAM (all new, all revised,
and not related in any way to the original), The Codebreakers, and The NoMercy
Virus Team. They use names like DarkMan, VicodinES and Knowdeth. Some virus
writers put their viruses up for public consumption on FTP or WWW sites; some,
however, prefer to keep them for themselves. Some restrict their distribution to
within their own groups. In some cases, they bestow viruses only upon AV
researchers. Some virus writers today release their viruses to unsuspecting
users; others do not actively release the viruses. Some virus writers make
source code available, while others prefer to keep it to themselves. Some
viruses are dedicated to individuals or causes; other viruses are used to
self-promote. Some remain anonymously authored. Virus writers attend secondary
schools and universities. Some are professionally employed. Beta-testing of
viruses is pretty common. Sound pretty similar?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The truth is, in many ways, things are the same as they ever
were...<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">New Bottles, Old Wine?<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Some
people claim interesting “new” ideas have come out of the virus writing
community. Has the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“creativity”
of virus writers’ actually started to take on a whole new face? The answer, as
is so common when analyzing virus writers and their behaviours, is both yes and
no. One purportedly new idea is something called (in its current incarnation),
Project Zero. Project Zero was designed as an “experiment” which should show
what would happen if nobody in the vX community would release viruses to the
public anymore for an arbitrary time period of, for example, one year (19).
While this may seem noble - after all, no viruses is a good thing - one goal of
such a project could be to lull the antivirus developers and users into a false
sense of security. And, despite its emergence as a “novel idea”, the same
idea was tossed around by NuKE affiliates in the old days (20). It was just
about as successful, too. Be it vortex or vacuum, the idea is the same, just
dressed up in millenium garb. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Another “new” idea is that viruses are actually “evolutionary programs.”
In particular, several virus writers have recently mentioned to me (21) their
belief that replicating code could be used to explore various concepts of
artificial life. This is certainly true, but not a new idea; it was explored
long ago in (22, 23), to cite just two examples. Additionally, these types of
experiments in real artificial life concepts are worlds apart from “virus
writing” and should probably not really even be mentioned in the same breath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then there is the idea of viruses that could be good entities, also
frequently cited as a “new” idea - discussed several years ago in (24,25).
Padgett Peterson, well-known anti-virus and general security expert says it
best: “I have never seen a virus do anything that is not easier and more
reliable to do without a virus (except be a virus, of course)” (26). Well
said, Padgett! <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">But Wait, this is NEW! Really!<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">One
interesting and actually somewhat new idea which has come to light may show a
slight change in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">modus operandi </i>of
the virus writing community. In the early months of 1999, we saw alleged virus
writers and distributors attempting to sow confusion by going ‘public’ on
the Internet, registering such domains as <a href="http://www.datafellowes.com/">datafellowes.com</a>
and vgrep.com.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
The Codebreakers internet site, which abruptly vanished in the midst of the
Melissa investigation, was reincarnated as codebreakers.net on a site hosted by
a large web hosting company in Florida. The site was no amateur-looking
hodge-podge. It was particularly well done, with excellent graphics and a real
“research” feel to it. It was registered to someone claiming to represent<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“DataFellows, Ltd” (27). At this time, the site appears to have been
discontinued, for unspecified reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contact
information for the domain refers to an e-mail address located at a different
web hosting company in Cupertino, California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, according to the person we asked at DataFellows, located in
Finland, neither the site nor these contact details had anything to do with the
“real” DataFellows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">At the same
time, the WWW site www.datafellowes.com appeared on the Internet - also hosted
by the same web hosting company in Florida as the now-vanished codebreakers.net.
As if registering a domain which is an obvious misspelling of an existing and
well-known anti-virus software manufacturer was not enough, there have also been
reports of misleading E-mail associated with this domain - and even I was not
immune to this! Several weeks ago, I received an E-mail appearing to be from
Mikko Hyponnen, an anti-virus researcher working for DataFellows. The mail
requested quite a few viruses. As Mikko is a CARO member, such a request seemed
unlikely at best, and so I gave the message extra scrutiny. Closer inspection
showed that the message reply would have gone to datafellowes.com, not
datafellows.com, Hyponnen’s usual address. Several other prominent anti-virus
researchers also received similar requests; they, like me, also spotted the bait
and switch. Who exactly was the mystery mail sender, I don’t know - what was
clear was that had I complied with the request, I would have been sending
viruses to someone who was not the real Hyponnen. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Once
again, at the time of writing, the www.datafellowes.com site does not appear to
be operational. Neither the company which hosted the site, nor DataFellows, was
at liberty to discuss details of the incident; notwithstanding, the details
published here should prove sufficient warning to most. Things are not always as
they appear. Another example of this type of “mistaken” identity involves
VGREP, a popular utility produced by Sophos, which available at <a href="http://www.virusbtn.com/">www.virusbtn.com</a>;
the utility can be used to provide a quick and easy reference for virus names.
Imagine my surprise, and that of V-GREP creator Ian Whalley, when I spotted
Vgrep Anti-Virus Inc., using the e-mail address of vgrep@hotmail.com.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Is this somehow related to the Codebreakers and Datafellowes events? Only
time will tell.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Thus, it seems that the “bad guys” are indeed attempting to confuse the
issue by a troublesome (but not particularly creative) manipulation of
procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The question remains --
is this “new”? Setting up Bulletin Boards which appeared to be “legitimate
research facilities” was a favorite ploy of some early virus writers (28). In
the mid-1990s we saw the same sorts of attacks using e-mail when virus writers
pretended to be everyone from Dark Avenger to well-known antivirus researcher
Frans Veldman, and everything in-between. Confusion is the name of the game. So,
while the Internet provides some novel twists to the chase, the overall ploy is
unchanged: the “robbers” are pretending to be the “cops”. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">Something <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">New</i> under the Sun…<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">So,
with so many things remaining the same, has <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">anything</i></b> changed? Yes. The
operational characteristics and demographics of virus writers have undergone
some subtle shifts, which began several years ago (29). While geographic hot
zones do pop up from time to time, the advent of cheap connectivity for many has
resulted in more global alliances not centered around a particular BBS; the net,
as it were, in action. Where groups were once relatively regionalized (30),
groups that do exist seem more geographically diverse; for instance, The
Codebreakers group reportedly has 7 members from Europe (Austria and Germany), 3
from the United States and one from Australia. Where there are still some
strongly regionalized groups(31), these regionalizations appear to be based on
language limitations. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Some virus writers are much more willing to discuss issues than in the early
days. This may be due in some part to the general acceptability of
“counter-culture” ideas on the Internet<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
per se</i>, or the increased (supposed) anonymity afforded by various forms of
Internet communication (32).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
in addition to the anonymity afforded by some Internet media, there is more
willingness to debate publicly - at least on the part of some of the virus
writers and those who are in favor of public availability of viruses. As I
arrange a panel for the upcoming DEFCON Conference to discuss this very issue of
viruses on the Internet, I find no shortage of people who are willing to speak
publicly regarding their approval of such availability, in full view of their
opponents, press and peers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other
than that, though, the song remains pretty much the same.<o:p>

In Part Three, we will take a look at “why they do it”, examining
motivations and justifications in more detail. Understanding why they do it can
provide some insights which will help us take action that can slow down the
viral glut. <o:p>

a starting point, let us approach the topic from the viewpoint of the virus
writers. In their own words, how do they <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">justify</i>
their actions? Notably, the arguments outlined below have remained relatively
unchanged over the last several years. Such arguments were frequently
encountered upon some of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">FidoNet</i>

Programming computer viruses is not some super-elite arcane art-form. It does
not require some top-secret type of programming skills known only to the
cognoscenti. Virtually anyone with the interest can learn how to do it, and just
doing it does not make it “research”. Good research implies certain goals,
guidelines and appropriate scientific technique [35]; this is a world apart from
randomly injecting a small piece of self-replicating code into an unsuspecting,
unconsenting and uncontrolled computer-using population. It is just plain
irresponsible to experiment with viruses in such uncontrolled environments,
given the potential for viral interaction with the computers of human subjects.
This includes experimentation using your college or employer’s network without
their consent. No matter how you look at it, it is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">irresponsible.</i><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
It is also irresponsible to set self-replicating programs free where this
interaction is an inevitable consequence of that action. Some would argue that
placing viruses on the WWW is in fact setting them “free”, that placing
viruses on the Internet for other people to experiment with is irresponsible
because the program’s author cannot control what someone else does with the
viruses once they are made available [36,37]. This is a question with
philosophical and cultural colourings beyond the scope of this article, but
please think about it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
there is certainly a potentially expensive, destructive cycle that follows the
life of an ItW computer virus. There may be issues of negligence and liability
when it comes to making these types of programs available, with concern being
shown by more and more organizations as evidenced in these examples of
Membership Agreements and Disclaimers [38-41]. This is one possible reason why
many Internet Service Providers now have “acceptable use policies” which
prohibit the distribution of computer viruses [42-44].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They may not want to risk being involved in lawsuits related to
negligence. To any virus writer reading this article: if you <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">must</b>
experiment, keep your experiment it to yourself, or you might find yourself in
the middle of such legal action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

cleared up, let’s continue with some of the current justifications…<o:p>

didn’t throw trash on the ground at Disneyworld, the street cleaners would be
out of a job”. Yet, we surely do not look upon those that throw lit cigarettes
on the ground with admiration, do we? . The bottom line here is that while it is
true that if virus writers did not release viruses, the users would not need
antivirus software (allowing most virus researchers to shift into other, equally
interesting, areas of work), attempting to paint some lovely picture of healthy
symbiosis is simply not supported by the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">So
far, we have taken a brief overview of the justifications many virus writers use
for their hobby, and noted that most, if not all, of these reasons are far from
new. Similarly, several of the motivational factors for virus writing are also
unchanged.<o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Today, as yesterday, in some cases virus writers are motivated by simple
intellectual curiosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
understandable, especially considering the free availability of viruses and the
media attention given to viruses and virus writers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Virus writing continues to take place as a form of political expression;
Stoned_June4th (Beijing) and Macedonia being two examples. Viruses as an
expression of love and admiration for the opposite sex or for peers continue to
be keyed into existence. In the early days we saw viruses like Gergana,
Neuroquila and the MtE “demo virus”. More recently, we find “love”
expressed a bit more directly via viruses like Ivana, which proudly proclaims<o:p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Another
motivation behind virus creation is to designate “turf”. In the past,
viruses like NPOX and Vice planted the viral flag for NuKE; today, we have such
ignoble creations as WM97/Antimarc [46].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other cases, virus writing and distribution is positively correlated with being
told “thou shalt not. It is widely agreed upon by behavioral scientists that
the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“thou shalt not” approach
may not prove very effective in situations where direct and immediate
consequences cannot be observed [47]. Thus, despite much saber rattling on the
part of the anti-virus industry and law-makers, legislating away the virus
creation problem seems an unlikely solution. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Being “one of the boys” appears to continue in importance, too; the need for
peer approval is illustrated by gravitation toward “groups”, with group
affiliation providing a form of social identity [48]. While there have been
several cases of female virus writers documented over the past several years
[49-53], females do not appear to have made a significant contribution to the
population of those viruses in the wild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently,
while females play a minor role in the virus writing community as a whole, their
presence appears to be a moderating influence in the community. There appears to
be very little gender-related sexual bias within the community. Further research
into gender issues related to group involvement and technology, and virus
writing specifically, might provide some additional insights.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Finally, some virus writing has been the direct result of various forms of
provocation by anti-virus researchers themselves. This was more common during
the early days of the virus problem, when a (thankfully) small number of AV
researchers would insult the virus writers, calling them names [54-59] or claim
they were too stupid to create a virus that “did xyz” Shortly thereafter, we
would find a virus doing or attempting to do, “xyz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other cases, disparaging remarks were made regarding the young
person’s appearance, or physical characteristics. While there is simply no
point to this sort of “discussion” [60], this cycle does unfortunately
repeat itself from time to time today [61,62], though with lower frequency. Such
negative interactions continue to produce negative responses as well as negative
impacts on users and should be avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun:

debasement.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
There recently has been a trend toward adapting the “open source” mindset
for publication of viral code, and this has not been lost on the virus writing
community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is apparently done
in an effort to warn users of the dangers of certain design philosophies. To
quote one virus writer, <o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">It
should be noted that it is not virus writers alone who think there may be some
merit to the publication of viral source code. Some users report that
online-publication facilitates a wide understanding of exactly what viruses and
payloads do; some believe such publication is actually essential in keeping
corporate security people up to date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
not everyone shares this view. In particular, many in the antivirus community
believe such public dissemination of information is irresponsible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>David Chess of IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center has this to say
about the issue. “<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">The moderators should
never let such things through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike
bug exploits, where at least a case may be made that it's a valid last resort if
a vendor has been notified of a bug and </span>ignored it, <span style="color:black">viruses
don't go away when you just fix a bug” (63).<o:p>

</o:p>
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">It should be
further noted that the differences between open source and availability for
software in general, for security exploits and for computer viruses are
substantial. Beyond the scope of this article, the effect on the user when these
worldviews collide will be discussed in Vancouver at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">VB
99</i> in “When World’s Collide” [64].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For now, it should suffice to say that if virus writers are attempting to
influence <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Microsoft</i> or any other
corporation by showing real or alleged vulnerabilities in the product line, it
would seem a more responsible course of action would be to do so <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

viruses can have on human beings in terms of their work and personal lives, many
of which center around computers, it never occurred to me that creating and
releasing more and more viruses was an acceptable way to behave. Too much
depends upon the stability of computers for this sort of silly experimentation
and potentially dangerous game. Yet, for some virus writers, our societal
dependence on computers is <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">exactly</i></b>
the motivation for virus creation and distribution, and it’s not a game to
them. According to some virus writers, our society entrusts far too much
importance information to computerized technologies, to the point where there is
a moral responsibility to take a form of action which forces us to reconsider
this dependence. To them, the end justifies the means, and while this

you might ask, are we seeing the same old arguments, over and over? This is
mostly due to the replacement factor, a direct result of the aging out
phenomenon I described in part I of this series. This factor has a tremendous
effect on the overall virus writing subculture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By and large, the members of the virus writing community are in a
constant state of flux. As mature adults exit from one side of the population,
new, ethically normal but undeveloped adolescents enter at the other. In turn,
this continual flux provides a certain lack of development within the community.
Hence, each new batch of virus writers is essentially discovering these
arguments for themselves, leading to oft-repeated debates between the “white
hats” and the “black hats”. Finally, those members who remain in the
community are all somewhat ethically underdeveloped, further skewing the
population, and making the role models there decidedly less than perfect. <o:p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#333366">Conclusions<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Despite
the similarities, there are some differences in virus writing which are
unfortunately becoming more and more common. These were first noted in “The
Generic Virus Writer II”, presented at the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Virus
Bulletin Conference </i>in 1996, where I introduced the concept of the “New
Age Virus Writer”. This concept became a prime-time news headline with the
introduction of the Melissa virus into hundreds of thousands of networked
computers. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Today, more and more virus writers have an increased awareness of connectivity
issues that simply was not present in the early days. It should not surprising
that an increase in networked environments would lead to an increase in
opportunities for people to learn about networks. The sorts of innovations that
have come to exist in the past five years certainly add a new dimension to the
problem of viruses. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Payloads now have the capacity for compromising an entire network, and more than
a few virus writers are beginning to explore more general security issues.
Melissa was not a one-shot-deal; ExploreZip indicates very much the shape of
things to come. This trend will probably continue over the next several years,
and it is likely that there will be an increased cross-over between the security
and virus worlds. In light of this, response time to new viruses will become
paramount, as the presence of viruses on the corporate LAN may well become more
than the current nuisance it is now and a matter of considerable urgency.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
What has happened to the original groups that held all of these beliefs and had
these motivations? In some cases, individuals have simply repositioned
themselves, taking a “leadership” role. In most cases, however, the members
of old groups have grown up, realized that creating and releasing computer
viruses is not a good or admirable thing,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
moved on. Some have taken jobs in various computer-related industries; some have
found other professions more rewarding. In a few years, most of the current crop
(at least the ethically normal ones, which we would hope would be most of them)
will probably age out of this behavior and new ones will unfortunately take
their places. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
Those that continue writing and making viruses available to the general public
will be seen as “irresponsible” at best, and criminal at worst (depending on
one’s geographic location and what one does with the viruses once they are
written). That said, it is interesting to note that while some have argued for
stronger legal action, research into adolescent at-risk behavior finds that
youths are <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">not</b> significantly
motivated by fear of legal reprisal or involvement with the criminal justice
system. They are more likely to be influenced by peers, family and other
significant others whom they like and respect. Fear of the law does not appear
to be a major demotivator for many virus writers and it appears that for now,
the community continues to play itself out over and over again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Until we begin to tackle the root causes of virus writer motivation, this
will continue to be the case; a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>multi-disciplinary
approach is required to solve a multi-faceted problem. Anything less is
oversimplification.<o:p>
