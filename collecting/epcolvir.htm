<p>Why does someone collect small series of 1's and 0's, also known as files, 
  which are known to have the ability of completely ruining a otherwise perfectly 
  fine day? At least someone who collects stamps, Barbie dolls or other assorted 
  knick-knacks can show off his collection to anyone that is interested without 
  creating havoc in his albums or showcases. <br>
  What is the attraction of having thousands of these little files spread around 
  your hard disk with the ever present possibility of "double-clicking" 
  the, Oops Godd*mn, wrong file? For many virus collectors this underlying sense 
  of relatively "harmless" danger is a large part of the intense fascination 
  with these gremlins of the computer world, the computer viruses. Other factors 
  that can create this fascination with computer viruses are the inherent underground 
  image ("the forbidden fruit") and the pure technical features ("artificial 
  life") of these mostly tiny files. Underlying this fascination is the pure 
  human habit of collecting anything that can be collected.</p>
<p>With this generic little essay I am going to give you my views and philosophies 
  on the virus collecting and my personal experiences of collecting viruses for 
  the last 6 to 7 years. Since Vesselin Bontchev has written a very nice <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epvirlib.htm">essay 
  on collecting / researching computer viruses</a> I am not going cover every 
  possible detail but just give you my view on certain topics. Subjects I intend

  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="a"></a>1. My personal history of collecting computer 
    viruses</font></b></p>
  <p>As I have already mentioned in a couple of interviews my virus collection 
    started with one single virus. My personal attempts at mastering a computer 
    and the rise of the computer virus happened almost at the same time. Seeing 
    many 10 year olds around me using computer keyboards as if it was a part of 
    their body was pretty frustrating initially. I had always been interested 
    in anything technical or futuristic and the acceptance of the personal computer, 
    as an integral part of society was something I did not want to miss. </p>
  <p>My first computer was an Acorn Electron with a whopping 32K and a cassette 
    recorder as a storage device and it was on this machine that I attempted my 
    first QWERTY induced programs. BASIC was the language to go with and at the 
    time it looked pretty advanced to me. I had never even heard of other languages 
    like Cobol, Fortran or assembly and to be honest all the programming stuff 
    was way over my head at the time. </p>
  <p>Around the same time one computer in particular was becoming very popular, 
    the Commodore C-64. This computer could be equipped with a disk drive and 
    it was this computer that sparked the first rumors about a new phenomenon, 
    the computer virus. Initially this phenomenon did not really interest me too 
    much since my Acorn was not really susceptible to it. Also it was mostly associated 
    with illegal software and I did not have any illegal software, so for me the 
    problem was non existent.</p>
  <p>About a year later I had experienced a second hand Spectrum ZX that was OK 
    but through my employer I got the opportunity to buy a relatively cheap IBM 
    compatible PC. This "amazing" 8086 machine got me started in the 
    world of Microsoft, floppies and hard disks. In the mean time the available 
    software skyrocketed and I totally skipped trying to program myself. I heard 
    many more stories about the computer virus issue but the technical side did 
    not interest me too much. Although I thought it was probably a nuisance I 
    would never encounter I still decided to run AV software on my "new" 
    386.</p>
  <p>Then one day I borrowed a piece of software to try something new and just 
    for the hell of it I scanned the borrowed diskettes with the McAfee AV software. 
    To my amazement the scanner told me one of the diskettes was "INFECTED" 
    with the Cascade virus. Now, this really got my attention. Something I thought 
    that would never touch me had found me. This brush with a computer virus told 
    me I could no longer avoid the issue if I was to continue my computer hobby. 
  </p>
  <p>After many hours browsing BBS's (Bulletin Boards for those not familiar with 
    the pre-Internet period) in the area I collected a lot of information about 
    computer viruses, the problems they could cause and the best ways to defeat/combat 
    them. Reading all that material sparked my interest and I started looking 
    for more material. In my search for this material I ran across a BBS that 
    had about 20 viruses online in a limited access area. I wrote the sysop of 
    the BBS requesting access to that area and I sent him my single Cascade virus 
    as proof of my "expertise". I guess he was convinced because I promptly 
    got access to the virus area. This really started my virus collection because 
    these viruses again got me access to a bigger VX BBS with even more viruses.</p>
  <p>In the beginning I was sort of paranoid about computer viruses, I thought 
    they would infect everything by just copying them from disk to disk. I used 
    separate floppy disks marked with red marker to store them and I ran a virus 
    scanner just about every ten minutes. Something else I did not really appreciate 
    in the beginning was the existence of variants of a particular virus. I thought 
    that when I had one copy/variant of a particular virus I had enough for collecting 
    purposes. Boy, was I wrong! Nowadays variants account for most viruses necessary 
    to complete a virus collection.</p>
  <p>With my meager virus collection of about 200 viruses I departed for the US 
    early 1994. Soon I was back to visiting BBS's and within no time I found several 
    VX BBS's. My 200 viruses got me access to most of them and now my virus collection 
    was really growing fast. Names like Chiba City, Black Axis and Arrested Development 
    are nostalgia to me and some of the other early virus collectors that are 
    still around. Then all of a sudden the ultimate VX BBS popped up; the West 
    Coast Institute of Virus Research (WCIVR) operated by Falcon and Polt. The 
    number of viruses online was intimidating and caused many collectors to start 
    salivating in front of their monitors. Like so often with BBS's dependant 
    on outside contributions the users leeched more than they contributed, but 
    it was hard to contribute something to such a vast collection. After a while 
    WCIVR also made its appearance on the WWW which made leeching even easier. 
    Ultimately this caused Falcon to fall back on limited access through monetary 
    donation and in the end even that could not prevent the downfall of the greatest 
    VX collection site ever. <a name="err1"></a><i>[see <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/.note.html#falcon">errata</a> -- herm1t]</i></p>
  <p>When the number of viruses in a collection passes a certain limit any logical 
    structure tends to disappear and a form of organization is paramount. There 
    are many ways to organize a collection and I will get back to some of those 
    later on. When I determined I had to start organizing my collection in picked 
    what I thought was the easiest way, I used a popular virus scanner that was 
    known to ID in an organized manner. F-Prot, a well-known DOS-based freeware 
    virus scanner/remover is still the main utility I use to organize my collection 
    today. </p>
  <p>Separate from the scanner based organization I started using VSUM, a much 
    maligned product by Patti Hoffman, to create small subcollections based on 
    identical backgrounds of some viruses. It was easy to search the VSUM database 
    for a certain phrase and then look for and research the found viruses. This 
    way of organization produced collections based on a particular virus writer, 
    a virus writing group or any other common feature that was interesting. Since 
    I believed (and still do) in sharing I made these collections and updates 
    to them available through VX BBS's and later through Internet to anyone that 
    visited them. Initially I re-released updated collections but that caused 
    a lot of unnecessary downloading so ultimately I just released the updated 
    part.<br>
    Although I later found out that VSUM was not the accurate product I once thought 
    it to be it was a big help in organizing my collection and ultimately it was 
    the spark that got me started on VDAT. Today, although still updated at irregular 
    intervals, VSUM is desperately behind in the number of viruses covered and 
    is still inaccurate in many ways.</p>
  <p>While looking for new viruses I ran across many computer virus tools and 
    utilities. Although I had no clue what some of them did I decided to collect 
    them anyway. Now I will collect anything that touches the subject of computer 
    viruses: virus creators, polymorphic/mutation engines, e-zines, tutorials 
    and essays/papers. The number of diskettes containing viral material started 
    approaching a hundred and whenever I wanted to read/find something particular 
    I knew I had it really started to piss me off when I couldn't find it. Mostly 
    I ended up downloading the file in question again and storing it on a new 
    diskette. Thus the number of diskettes increased and the level of organization 
    decreased.</p>
  <p>While browsing through VSUM one evening the idea came. Wouldn't it be cool 
    to have all my collected information in one easy accessible, hypertext based, 
    database? It would certainly save a lot of searching and frustration. After 
    some searching I found a DOS-based hypertext development tool and in August 
    1995 I released the first attempt at VDAT.</p>
  <p>I am the first to acknowledge that the first couples of releases were pretty 
    lame but I think I managed to improve the product with every release. Somewhere 
    during this process I decided that the DOS hypertext version I was releasing 
    was just not good enough for some graphic features I wanted to include. Also 
    it was a pain in the butt to update. </p>
  <p>When I started looking for an equivalent Windows based hypertext tool I came 
    across a small database created with InfoCourier. After trying out the trial 
    version for some time I concluded that using HTML was not only easy but a 
    lot of HTML editing tools were available which made updating VDAT a lot less 
    complicated. So I bought (no kidding) the full version of InfoCourier and 
    started the conversion of VDAT for DOS to VDAT for Windows. </p>
  <p>Version 1.9 for DOS and version 1.0 for Windows were each other's equivalent 
    and although some people asked me to maintain a DOS version soon I noticed 
    keeping both updated was just not feasible and I decided to discontinue the 
    DOS version. In the mean time the "phenomenon" of VDAT was finding 
    it's way to more users, both in the VX scene and the among the general computer 
    user. Most reactions I got were supportive and many people supplied me with 
    material I could use for VDAT.</p>
  <p>While keeping VDAT updated I was still very much into collecting viruses. 
    When I started making my <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/collect.htm">collections and their updates</a> 
    available through a limited access web site a lot of people contacted me with 
    either requests or offers for trade. All this created a nice flow of new stuff 
    that allowed me to release updates to my collections every once in a while. 
    Although these collections and their updates were created for my own purposes 
    many fellow collectors and maybe some newbie virus writers seem to enjoy them 
    too. After a period of limited access I decided to make everything I produced 
    available to whoever wanted it although I found that 10 Mb was not enough 
    to run a satisfying web site. My ISP during that period was very "open" 
    about all this and I never had any complaints or requests to remove my virus 
    files even though I had expected them. </p>
  <p>Since I had a "normal" job too and all this computer virus collecting 
    was just a hobby not a lot of time was left to give my web site the look I 
    wanted it to have. All over the Web new virus sites popped up and died out, 
    most with better looks than mine had. For a while the WCIVR had a gigantic 
    number of computer viruses available for download, initially for free later 
    they started using ratios. These were the fun times for collecting viruses. 
  </p>
  <p>All my efforts of keeping my collections, my web site and VDAT updated were 
    decreasing the available time for keeping my virus collection up to date. 
    Although I still collected viruses I could find no time to ID, scan and organize 
    them properly. Also the increasing numbers of different viruses played havoc 
    with my initial method of organizing my collection, it was all very time consuming. 
  </p>
  <p>Although most reactions to my efforts were positive the number of negative 
    reactions was increasing. Apparently some people felt that their intellectual 
    property was violated when I decided to include some of their material in 
    one of my collections. The lack of time, the collection that was in disarray, 
    the effort of updating an unsatisfying web site, the lack of available web 
    space and the increasing number of negative reactions caused me to rethink 
    my goals. After an interim period of a web site with only VDAT available I 
    decided to fully pull the plug. The only thing I was going to release publicly 
    in the future was VDAT and that would have its own web site. To the contrary 
    to what most people thought the negative reactions were not the sole reason 
    for me quitting my site, they were just the last straw. </p>
  <p>In the wake of all this I was flooded with e-mail and although I must say 
    all of them were supportive some thought I was "giving in" and that 
    I should "stand up" to the negative reactions. Like I mentioned 
    the above, these reactions were not the main reason just the straw that broke 
    the camel's back. </p>
  <p>After the demise of my main web site I finally had some time to rearrange 
    my virus collection. While doing so I found out that the lack of attention 
    to my collection had caused me to fall behind in the numbers of viruses I 
    had collected and I frantically looked for the missing material. Luckily some 
    of my more solid contacts from the past came through and helped me out bringing 
    my collection back up to speed. </p>
  <p>The main emphasis of my hobby is again collecting viruses and a by-product 
    is the continued release of VDAT. My subcollections and their updates have 
    stopped, maybe not forever but certainly for the near future. If they ever 
    are reinstated they will not be available to the general collector but only 
    to a select few. </p>
  <p>In the years I have been collecting viruses I have never been a member of 
    a group. I always thought that maintaining the "middle-of-the-road" 
    and being an independent produced the best results. Being a member of a particular 
    group tends to limit access to work from another group. After the demise of 
    my web site I found that at a certain point in one's virus collection it is 
    impossible to add a substantial number of new viruses without being part of 
    a certain traders world. That is why I decided for, and requested, membership 
    of <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/tradgrps.htm#VTC">VTC</a> (Virus Trading Center), the only such 
    group around. Many of the members I knew from the past and although some have 
    been members of virus writing groups none are actively producing viruses. 
    I must say that it was a good move, the exchange of new virus material is 
    solid and worthwhile.</p>
  <p>In the meantime I have moved back from the US to Europe where I sometimes 
    have my collecting attempts rudely interrupted by my employer who insists 
    on sending me to weird courses and places. With the addition of a new hard 
    disk and CD writer my collection slowly gets more breathing room. Exchanges 
    of regular CD updates to our collections between VTC members greatly enhance 
    collection stability and prevent possible data loss.</p>
  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="b"></a>2. Why collect viruses?</font></b></p>
  <p>When asked about my hobbies the answer "I collect computer viruses" 
    produces reactions that range from "Are you insane?" to "Haven't 
    you got anything better to do?" to "Cool, tell me more!" Like 
    I said before, I tend to compare collecting viruses to collecting other wide 
    ranging categories of objects. Throughout the ages people have been known 
    to collect anything they could get their hands on. The physical form of an 
    object, or the lack thereof it in this case, should not limit someone in collecting 
    it. Most collections will center around someone's fascination with a certain 
    subject and the same holds true for a computer virus collection. This fascination 
    can range from the illicit nature of viruses, the sometimes-innovative programming 
    techniques used to a fascination with so called "artificial life". 
    The "why" does not really matter, the satisfaction it generates 
    does.</p>
  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="c"></a>3. How to collect computer viruses?</font></b></p>
  <p>I have told you how I started collecting viruses a couple of years ago but 
    with the rapid growth of the Internet there are now far better ways to start 
    a collection. It is now a lot easier to find a large number of viruses, it 
    just takes a little effort and a little patience. With the demise of BBS's 
    Internet is now the best choice to start a new collection. Getting access 
    to Internet is therefore paramount and a basic knowledge on how to surf the 
    Web is a prerequisite. A lot of viruses, necessary utilities and AV programs 
    can be found on the World Wide Web and IRC. Since many virus oriented channels 
    on IRC can be newbie unfriendly the WWW is presently the best bet to start 
    a virus collection.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a name="ca"></a><b> Areas of interest</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you start collecting viruses you have to set some goals and determine 
    your area of interest. Just like with most collections determining certain 
    boundaries will prevent an overwhelming chaos. Like I mentioned earlier I 
    initially just collected one variant per family. After some time I found that 
    that was too limited since the bulk of viruses are variants of another virus. 
    Another limitation I initially imposed was to collect viruses and only viruses. 
    The underground scene of which computer viruses are considered a part also 
    has areas of hacking, cracking and phreaking. The products of these areas 
    get mixed and this creates confusion for some collectors.</p>
  <p>One of the most important features of a computer virus is its replicative 
    nature. Something that is not meant to replicate is not a virus, so a Trojan 
    Horse is not virus. Many Trojan Horses have virus like behavior or payloads 
    but since they do not replicate they do not belong in a pure virus collection. 
    Initially the well-known AV software F-Prot did not even support detection 
    and removal of Trojan Horse software. With the recent rise of many "remote 
    access" Trojan Horses most AV products will now detect and remove this 
    "malware".</p>
  <p>Another limitation some collectors have adopted is the technical background 
    of a virus. Many do not consider macro viruses or script viruses "real" 
    viruses since they are so "easy" to produce and the author does 
    not need a large programming background. This is a choice some make but personally 
    I think such a limitation is not realistic. Macro viruses replicate and are 
    now one of the bigger virus problems for the average computer user and should 
    be included in a virus collection. A grey area in virus collection is the 
    so-called "intended" virus. It is not really a virus because for 
    some reason, programming error or compiling error, it malfunctions and does 
    not replicate. Most AV software will detect these samples as such. </p>
  <p>Virus collection samples exist in many forms. The original source code, the 
    assembled object file, the linked first generation binary, an infected victim 
    binary, an infected goat file, debug script, UUE encoded script, boot sector 
    images, disk images (Teledisk TDO), incorrectly compiled code and disassembled 
    source code. So what to collect? One of the lessons learned in the years I 
    have been collecting viruses is to save everything you get your hands on. 
    Fill up those floppies (yeah, I know), ZIP disks or CDR's with all the files 
    you get even if you think you are collecting duplicates. Some day one of the 
    files in your archive will scan as a new virus, it still happens to me every 
    now and then. Also I still sometimes delete stuff I should not delete and 
    it is always good to have a backup somewhere.</p>
  <p>So even when I basically collect everything, meaning everything ends up on 
    some kind of storage medium the "real" collection is limited by 
    my boundaries. Basically I will include every sample that is detected by a 
    scanner (primarily F-Prot) in my collection. This includes macro viruses, 
    script viruses "intended" viruses, some virus construction kits 
    and now also "Trojan horses" detected by that scanner. Since most 
    scanners will scan inside ZIP files I alphabetically sort every sample into 
    a ZIP file after I have generically renamed the files (FA000001.EXE to FA000002.COM 
    etc.). I have created separate ZIP files for Macro, Batch, Script and Windows 
    viruses since these viruses represent readily identifiable viral techniques.</p>
  <p>As I mentioned before I collect anything that touches on the subject of computer 
    viruses. That includes virus creation software, specific polymorphic and mutation 
    engines and any specific tool created in the development of computer viruses 
    (tunneling tools, boot sector dropper tools, routines and other engines). 
    I think this software is essential to a proper virus collection and should 
    be included in the organization of such a collection.<br>
    Many of the virus creation kits are very popular in the "underground" 
    scene, are very easy to find and are available through many Internet sources. 
    Due to the nature of the software and the fact that these files "travel" 
    around accidental or even intentional infection of virus creation files is 
    very possible. Like with all files handled while collecting viruses care has 
    to be taken to avoid infection but special care has be taken to include "clean" 
    samples of virus creation software in a collection.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a name="cb"></a> Collection purity</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>All samples collected will not be of the same quality. Like I mentioned before, 
    virus samples exist in many forms and many of these samples have, to put it 
    mildly, been "around". While going through all these stations many 
    virus samples will lose some if their quality, some will be corrupted and 
    many will be in their umpteenth generation. Arguably the cleanest virus sample 
    is the one generated with the original source code, a so-called first generation 
    sample. Some first generation samples will show different behavior than subsequent 
    generations and many newer and sophisticated viruses will change with every 
    generation (polymorphic). As long as these different generations will be detected 
    as one and the same virus variant they will be detected as duplicates in a 
    collection even though they might not be. Some viruses change so much between 
    generations that they will be detected as different variants of that virus 
    (WM.CAP being a good example).</p>
  <p>Ideally a virus collection should have the original source code, a first 
    generation sample, an infected goat file and an infected "real life" 
    victim of every virus. You do not need me to tell you that this is just not 
    feasible. So how much are you willing to let your standards slide? Personally 
    I will accept any sample of a virus that is not in my collection even if it 
    is identified as being "damaged". Some of the earlier VX BBS's had 
    the annoying habit of "<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epvirlib.htm#ENV">stamping</a>" 
    their virus samples with their BBS "addy". This could cause virus 
    scanners to ID the sample as a new variant or even totally miss it. After 
    deleting the "addy" from the sample with a hex editor the sample 
    will scan fine but it remains a unnecessary hassle. So when given the choice 
    between 2 similar samples I will keep the one that is as close as possible 
    to the original.</p>
  <p>Compared to a "normal" virus to get from the source code to the 
    binary form of a boot sector virus an extra step is required. A "dropper" 
    will drop a compiled image of the boot sector virus to the target boot sector. 
    I consider these droppers legitimate virus collection material. Ideally they 
    should be combined with images from the infected boot sector. <br>
    Sometimes poorly compiled samples (by persons unfamiliar with TASM/MASM) will 
    often be identified as a "dropper" or an "unknown" and 
    until correctly identified will muddy a collection. </p>
  <p>Sometimes collectors, mistakenly or on purpose, have the nasty habit of renaming 
    object files to either .COM or .EXE files. Some scanners will identify these 
    samples as "unknowns". One way of determining the value of this 
    sample to a collection is simply linking the object file and then scanning 
    the resulting code. The majority of such treated files are known virus samples. 
    You can also use any hex viewer to quickly view the header of the file, which 
    will often show the file name of the original source code file. After seeing 
    hundreds of these source codes the name often is familiar. Since they are 
    just an intermediate stage of a virus object files, renamed or not, are not 
    material for a "clean" virus collection.</p>
  <p>There are many ways of cleaning a file infected by an prepending or appending 
    virus. Depending on the virus and on the software used to clean the file the 
    resulting code can range from "not functional" to "functional" 
    to "pristine". Sometimes a file can be recovered to its original 
    state but often it is just the functionality that is recovered. Remnants of 
    a virus can be left behind and depending on the AV software be incorrectly 
    identified as an new "unknown" variant or even as the original infecting 
    virus. Determining if this "hit" by a scanner really is a virus 
    needs more in depth research e.g. disassembling the virus. Most virus collectors 
    do not have the expertise and the time, nor feel the need to put in this extra 
    effort. Since the majority of the virus researchers and AV companies do have 
    the required expertise and manpower they will research these questionable 
    samples further. The result is that virus collections of researchers and the 
    AV community not only tend to be larger but also of a higher quality than 
    collectors' collections.</p>

    <li><b><a name="cc"></a> Virus Naming</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just as there is a wide range of personalities and characters in the general 
    public the same is true for virus writers. Many virus authors name their viruses 
    and if you believe the interviews with these authors many of them think it 
    is one of the hardest parts of virus writing. Other authors do not really 
    care about naming their creations and emphasize the technical features of 
    their viruses. AV scanner IDs often differ from names given to viruses by 
    their creators and it appears that this is many times done on purpose. In 
    this continuous ritual between AV and VX some virus authors even include suggestions 
    for names to AV companies in their viruses. Since the origin of viruses does 
    not have a high priority in naming computer viruses AV companies will group 
    viruses with similar structures, layout or operating ways in families even 
    though these viruses might have different authors and might have originated 
    from different parts of the world. Variants of the Jerusalem virus might be 
    given totally different names by their authors but if the only difference 
    is found in the text contained in the virus an AV product will ID the viruses 
    in the same family / group and will give them similar names.</p>
  <p>Virus naming is one of the more confusing parts of virus collecting. During 
    the early period of computer viruses, the late '80's, there was no consensus 
    between AV companies on how to name detected computer viruses and different 
    names were used for the same virus depending on the AV product used. Around 
    the change of the decade an organization known as CARO (Computer Anti-virus 
    Researchers' Organization) formed a committee with the objective of reducing 
    the confusion in virus naming. The virus naming convention that was chosen 
    can be found in a paper called "<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epcaronm.htm">The CARO way of 
    naming viruses</a>" available on the WWW and included in VDAT.</p>
  <p>The convention that was chosen certainly decreased the naming confusion and 
    that was especially useful for a virus collection based on scanner IDs. Although 
    most well known AV companies are members of CARO the virus naming habits of 
    many of these companies have remained confusing and have never reached a CARO 
    structure. There are still major differences in naming between many AV products 
    and even companies like Frisk Software International (F-Prot) and Kaspersky 
    Lab (AVP) that have strong liaisons and technology exchange have a widely 
    differing naming convention. For collection purposes I recommend using the 
    shareware (freeware for private use) DOS version of F-Prot. It detects and 
    cleans a wide-ranging number of viruses of all kinds (DOS, Windows, Macro, 
    and Script) and a limited number of Trojan Horses. The F-Prot scanner is especially 
    useful to structure a virus collection because it detects a large number of 
    variants and names these variants the most consistent of all AV products. 
    Another well known product that detects a large number of the same viruses 
    will e.g. name most viruses produced with the IVP construction kit as "IVP 
    based" while F-Prot will ID specific variants IVP viruses.</p>

      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Like I mentioned before I mainly use F-Prot to organize my collection. I 
    have established alphabetized ZIP archives with F-Prot ID'd viruses. I have 
    also created separate archives for batch, macro and Windows viruses. The resulting 
    scan log of the archives is then processed by my favorite, VS2000. This successor 
    to the classic Virsort processes scan logs by major AV products and builds 
    database files that can be used to look for new additions to the collection. 
    Whenever I get a bunch of "new" viruses I will scan them with F-Prot, 
    process the log with VS2000 and then have VS2000 produce an ASCII listing 
    of the collection. Looking at the list I can determine what viruses are new 
    to my collection and I will move these new files to my \NEWSCAN directory. 
    I will rename all these new files to a new format FNEWXXXX.XXX and lastly 
    I will scan the \NEWSCAN with F-Prot. After one of these minor updates I end 
    up with two logs, my main collection FPXXXXXX.LOG and my \NEWSCAN log NEW.LOG. 
    These logs processed by VS2000 produce a current collection inventory. Once 
    every two months or so I will incorporate the files in the \NEWSCAN directory 
    in my main archives and after scanning the archives again with F-Prot create 
    a new FPXXXXXX.LOG. My intent is to build a similar archive database for the 
    other popular scanner, AVP. This because AVP will detect many viruses that 
    F-Prot does not detect and visa versa.<br>
    All the actual or suspected virus samples are kept on a hard disk partition 
    that I rescan with every new scanner release or new signature definition. 
    This will produce newly detected viruses in many "old" virus samples 
    after a new scanner release.<br>
    After every new release of VDAT I create a CDR with all the computer virus 
    related material that I have collected. Not only is it a valuable backup in 
    case of system failures or an accidental infection but it is also easy to 
    have everything together on one single medium.<br>
    This is basically the way I sort my collection but that does not mean it is 
    THE way to do it. I know some collectors that have a totally different approach 
    to a similar collection. Another fine tool to organize a virus collection 
    is Tally's <a href="http://www.coderz.net/tally/vk.html">VirusKeeper</a> 
    available on his web site. My experiences with it are limited but I am thinking 
    about using it. I suggest you use the method you feel happy with, that lets 
    you keep the collection organized and that keeps the required maintenance 
    to a minimum.</p>

  <p>You would be amazed at how many times a particular virus sample has been

    the viral material is a must. Many programs to weed any kind of file base 
    are available, most will use some kind of CRC method to find duplicate files. 
    The best known among virus collectors is TBWEEDER, which is still available 
    all around the scene. Other suitable programs are PGWEED, VWEED and Rose's 
    File Weeder (also capable of file renaming). I suggest collectors start using 
    file-weeding software from the outset of their collection. It saves considerable 
    disk space and more importantly, scan time.</p>

      <p><b><a name="cdc"></a> Unpacking / Decrypting</b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>File packing software like PKLITE, Diet, LZEXE etc. will considerably change 
    the binary image of a file. Some virus authors incorporate the packing technique 
    in their creations, which will result in a "packed" virus. These 
    "packed" viruses should be detected by software that have "<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epvirlib.htm#PACK">unpacking</a>" 
    support. Sometimes viruses are, intentionally or unintentionally, packed after 
    their initial compilation. This will produce varying results, some scanners 
    will properly detect the sample, some will detect variants and some samples 
    will be completely missed. For collection purposes it sometimes helps to unpack 
    a packed sample just to see if any telling ASCII strings can be found in the 
    sample. Packing a virus should not change the functionality of a virus, sometimes 
    it does change its detectability.<br>
    Encrypting a virus sample with software like Protect, ProtEXE etc. has similar 
    effects on functionality and detectability but the objective of using this 
    software is totally different. While packing software is used to decrease 
    the size of virus samples or to limit the file size increase when using prepending 
    or appending viruses, file encryption software is mainly used to hide the 
    "tricks" the virus uses. Similar to incorporating packing features 
    in the virus source many viruses today use an internal encryption scheme to 
    avoid detection. Many mutation and polymorphic engines used in viruses today 
    have been developed to make viruses harder to detect and if detected harder 
    to unravel.<br>
    Many tools to unpack or decrypt popular schemes are available, the ones I 
    use are UNP and GTR (Generic Tracer) available as free/shareware.</p>

  <p>Disassembling virus samples is a time consuming task that requires some knowledge

    to understand a particular virus and to learn new tricks. Certainly virus 
    researchers of AV companies will use the disassembling method to find ways 
    to detect specific viruses. For a virus collector the task of disassembling 
    viruses if far too time consuming to do effectively. With the number of new

  <p>One of the hurdles of researching or dissecting a new virus is that a victim 
    file often blurs the exact specifics of that virus. Victim files are often 
    large and the exact binary image of the virus is often hard to find since 
    the exact image of the clean victim file might not be known. For the purpose 
    of exactly determining what a virus looks like researchers have developed 
    so called goat files. These files have an exactly known layout and length 
    and when infected by a particular virus the difference between the clean and 
    the infected goat file will tell researchers a lot about the virus. Infected 
    goat files can also be used to determine the differences between certain virus 
    generations.<br>
    Many goat files are specific to the file structure (COM, EXE, NE, PE, SYS, 
    Word document etc.) and mostly contain instructions to create a certain file 
    length (NOPs, etc.). Goat file sets will have multiple pre-determined file 
    lengths since some viruses have instructions to avoid target files smaller 
    or bigger than a certain length. Many viruses have anti goat routines programmed 
    into them causing goat file programmers to create even more sophisticated 
    goat file generators. <br>
    Popular goat file packages are Goat File Creator Package (COM, EXE, NE, PE, 
    SYS), MakeGoat (Word) and RoseGoat (several formats). A considerable part 
    of most virus collections are infected goat files and they are often easily 
    identified by their structure and some inserted strings.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>So how do you start a virus collection? With the popularity of Internet it 
    has become a lot easier to find virus samples but even now the cry "I 
    need a virus, where can I get one?" can be heard many times. The simple 
    use of a search engine with "virii" as a search condition will produce 
    hundreds of hits. This completely incorrect and dyslexic plural form of the 
    word "virus" (How about the plural plural of "viriis" 
    I have seen being used) will filter out many legitimate hits concerning human 
    or animal viruses. Looking for "computer virus" or "computer 
    viruses" will most often produce links to AV sites. When one pro-virus 
    site has been found the available links will most likely produce more and 
    then it is just a matter of following links and downloading material. A shortcut 
    to finding your own links is to visit <a href="http://www.coderz.net/tally">Tally's 
    Link Reference</a>, the largest collection of computer virus related links 
    available on the web. A <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/tallkref.htm">VDAT version</a> is available 
    too.<br>
    Now is just a matter of getting the large and available virus archives and

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Just like with any other collection (stamps, dolls, you name it) at a certain 
    point the collection stagnates due to lack of new material. The best way to 
    increase the quality and quantity of your collection is to start trading. 
    I know it must seem pretty hopeless to start out as a new collector and hear 
    about all these collections of tens of thousands of viruses. Perseverance 
    and luck should help. Sometimes you come across something everyone has missed 
    and this can be used trading for other stuff. Having the right contacts also 
    helps, don't start yelling at and demanding from them though. You'd be amazed 
    how much goodwill a little politeness and sincerity will get you. Do not expect 
    to go from 10 to 10000 viruses within a day either, not only is it not feasible 
    but you would also skip part of the fun of collecting.<br>
    Even after collecting for years a certain "dead zone" can be reached. 
    One has collected the majority of the available viruses and the collection 
    seems to stagnate. When this happens to several collectors with similar objectives 
    it is time to organize the trading. It is time to find new sources and to 
    find especially hard to get samples. The resulting collective of virus collectors 
    (is this case the Virus Trade Center) seems to produce better results than 
    the single members put together. Here perseverance and luck added to reputations 
    and connections that have been build throughout the years help. The result 
    is a collection of viruses hard to equal in quality and quantity outside AV 
    archives.</p>

      <p><b><a name="cec"></a> Self protection</b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Handling computer viruses can be hazardous, even though I think less hazardous 
    than most people would like to make you believe. The majority of computer 
    viruses is harmless and can be easily detected and cleaned if necessary but 
    some can definitely ruin a perfectly fine day.<br>
    All precautions you can imagine will not eliminate the risks of a computer 
    virus creating havoc on your own (collector's) computer. If you are not prepared 
    to handle this eventuality DO NOT start collecting viruses. I have had many 
    requests for viruses from people who did not even know computer basics ("How 
    do I start an ASM file?" etc.). Do not collect viruses because you think 
    it is cool or for malicious purposes. Even without a virus collection you 
    run a small risk of being infected by a computer virus but inviting them on 
    your computer certainly increases this risk.<br>
    There are many ways to minimize the risk of infection and not all of them 
    are expensive. Here are a couple of my suggestions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Use a separate computer for all your virus material. (Not cheap but feasible)</li>
    <li> Use separate hard disks / partitions for all your virus material.</li>
    <li>Use several (more than one) AV programs. Resident and/or on-demand.</li>
    <li>Use a behavior blocker.</li>
    <li>Use of ZIP or other archives helps prevent accidental execution while 
      still being able to scan the collection</li>
    <li>Have a clean boot disk with an AV program and any needed tools and drivers.</li>
    <li>Perform regular clean-boot scans</li>
    <li>Limit any form of auto-execution </li>
  </ol>
  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="d"></a>4. Collection contents</font></b></p>
  <p><b><a name="da"></a> Code</b></p>
  <p>This should of course be the main emphasis of any virus collection since 
    this is the essence and ultimate form of a computer virus. As mentioned before 
    computer virus code (binary) can have a varying degree of quality depending 
    on where the sample has come from and where the sample has been. Ideally the 
    sample you collect should be as close to the first generation as possible 
    but as long as the sample is identical it is good enough. With the large number 
    of new viruses detected every week it is very time consuming to compare multiple 
    samples of the same virus and to select the one with the highest quality. 
    Personally I save every sample I come across, maybe someday I will have time 
    to do a quality comparison of viruses in my collection.<br>
    Most collectors today will measure their collection using the number of hits 
    they get in their scan results. Many of these scan results contain hits that 
    show "unknown", "damaged" or "dropper" viruses. 
    While detected as viruses they might not be fully functional or even new. 
    Quite a few "unknown" viruses will later be detected as "known" 
    viruses when an updated signature file is used. Until other samples of these 
    viruses can be found you should include these samples of lesser quality but 
    whenever possible they should be exchanged for better samples.<br>
    While scanners like F-Prot are known for detecting a multitude of variants 
    they are not perfect. My original collection contained virus samples straight 
    from the source (the author) that were never detected by F-Prot. Maybe these 
    samples have never reached the AV researchers, maybe they are not viruses 
    (I doubt it since they replicate). Some samples I have in my collection have 
    been detected as "new or modified" and "could be" for 
    the several years without ever being positively identified. Also I have some 
    samples of similar viruses that still are different (when disassembled or 
    hex viewed) that are ID'd as one and the same virus. <br>
    The very good scanner AVP will identify many viruses it detects based on its 
    origin. Most viruses created with virus creation kits, while different, will 
    be identified with the same ID. (NRLG-based, DREG-based etc.). This system 
    is not always used consistently since some viruses created by these kits will 
    be identified in detail. If used for collection purposes this lack of detail 
    in identifying samples will hamper the sorting of a virus collection and necessitate 
    the use of multiple scanners to produce multiple sortable scan lists.<br>
    This leaves the collector with the dilemma on how and what to collect. Personally 
    I mainly collect using F-Prot scan results while building a parallel collection 
    using AVP scan results and one of material which I know to be viral but that 
    is either not detected or not identified to the necessary detail. I'll leave 
    the choice for your collection up to you.</p>
  <p><b><a name="db"></a> Sources</b></p>
  <p>Source codes are the recipes of computer viruses and will tell a lot about 
    the techniques used in and features of viruses. They exist in many forms ranging 
    from the original (author's) code to many (commented or not) disassemblies. 
    While not all source codes will allow for (re)creation of the virus (quite 
    a few will produce errors) many will give a collector the opportunity to compile 
    a clean virus sample. The availability of these source codes has aided the 
    development of many virus variants, some virus author "wannabes" 
    just change some ASCII strings to produce their "own" viruses resulting 
    in virus Xxxx.ZZ. The lack of technical know how with most of these "wannabes" 
    has led to the large number of garbage and intended viruses available in most 
    collections. Knowing how to use an assembler and linking software is a prerequisite 
    to creating viruses and the improper use of this software is a contributing 
    factor to some of the virus junk around.<br>
    While certainly a part of my virus collection source codes are not the main 
    emphasis of it. I will save all I can get my hands on and I used to pair source 
    code and binary for my subcollections when I still released those. Nowadays 
    I simply don't have the time to actively research all source codes I have 
    and I limit myself to using them for research for VDAT.</p>
  <p> <b><a name="dc"></a>Zines</b></p>
  <p>One of the most important sources of information for collecting viruses is 
    the continuous release of new <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/ezinemen.htm">VX e-zines</a>. Not only 
    do most contain code and sources of many new viruses, they also offer the 
    collector a lot of important insider news about the scene. Even if the information 
    offered is not important or even rehashed old information the zines themselves 
    are collector's items. The diversity of origins is large and finding a new 
    or unknown zine from some new source is always fun. The quality of e-zines 
    runs from the basic few Kb ASCII based text file to the large, graphically 
    complex and user friendly (mouse and/or menu driven) professional product. 
    A disadvantage of the large diversity of languages used is that a lot of them 
    need advanced lingual skills to read. While the majority is written using 
    the English language, zines using Spanish, Russian, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese 
    and Italian are known.</p>
  <p><b><a name="dd"></a> Tools &amp; engines</b></p>
  <p>Next to the pure binary code and source code of a virus any tool that is 
    used to improve or create a virus can be a part of a virus collection, it 
    depends on where the collector in question draws the line. Many of these tools 
    have been developed as part of creating a computer virus but quite a few have 
    been developed as a separate tool, which can be used in any virus by either 
    incorporating it, or by applying it after the initial virus development.<br>
    Most<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/enginmen.htm"> tools and engines</a> originate from the continuos 
    intellectual battle between AV and VX. Any techniques developed by one side 
    will often cause the development of opposing techniques from the other side. 
    The VX aim to avoid detection has caused the emergence of many polymorphic 
    and mutation engines. The ability of anti virus companies to detect the viruses 
    using these engines has led to even more sophisticate engines.<br>
    Other tools for a virus collection are so-called boot sector injectors that 
    will allow for the insertion of specific boot sector viruses on selected boot 
    sectors. Although called virus creation kits by some they are just virus manipulation 
    tools since no new viruses are created in the process.<br>
    For collection purposes I use VDAT as a guideline on what to collect and I 
    update VDAT with collection material I find that has not been included. I 
    have heard of quite a few other collectors that also use VDAT as a collection 
    guideline so it is a good place to start if your are looking for guidance.</p>
  <p><b><a name="de"></a> Creation kits</b></p>
  <p>In collecting <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/creators.htm">virus creation kits</a> for a computer 
    virus collection you will notice some ambiguity. One of the first items a 
    new collector or newbie author will try to get is a virus creation kit. While 
    most virus authors denounce the use of these kits as being "lame" 
    almost all of them are created by these same authors. Most will see them as 
    an exercise in programming created for and to be used by "lamers". 
    Some will acknowledge that although they can be a good tool to "learn" 
    how to make viruses they lack the originality and technological prowess many 
    virus authors pride themselves on.<br>
    Started by NuKE's Virus Creation Laboratory (<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</a>) 
    and Phalcon Skism's Mass Produced Code Generator (<a href="#CREATRS2.HTM#PSMPC">PS-MPC</a>) 
    they were quickly followed by others. Most viruses produced with virus creation 
    kits can be detected and cleaned by any self respecting AV software but the 
    simple fact that you did not have to have any knowledge of computer viruses 
    to create one has always been an attraction. Due to the ease of virus production 
    with a construction kit a large percentage of viruses detected have been created 
    by such kits. Although not inherently dangerous when using a proper AV program 
    the mere number of them creates slower scan times, bigger signature files 
    and just a nuisance in general.<br>
    The virus creation software I have seen ranges from the simple, generic virus 
    cloning tool that just reproduces existing viruses to relatively sophisticated 
    software that produces original code with many user selectable features. </p>
  <p>With the popularity of Windows 95/98 many DOS viruses became limited in their 
    functionality and since most popular virus creation kits produce DOS viruses 
    their use was similarly limited. The relative ease with which authors started 
    creating macro viruses caused some of them to try their luck at creating a 
    macro virus creation kit. It appeared that the creation of such kits was just 
    as easy as creating viruses. The popularity of Microsoft Word and the ignorance 
    of its users and Microsoft caused the macro virus to be the most encountered 
    virus of today's computer world. Futile AV patches from MS Word 95 to MS Word 
    97 did not even slow down the construction of macro viruses or of macro virus 
    construction kits. On the eve of the release of MS Office 2000 the first virus 
    compatible with it has already been released. This relative ease with which 
    these viruses are developed and the multiple features of VBA has caused the 
    release of many macro virus generators, including some for Excel and Access.<br>
    The first kit creating Windows viruses was supposedly released by the Hackerz 
    Networkx but the group disappeared before this could be confirmed. No doubt 
    someone else will pick up where they left off and we will see a Windows virus 
    creation kit in the near future.<br>

    can be considered pillars of the pro virus community. Most virus creators 
    are only too happy to share their knowledge with the rest of the world and 
    will write extensive tutorials on a wide-ranging number of pro virus subjects. 
    A lot of virus authors are self-taught and use many of these tutorials as 
    learning material. The main source of these tutorials are the ever-present 
    e-zines release by many groups in the VX community.<br>
    As a virus collector these tutorials can be collection subjects and sources 
    of information. While I do not collect them separately (I keep them with their 
    source / e-zine) I definitely use them in creating every new release of VDAT 
    and as such VDAT is my complete tutorial / essay collection.</p>
  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="e"></a>5. Philosophies</font></b></p>
  <p><b><a name="ea"></a>Codes of conduct</b></p>
  <p>To put it mildly computer viruses are frowned upon by the majority of computer 
    users, professional or amateur. The main cause for this attitude I think is 
    the popular (mis)conception that all computer viruses are destructive. Depending 
    on the exact language used computer viruses can be considered invasive and 
    an uninvited waste of valuable computer resources like CPU cycles, storage 
    space, memory or bandwidth. That is why being anything but opposed to computer 
    viruses is at least considered poor judgement. Opinions range from "bad 
    taste" to "criminal" and some countries and some US states 
    have included computer viruses and their usage in computer crime laws. Since 
    computer viruses don't observe geographical or political borders they appear 
    and originate all over the world. Collecting viruses can range from legal 
    in one country, to not illegal in another to punishable by law in a third 
    country/state. Regardless of the legalities around computer viruses I think 
    certain codes of conduct have to be observed to be able to successfully start, 
    maintain, improve and enlarge a virus collection:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Screen requests for virus samples: 
      <ul>
        <li>Do not purposely spread viruses to unsuspecting computer users.</li>
        <li>Do not honor requests for viruses with the purpose of destroying data.</li>
        <li>Determine level of know how of requester and act accordingly.</li>
        <li>Honor requests to keep samples private / within a certain scope.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Protect identities of virus sample suppliers when requested to do so.</li>
    <li>When asked to trade observe realistic trading quota/ratios.</li>
    <li>Do not "pad" scanner logs or trades with junk.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b><a name="eb"></a>AV connections</b></p>
  <p>Connections and exchange of files / know how within the triangle of the anti-virus 
    community (commercial or otherwise), virus collectors and the pro-virus community 
    are generally more an exception than a rule. Most members of the AV community 
    tend to be hesitant to show any such connection publicly although I'm sure 
    these connections exist at least at some levels. Rumors that AV companies 
    and personalities monitor and visit the WWW and IRC using pseudonyms/handles 
    can not be confirmed. Personally I've been approached a couple of times by 
    members of the AV community with some general questions but never with specific 
    requests.</p>
  <p>Chances of getting virus samples from AV researchers / companies are slim. 
    The agreed codes of conduct within the AV community generally preclude exchange 
    of virus samples with someone outside this AV community.</p>
  <p><b><a name="ec"></a>Collector vs. researcher</b></p>
  <p>A virus collector is not by default a virus researcher although some would 
    like to think they are. The reverse does not have to be true either but often 
    is. Both touch on certain similar areas of interest but they have different 
    goals. While the collector does not always care how a particular virus works 
    as long as it is a "new" virus for his collection the researcher's 
    main objective should be to research the specific techniques used in a virus 
    and as a result possibly find a cure for the virus. Some researchers are only 
    interested in the workings of a virus as a computer program or as a perceived 
    form of artificial life.</p>
  <p><b><a name="ed"></a>Collector vs. writer</b></p>
  <p>Similar to the previous relationship a virus collector is not by default 
    a virus writer but many virus writers tend to collect viruses at some level. 
    Some writers will collect for the sake of collecting but most collect only 
    certain viruses with the intent to learn / leech techniques for future use. 
    Outside the general archives of viruses available on the WWW virus writers 
    are a primary source for new viruses and relationships between collectors 
    and writers should be carefully cultured. These often close relationships 
    will cause the anti virus community to think of collectors and writers as 
    part of one and the same "underground" faction. Most virus collectors 
    though are not virus writers and should not be labeled with the same morals 
    as the standard "disgruntled, frustrated, revenge motivated teen".</p>
  <p><b><a name="ee"></a>Legalities</b></p>
  <p>Depending on what part of the world you are from any act involving a computer 
    virus might be illegal. Sometimes laws are straightforward and specifically 
    mention the term or phenomenon of a computer virus but more often the laws 
    become a matter of interpretation. Depending on the exact terminology used 
    in a law, computer viruses might be considered part of computer crime or there 
    might be a definite legal difference between e.g. creating or spreading a 
    virus. Some laws will allow for consensual virus exchange as long as all parties 
    are aware of the material being exchanged. Most laws that address the phenomenon 
    will prohibit the malicious or subversive use of a computer virus.<br>
    Unless you are looking for an exciting hassle with your local (federal, national 
    or state) law enforcement I suggest you read up on the latest computer crime 
    / legalities / laws of your area.</p>
  <p><b><a name="ef"></a>Common views</b></p>
  <p>Only a small part of people using computers knows more than average about 
    computer viruses. The majority considers them dangerous and an invasion of 
    their "computer privacy". The facts about viruses most known to 
    the world not involved with viruses are the facts that are the least common 
    to those that are involved. The majority of virus creators consider damaging 
    payloads unnecessary, lame or even unethical (yes, even they have ethics even 
    though some others might not agree). There will always be a certain tension 
    between what all parties that are involved consider to be true and what really 
    is true. This will also lead to a lot of hype, some harmless, some pretty 
    stupid, and some intentional. Many a scare has been proved harmless but somewhere 
    someone will have benefited from the scare while the general audience is getting 
    more and more confused.<br>
    Another feature of these virus hypes is the virus hoax, the ignorance and 
    gullibility of many people has created waves of these virus hoaxes. For more 
    information on these hoaxes check out <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epfqhoax.htm">The Hoax FAQ</a>, 
    <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/ephoaxes.htm">It's the end of the world as we know it</a>, <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/ephoahyp.htm">Hoaxes 
    and Hypes</a> and visit<a href="http://www.kumite.com/myths/home.htm"> Rob 
    Rosenberg's site</a> on the subject.<br>
    The less than positive views on computer viruses lead to many knee jerk reactions. 
    Most web space providers will not allow viral code on their member's web sites 
    and some will not allow any material that could be considered pro computer 
    virus (tutorials, ezines etc.). Books written about the subject immediately 
    receive the "underground" stamp and Mark Ludwig's book Little Black 
    Book of Computer Viruses has been banned in France because it is too specific 
    in explaining computer viruses.<br>
    For me this entire hubbub adds to the joy of collecting viruses, it definitely 
    never is boring. Others don't like this part of collecting viruses and they 
    just accept it, but there is no way to avoid it if you want to collect viruses.</p>
  <p><b><font size="+1"><a name="f"></a>6. Information</font></b></p>
  <p>Quite a lot of detailed information can be found to help shape a virus collection. 
    Most AV companies maintain online virus databases that can be a great help 
    when initially structuring or when maintaining a collection. I personally 
    find the online database AVPVE by AVP (<a href="http://www.avp.ch/avpve">http://www.avp.ch/avpve</a>) 
    the most useful. Many fellow collectors find my virus scene database VDAT 
    a helpful tool to use as a guideline. Even though VSUM has lost a lot of its 
    value it still can be of use to find small details that help collecting. It 
    is still updated at irregular intervals (<a href="http://www.vsum.com/">http://www.vsum.com</a>).</p>
  <p>As mentioned before Vesselin Bontchev, a well-known AV guru, has written 
    a virus collecting / research essay that can be very helpful to a virus collector 
    although it is aimed more at the virus researcher. Called "<a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/epvirlib.htm">Analysis 
    and Maintenance of a Clean Virus Library</a>" it can be found on several 
    web sites and in VDAT.</p>
  <p><b><a name="fa"></a>Closing remarks</b></p>
  <p>I hope this little essay will be of help to others starting or maintaining 
    a virus collection. It is by no means meant as the sole solution, many other 
    techniques are available and specific personal preferences will lead to variants 
    of this solution.</p>
  <p>Additionally I hope that I have also explained and confirmed the position 
    I think I have in the sometimes-murky scene of computer viruses.</p>
  <p>As always I'm open to any positive or negative suggestions or comments in 
    general.</p>
