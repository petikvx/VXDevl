  <font size="+1">By Assembler Head </font></b><br>
  [January 1999]</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Please introduce yourself (about where you from, age, 
  hobbies,... etc)?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm 19 years old and I life in germany. Currently I'm a soldier. But this 
    year, when I have finished my military service, I want to study computer sience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>When did you start in computer?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Uhmm ... That's long ago. I think it was 1990. My father bought me a XT (8088 
    with 9.54 MHz, 20 MB HDD, 768[!]KB memory and a hercules graphics-card with 
    monochrom monitor). I had no games, so I started to learn DOS on my own. Later 
    I discovered GWBASIC, Turbo Pascal and of course Assembler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>And what was your first experience in computer virus?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That was in 1992 when a friend gave me a infected game. It was infected with 
    the Jerusalem-B virii. I discovered this beast very soon on my computer. Later 
    I got infected with Tequilla and Parity.Boot.B (who hasn't had it ?).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Where you get your handle?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From an old music CD by ICE-T. POWER I think... there is a rapper called 
    EVIL-E on it. I liked the music and the name very much so I decided to choose 
    this as my nick. Beside that it sounds very rude ;-).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How many computer language you know?</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> Basic :-)</li>
    <li> Turbo Pascal</li>
    <li> Assembler</li>
    <li> try to learn C++</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Are you join in virus group?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yep. I'm a proud member of the <a href="groups1.htm#CB">Codebreakers</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What your plan in your virus group?(if you join in...Congratulation 
  Evil-E) :-))</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Have fun, learn new things, find friends and maybe become famous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How many virus did you write till now?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many. But most of them are only test virii's that I never released :-(.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What's your favorite trick in Vx you write?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I like the INT 18_tech very much. Besides that I like all creative new tricks 
    to make virii's undetectable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>and favorite virus from all?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Got no favourite virii. I like everything that replicates ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Write virus engine too?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe sometime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do your close friends, parents, girlfriend know you 
  write Vx? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yep. My parents and close friends know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Why did you choose Vx not hacking, phreaking, crackers, 
  etc?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I like to create new life-forms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>You like warez?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sure ! Who not ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you like destructive virus?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nope. I don't like them. I like to create new things, not to destroy things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What AV are you using? why?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I like F-Prot. Dont ask me why ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Give a little picture about Vx in future? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I see a good, very infective, future on the new plattforms... What do you 
    want to infect today :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have e-mail, icq, or something to reach you?</b></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>You like to say some pedagogy to newbie?</b></font></p>
