<p>The author of the Chernobyl computer virus told investigators that he created 
  the bug hoping to humiliate and take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus 
  software providers, police said today. But he admitted he didn't expect 
  it to cause worldwide damage, a police statement said. Police added that a lack 
  of any local plaintiffs made it difficult to charge him. </p>
<p>“HE’S NOT A CRIMINAL here as long as no one registers a complaint,” a Taipei 
  police spokeswoman said. “All we know about problems with the virus is what 
  we’ve seen in foreign news reports.” Chen was questioned on suspicion of intentionally 
  spreading a computer virus, a crime that carries a possible three-year prison 
  term, and could be charged if victims come forth. </p>
<p>A bashful Chen, in brief comments after he was released, expressed remorse 
  and offered to help victims remove the virus from their computers. The Chernobyl 
  virus — known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen’s initials — had even pressed the 
  Chinese People’s Liberation Army to study antivirus programs to prevent it from 
  invading its computers, the police statement said.</p>
<p>Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of computer engineering 
  at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since graduated and has been undergoing 
  Taiwan’s mandatory two-year military service. Chen had spent long hours playing 
  computer games since entering college and was a frequent victim of computer 
  viruses when downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
  police statement said. “He said he created the highly vicious virus that could 
  avoid detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool of the 
  software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus programs that proved useless,” 
  the statement said. “He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. 
  He regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.” </p>
<p>The unusually destructive virus — timed to strike on April 26, the 13th anniversary 
  of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster — tries to erase a computer’s hard drive and 
  write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
  Computer experts said Chen might never be charged because he did not intend 
  to spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking millions 
  of dollars of damage compensation.</p>
