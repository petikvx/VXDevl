<P><B>ABSTRACT </B></P>

<P>The introduction of the computer into our already complex arsenal of
tools has opened a door to a world in which the limits are seemingly boundless.
The possibilities of electronic information and data exchange alone are
enough to boggle the mind. However, with the computer's acceptance and
its growing implementation, a debate has arisen concerning the manner in
which it is being utilized. </P>

<P>Today, we have a virtual stone wall separating two basic trains of thought.
On one hand, there are those who wish to make all computer information
and resources publicly available, regardless of impact or damage afforded
to unwitting users. On the other hand, we have computer professionals,
advocates and users who think potentially damaging information should be
more effectively managed and controlled, disallowing damaging code to escape
into the public domain. </P>

<P><B>THE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT OF COMPUTER ETHICS </B></P>

<P>Perhaps the birthplace of computer ethics was the at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The addition of a discarded Lincoln Labs TX-0 in 1958 created
a more personal and casual brotherhood in the computing environment at
MIT. It was soon after this machine was introduced that many of the more
inquiring minds attending the university became enthralled with it's presence
[1]. &quot;There was no one moment when it started to dawn on the TX-0
hackers that by devoting their technical abilities to computing with a
devotion rarely seen outside of monasteries they were the vanguard of a
daring symbiosis between man and machine&quot;, wrote Steven Levy, in his
landmark book, &quot;Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution&quot;.
This devotion to the computer led to their version of what they dubbed
&quot;The Hacker Ethic&quot;. This &quot;ethic&quot; had became an honor
code that outlined ground rules for the usage of the computer resources
and has survived to this day as the foundation of what is honorable in
the computer community. Although it has been twisted and mired in its journey
into the 1990's, its inception was sincere and beneficial to those who
created it during the early days. Levy outlined five platform values that
comprised the Hacker Ethic: </P>

<P><B>&quot;Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something
about the way the world works -- should be unlimited and total. Always
yield to the Hands-On Imperative!&quot; </B></P>

<P>As Steven Levy outlines in his book, this was the primary basis for
computer hacker values in the early days of computerdom. Hackers, as defined
in the above statement, have always felt that whatever environment exists,
they should be afforded the freedom to optimize it. Whether it is reprogramming
an existing operating system or establishing their own set of behavioral
protocols, it is the freedom that they seek to define their own desirable
environment. </P>

<P><B>&quot;All information should be free.&quot; </B></P>

<P>The principle idea is that if you do not know how to obtain the information,
how could you benefit or pose a threat to others who may utilize the same
resources? The primary ideal that all information should be free has landed
many of its advocates in unprecedented litigation. Is it appropriate that
anyone has the right to examine your credit report? Or your E-Mail? Or
your medical history? These ultimately fall into the category of &quot;information&quot;,
by this definition. </P>

<P><B>&quot;Mistrust Authority -- Promote Decentralization.&quot; </B></P>

<P>This is an ethical factor that is still adhered to rather strictly by
hacker purists. In its beginnings, authority figures in the computer community
were inept or simply did not exist. Most could not afford them the computing
freedom they demanded. This problem still exists and unfortunately the
boundary between what constitutes an acceptable computer ethic and activities
that pose a threat to the computer community is more complex than ever.
We have as many or more inept system administrators in the present day
computer network world. </P>

<P><B>&quot;Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria
such as degrees, age, race or position.&quot; </B></P>

<P>An ethic that is perhaps one of the least threatening to other computer
enthusiasts. It is also one of the most respectable values, considering
what the true sense of hacking really is. </P>

<P><B>&quot;You can create art and beauty on a computer.&quot; </B></P>

<P>The early hackers spent substantial resources and time developing fractals
and other display-specific tricks that were indicative of that era. Development
and extensive enhancements of the SPACE WAR program on the early PDPs at
MIT is legendary. </P>

<P>In the simplest sense, the early computer pioneers were rebels in their
own right -- they wanted no one to restrict their ability to get computer
time or make necessary enhancements or adjustments to the system as they
saw fit. Such is our computer world today, to many who take it very seriously.
However, one key factor has been added -- to avoid inflicting damage. In
the strictest interpretation, it correlates to never intentionally damaging
any information that you access. Or propagating damaging programs into
an unsuspecting public domain. A true hacker is someone who thirsts for
knowledge and wishes to make the information available to others who may
not have the good fortune or skill to acquire it otherwise. </P>

<P>Without getting too in-depth into the development and progress of computers
in our environment, we should address what we have experienced in the past
few years with computer viruses and how they have affected our domain.
The decision that remains concerns our code of ethical and moral computer
conduct. </P>

<P><B>COMPUTER ETHICS AND COMPUTER VIRUSES </B></P>

<P>What impact did computer viruses have on ethics in the computer community?
With the explosion of the number of computer viruses, this remains an unanswered
question. In the years since viruses first appeared in the MS/PC-DOS computing
environment, they have grown in both numbers and complexity at an alarming
rate. They have become not only commonplace, but also extremely difficult
to defend against. The virus creators have designed, compiled and released
encrypting viruses, multipartite viruses, stealth viruses and viruses employing
encryption techniques so bizarre that it warrants immediate concern. The
scope of the problem has grown to the point where computer users are desperate
for answers to their questions and solutions to the computer virus dilemma.
</P>

<P>The computer ethics situation at present is as distorted and convoluted
as it could have ever been imagined. Some of the more disturbing activities
in the virus information channels recently, have been irresponsible postings
of source code, DEBUG scripts of live viruses and overall disregard of
computer ethics and morals. To complicate matters, virus exchange BBSs
have cropped up where viruses and virus source code are freely exchanged.
The people who engage in these activities have successfully shown their
disregard for the remainder of the computing public. Perhaps these individuals
have not given ample thought to the consequences of their actions. By allowing
live computer viruses to freely filter into the public domain, they are
ultimately responsible for any damage inflicted, either directly or indirectly,
due to their negligence or disregard. Perhaps they do not care. In any
event, it is time for us to reclaim control of our computing environment
and establish a set of guidelines that define what is unacceptable behavior.
We should be able to gate the damaging material that is passed amongst
those who effectively abuse the privilege. A privilege, mind you, not a
right. </P>

<P><B>INHERENT RIGHTS vs. ACQUIRED PRIVILEGES </B></P>

<P>There has evolved the question of where do we draw the line between
the free exchange of ideals and information and disallowing damaging code
to be freely exchanged to all requesters? Although the line has not been
defined, several important factors should be considered. When considering
each alternative, the &quot;greater good&quot; syndrome consistently comes
into play. And a myriad of questions surface with its contemplation. Who
makes these &quot;greater good&quot; decisions, anyway? Is this a case
of 1st Amendment rights versus control of damaging or potentially damaging
information or code? Can legislation be enacted to absolve system administrators
and forum moderators of the burden of making ethical and morality decisions
and being inundated with charges of inhibiting someone else's rights? </P>

<P>These questions are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Each question
has it's validity and weaknesses. To use particular examples, unfortunate
instances of computer virus source code, and even more damaging -- DEBUG
scripts, readily able to be reassembled by even the most neophyte computer
user, have been posted in the FidoNet public virus conference forums, and
even more questionable practices have been witnessed on other publicly
accessible networks. To those who posted them, it may have been an innocent
act on their part to make the information available to others in a public
forum. For whatever reason, posting of code that has the ability to replicate
(or even destroy) on an unsuspecting user's system is, in my opinion, inherently
wrong. And the assistance in propagating it is equally guilty. Many of
the virus authors and couriers hold the belief that what they dabble and
propagate is completely legal and beneficial. Actually, they are only half
right. There are currently no laws that specifically target computer virus
distribution. The legislation that does exist, dates back to the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act (1986) and is rather outdated. The CFAA does not address
certain topics that have become an issue in recent years. </P>

<P>Several bills have been introduced into legislation that would, indeed,
have made it a criminal offense to propagate computer viruses in a fashion
that would endanger the public. In a recent attempt to enhance the existing
law, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Ver.) spearheaded an effort to enact an addendum
to the existing CFAA [2]. Language contained within the bill (S 1322) specifically
addressed computer abusers; those which intentionally introduce computer
viruses or damaging code to systems. The proposed law would have provided
an avenue to prosecute those who never gained access to a remote system,
in the conventional sense. Misdemeanors would have been punishable by up
to one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. Felonies would carry a maximum
fine of $250,000 and a prison term of up to five years. The bill was killed
and never made it into law. </P>

<P>Are there any measures in place to effectively deal with the distribution
of potentially damaging information? Yes and no. Computer professionals
around the world have independently established casual associations of
virus researchers when it became apparent that the virus problem was something
that would not resolve itself. More recently, formal and professional organizations
have been formed that deal specifically with computer virus research, user
education and antivirus product development. This cannot resolve the overall
problem. </P>

<P><B>MAKING THE TOUGH DECISIONS </B></P>

<P>Many view virus creators as angst-ridden computer users with an axe
to grind. Many see them as rebellious teenagers wishing to leave their
graffiti on whatever computer resources they can access. Whatever the reason,
a set of moral and ethical standards need to be created that dictate what
is unacceptable behavior in the computer community. Underground computer
virus creation groups have avowed to continue writing and distributing
viruses with disregard. Is this a protected activity under the First Amendment?
Or is it just reckless endangerment to the computer community at large?
The &quot;greater good&quot; rationale dictates making every effort on
our part to protect unsuspecting computer users and formulate a logical
method for stemming the flow of damaging code into the public domain. If
we sit idly by, the problem will only worsen. We may eventually find ourselves
the victims of our own procrastination. </P>
