<p> <b><font color="#004080"><br>
  Tell me a little about yourself as a person, hobbies/music etc etc? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a person, hmm.. I hate it when being told what to do, that's why I can't&nbsp; 
    stand things like religion or the law. My main hobby is listening to music;&nbsp; 
    bands like Slayer, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Carcass, Altar, 
    Cryptopsy, Mortician, Nile, Napalm Death, and lotsa others. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Where you get your handle? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the movie Terminator 2 there's this terminator T-1000 going around killing 
    people and stuff, so I just added a K and here I am :) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We always used to have an Apple ][ around on which I played games such as 
    Frogger and Space Invaders, this was in the 80's.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus 
  scene? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I started learning assembler in the beginning of '95 when I found a copy&nbsp;of 
    Ralph Burger's book &quot;Computerviruses&quot;. The neighbourhood has ph33red 
    me ever since :P </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Do your family/friends know about your virus 
  activities? What do they think about it? Do you care of their opinion? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>They know I like virii, that's about all.. they certainly do not know my 
    handle.. Virii are considered politically incorrect so they don't like it.&nbsp; 
    I can't even get near a computer without getting accused of having trashed 
    it with a virus, which is getting fuck-annoying. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you use? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For low-level stuff I always use DOS Assembler, or Win32 Assembler, depending 
    on the platform. For DOS screen applications I always use Borland Pascal, 
    as I don't have a DOS C++ compiler with the timer bug fixed :P For Windoze 
    it's always C++. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Where do you live and how is the situation 
  of the virus scene in your land? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was born and raised in Holland, country of drugz n' hookerz.. There's not 
    really a scene anymore here a la <a href="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">TridenT</a>, 
    but there's some VX'ers from here. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">First your virus? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My first virus? MBS/BS/EXE, full stealth, variable encrypted in boot, files, 
    and memory, and way more, fuck, this really was a mother.. I added every possible 
    feature I could think of. Ofcourse it was extremely badly written, but hey, 
    it was my first virus, and I had absolutely no sources to learn from. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How many and which viriis did you write? Which 
  do you like best? Why? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I wrote heaps of 'em, but many never got finished.. Some are: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>-Gwar &amp; Messev: Gwar was a full stealth variable encrypted bootvirus 
      that Messev, a full stealth variable encrypted COM/EXE virus would drop. 
      This 'package' was inspired by AntiTel/Kampana. </p>
    <p>-Pinhead: MBS/BS/COM/EXE full stealth. This was more like a coding exercise 
      (the thing was under a K). Actually, nowadays I <br>
      can do alot more with those same 1000 bytes.. </p>
    <p>-Chloride: MBS/BS/EXE-header, full stealth, I wanted to code a small virus 
      that was able to propagate very quickly and unnoticed.</p>
    <p>-Widowmaker: MBS/BS/COM/EXE slow polymorphics, full stealth, pretty much 
      every feature I could think of at the time. </p>
    <p>-Candyman: Inspired by Mirror.4130, makes it seem all COM/EXE files are 
      infected with it by using the reverse of redirection stealth. </p>
    <p>-Soulfly: Full stealth COM/EXE variable encrypting. I needed a stable DOS 
      virus that would work in 9x DOS boxes aswell. </p>
    <p>-HLLP.Deftones: A stupid 'resident' prepending DOS EXE infector, this was 
      only written to demonstrate how to infect in Win32 using a new technique 
      (the one Win32.PrettyPark now is using). </p>
    <p>-Total Chaos: MBS/BS full stealth, variable encrypted, stealths at hardware 
      level using INT 76h, a la Strange. And it's also a real bitch to remove 
      from infected systems. </p>
    <p>-Win32.Krized: PE 9x/NT global resident, polymorphic. My latest virus written 
      for spreading purposes. </p>
    <p>-Win95.Altar: A dumb VxD PE infector, only written to get aqainted with 
      32-bit VxD's. I consider VxD's to be obsolete anyways. </p>
    <p>-Carcass: EXE full stealth, this one hides in the BIOS and patches the 
      DOS kernel in both DOS and Windoze with a JMP_Virus_ISR.</p>
    <p>-Win32.NetWorm: A simple worm that infects Internet hosts running NetBus 
      servers. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Of these I like Win32.Krized the most, as it's very stable, and not too badly 
    written. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viriis? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Depends, sometimes I pick a name I find sound funny, or scary, or cool, shocking, 
    controversial, etc.. Anyways, at the end it's CARO that names your virus so 
    nowadays I usually don't even bother putting a name in. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How do you spread your viriis? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Normally via Usenet and spreaders. Spreading (if you wanna do it good) takes 
    as much, if not more, effort than actually writing the bitch. Unfortunately 
    lately I haven't been that good at spreading at all :( </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Do you prefer a specific type of viriis? Which 
  virus(es) do you like best? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I like 'super-virii', such as Natas and Hare. Win95.SK is aswell a real masterpiece, 
    seldom I see code of such high quality... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">What E-zine you most of all like? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There's no zine I really *like*, but I can dig.. umm.. nah, <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a> 
    started to get bloated in <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">issue #3</a>, and especially 
    in #4. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Which AV product do you like best and why? 
  Which do you piss off most? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I don't really use any AV's.. If you don't run strange cracks or jpg2exe'd 
    pr0n pictures then you don't need to ph33r virii anyways.. </p>
  <p>When I need to help someone else out tho, It's always F-Prot, it detects 
    alot of virii, and I especially like its exact identification.. (even tho 
    it often doesn't seem to be as exact as it claims to be). </p>
  <p>The AV that annoys me the most would be McAfee's, mainly because it's the 
    most overrated AV ever. The average Joe assumes it's a good scanner, which, 
    it is not (why am I caring about this while being on this side of the fence? 
    oh well..). </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">What viruswriting you most of all respect? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What viruswriter? The ones that write em for spreading purposes instead of 
    just to increase their ego by publishing em in zines.. My favourite authors 
    are Priest, Dark Avenger, Demon Emperor, and Neurobasher. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">What do you think about virus generators? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Great concept, now everyone can create it's own nukes without even having 
    to know a single line of assembler. However, if you use one and call yourself 
    a coder, you're drop dead lame. Of all generators, <a href="creatrs2.htm#NRLG">NRLG</a> 
    seemed the best, then again I haven't looked at that many. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">What do you think about poly engines? Which 
  do you like best? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>People are cranking-out poly engines like maniacs, just so Cicatrix can shove 
    yet another 3 letter acronym on his <a href="enginmen.htm">Engine list</a>.. 
    But do they really serve a purpose nowadays? I think not.. </p>
  <p>Anyways, from the old engines, <a href="engine1.htm#DAME">DAME</a> was very 
    good, and the engine of Natas aswell, <a href="engine2.htm#TPE">TPE</a>'s 
    decryptors are very variable, and I liked the idea of <a href="engine2.htm#SMEG">SMEG</a>; 
    using tables to generate complex garbage. Oh, and the concept of register 
    tracking introduced by Uruguay was also quite smashing :).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">What do you think about destructive viruses? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virii were originally created to punish the user (see Brain), so I don't 
    really see a reason why I should break the tradition. Also, who's gonna give 
    a fuck if they're infected with a harmless virus, they run Scan over&nbsp; 
    it and it's gone; &quot;*yawn*, caught some stupid virus yesterday, can't 
    even&nbsp; remember it's name&quot;. However I doubt if anyone will ever forget 
    his CIH infection.. Besides, I hate it if the AV would call my virii &quot;silly&quot; 
    like they do with all harmless virii, none of my virii have ever been called 
    silly, if you know what I mean :) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How did <a href="groups1.htm#IR">Immortal Riot</a> 
  start? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>MM and TU wanted to get ph33red by the warez puppies I believe :P Somewhere 
    in '93. However, I didn't join until around 1,5 years ago. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How is it organized? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Absolutely not! I'm the only, sorta active member, there's CaptZer0 but he 
    dun code much. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How release <a href="ezines1.htm#IR">IR e-zine</a> 
  #9? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There's lack of content, we've only got a handful of sources, and I really 
    don't wanna participate in releasing a zine that's full of collaborator stuff. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">How would you consider the perfect virus? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Xtianity could be called the perfect virus, it spreads like wildfire across 
    the globe, it's almost impossible to remove, and destructive by slowly corrupting 
    it's host's mind.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Your plans in the future as coder and in general? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hmm.. I don't see myself as having a future really.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Where can you be reached ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I can be emailed at <a href="mailto:T2000_@hotmail.com">T2000_@hotmail.com</a>, 
    however, every mail even remotely saying &quot;teach me how to write a virus&quot; 
    will be ignored. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Any greets? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No, I don't need to keep my friends by greeting them every 3 lines.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Any final word? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nope. </p>
