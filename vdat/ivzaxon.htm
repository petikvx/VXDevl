<P><font color="#004080"><b>How did you start out in computers? </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, I started on computers when I was 10, 6 years ago. My first PC was 
    486 DX 33 with four megabytes of RAM. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I started in the scene one year ago. My first contact with viruses was when 
    I download a copy of PS-MPC and IVP. Then I started coding runtimes. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would you like 
  to take credit for? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, I have written almost seven viruses for DOS. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I name my viruses with names of songs, books ... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I can code in PAS,ASM,BASIC and some C </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> ASM </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, <a href="groups1.htm#DDT">DDT</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like TBAV, really. The other products aren't so good. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I'm now starting with Win32 coding. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I think that is very possitive, because the 'war' between we and them can 
    increase, releasing better products/viruses, then knowledge of all. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I get my nick from the C64 game ZAXON, because I played with it the C64 
    of my father when I was 5 </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, it's possitive that exist this kind of soft. It can give some people 
    then chance to start in the scene. (I started with PS-MPC) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Macro viruses are funny, but are limited by the language of MS/WORD, version, 
    and a PC can run without WORD, but cannot without OS </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I usually read <a href="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</a>, <a href="ezines1.htm#XINE">iKx</a> 
    and <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</a> ezines, but i like all e-zines. All 
    have something interesting. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I respect all groups, well, <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a> and <a href="groups1.htm#IKX">iKx</a> 
    have very good viruses for Win32 but I try to read the more info possible 
    of any group. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">In the AV world? </font></b></P>

  <p> ThunderByte company. </p>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> CPNE (National Spanish Company of Phreak) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't like to put destructive code in viruses that are going to be in 
    the wild, but if you need it to fuck someone, why not?. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No, the payload of a virus is not relationated with the quality of the virus. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What do you do in 'real' life? </b></font> </P>

  phreaking, warez etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have read some phreak and hack, but now I'm in VX scene. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> There is a great difference between creation and spreading. Creation means 
    that you know how to code a virus. If you release your virus to the wild, 
    this is the illegal action. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I can't think that the perfect virus can be done. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95/98) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't like this OS. I think Linux is better. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Don't hesitate and go code, if it seems to be difficult, don't worry and 
    continue, and don't hesitate to ask something in IRC. </p>
