<H3><U>VIRUS HOAXES</U></H3>

<P>In the old days only bearded techies with sandals were on the Internet.
They were heavily into computers, they understood how computers worked
(they had to in order to get on the net in the first place) - in a nutshell
they were academic types. </P>

<P>But times have changed. Today &quot;the information superhighway&quot;
has caught the public’s imagination, and Joe Public can’t go anywhere without
seeing magazines blaring on about the importance of being &quot;wired&quot;
and how they’re not anyone in the nineties if they’ve not got a webpage.
</P>

<P>And today the guys with the beards and sandals are in the minority –
becoming vastly outnumbered by the masses on America OnLine, CompuServe,
MSN, and other easy-to-use service providers. Not all these service providers
necessarily offer the same abilities as a raw direct connection to the
net, but that doesn’t matter to the masses. They want something that’s
pretty, and simple to navigate about with using a mouse, and - most vitally
- gives them email. </P>

<P>With email they can make friends, and keep in touch with people they
would never dream of telephoning or writing a letter to. It’s quick and
simple and doesn’t require walking down the road to a post box. </P>

<P>Furthermore if someone emails you a funny joke you can forward it to
all your friends. Very little effort and everyone thinks you’re the funniest
chap around.. and no chance of you fluffing the punch line. </P>

<P>Another great thing about the internet is it can give people a sense
of community. Anyone who has dropped into a newsgroup like alt.comp.virus
soon finds out that it’s the equivalent of meeting friends down the pub.
Although people are always quick to assist those who have a virus problem,
they’re also there to chat about anything and everything. </P>

<P>I have an account with an online conferencing system. Its Internet connection
is pretty lousy, its newsfeed is patchy, but the reason why I and thousands
of others choose to stay with it is because it’s &quot;comfortable&quot;,
it’s a community, it’s where our friends hang out. </P>

<P>As well as sharing jokes with friends to keep them amused, we’re also
concerned about their welfare. And if we hear about a problem it’s natural
to warn our friends as well. </P>

<P>It is this concern for fellow computer users which has ignited hoaxes
into a significant problem. </P>

<P><HR><p></P>

<P>The "Mother" of all hoaxes has to be &quot;Good Times&quot;:</P>

<P><A NAME="good"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Good Times</B> </FONT></P>

<P>There are a number of different versions of Good Times, some are more
elaborate than others. Here’s an example Good Times warning: </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>Here is some important information. Beware of a file
called Goodtimes.</FONT> 
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there.There
is a virus on America Online being sent by E-Mail. If you get anything
called &quot;Good Times&quot;, DON'T read it or download it. It is a virus
that will erase your hard drive. Forward this to all your friends. It may
help them a lot.</FONT></P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Messages similar to the one above began to be spread around the net
and the internal mail systems of corporate companies in 1994. It has propagated
itself extremely well, and media organizations have not helped the problem
by on occasion printing the hoax as fact (and thus adding even more credibility
to the story). </P>

<P>Those of us with knowledge of how viruses can and cannot work knew instantly
that Good Times was a hoax, but the average user who knows little about
computers let alone viruses could easily believe the message. This belief
was further encouraged when another version of the hoax claimed that the
US FCC (Federal Communications Commission) had issued a warning about the
&quot;virus&quot;. The FCC were quick to debunk this but of course few
people took time to check. </P>

<P>After it’s initial burst in 1994, Good Times went quiet for a while.
Many people breathed a sigh of relief hoping we had seen the last of it.
But then it burst into life again - if anything even more brightly than
before. </P>

<P>The theory is that every so often a hoax will &quot;get lucky&quot;
again. Just like a virus can &quot;get lucky&quot; by being accidentally
shipped with commercial software, or being made available on a popular
website, so a hoax can become lucky if some (albeit well-intentioned) individual
or company receives the hoax warning and decides to &quot;tell all their
friends&quot;. </P>

<P>This behaviour has also been seen in many of the other hoaxes discussed
in this paper. </P>

<P>In summary (I feel I have to say this every time): Good Times is a hoax,
not a real virus. </P>

<A NAME="irina"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Irina</B> </FONT><p></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="IMAGE1.GIF" HEIGHT=56 WIDTH=90> </P></CENTER>

<P>I first heard of Irina on the morning of September 20<SUP>th</SUP> 1996.
It was the second morning of the Virus Bulletin conference in Brighton,
England, and I received a message to call Robert Uhlig of The Daily Telegraph
about a brand new virus called &quot;Irina&quot;. </P>

<P>Uhlig asked me if we detected the virus and I responded that the name
was unfamiliar to me (maybe it was a new virus which another anti-virus
company had named?) and asked him for more information. </P>

<P>It transpired that Robert Uhlig had received a mail from a Professor
Edward Prideaux at the College of Slavonic Studies warning of the new virus.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>A computer virus is being sent across the Internet. If
you receive an e-mail message with the subject line &quot;Irina&quot;,
DO NOT read the message. DELETE it immediately. Some miscreant is sending
people and files under the title &quot;Irina&quot;. If you receive this
mail or file, do not download it. It has a virus that rewrites your hard
drive, obliterating anything on it. Please surf carefully and forward this
mail to anyone you care about.</FONT> </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>As Uhlig began to describe what the virus was supposed to do it became
obvious that it was a hoax. After a little investigation the whole story
then began to emerge.. </P>

<P>The Irina hoax was a &quot;marketing ploy&quot; by a UK publisher, Penguin
Books, to promote a new book of theirs. Guy Gadney, the former head of
electronic publishing at Penguin, sent out a &quot;virus alert&quot; in
an attempt to stir up interest in their new book. Unfortunately the alert
did not make clear that it was a hoax and not supposed to be taken seriously.
</P>

<P>The alert claimed to be from a Professor Edward Prideaux at the College
of Slavonic Studies in London. The College of Slavonic Studies does not
exist, but London's School of Slavonic and East European Studies was reportedly
inundated with calls to the fictitious Professor Prideaux. </P>

<P>Although Gadney sent out a second letter explaining that the first was
a hoax, it has done little to stop the spread of the alert, and it is now
beyond anyone's control. </P>

<P>To promote &quot;Irina&quot; Penguin Books targeted the science fiction
community and a significant number of science fiction periodicals and writers
(many of whom had an internet connection) received the original version
of the hoax. </P>

<P>The United Kingdom science fiction magazine Ansible was one of the publications
to pick up on the story, and they did their best to limit the spread of
the panic in Issue 111 (reprinted with permission from the editor of Ansible
magazine): </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD>&quot;The hoax flyer was traceable, through characteristic typos in
address labels, to the Penguin sf review mailing list! Several people alerted
Penguin to the abuse of their database ... only to be gobsmacked by flyer
#2, this time on Penguin notepaper, which coyly began: 
<P><I>`You may have received a letter from a Professor Edward Prideaux
recently falsely warning of a virus called &quot;Irina&quot;. Please note
that &quot;Irina&quot; _is not a virus_, and the views of Prof. Prideaux
are not those of Penguin Books. &quot;Irina&quot; is the title of Penguin
Books' ground-breaking interactive novel ... put together by the science
fiction author, Stephen Baxter, by Guy Gadney, former Head of Electronic
Publishing at Penguin, and Hugh Barnes, an Executive Editor at Penguin.'
</I></P>

<P>That is, Penguin had started a virus scare (which of course went round
the world by e-mail in mere hours) simply to promote the bloody book. Steve
Baxter hastened to proclaim his innocence: </P>

<P><I>`I did know they were planning a teaser-type PR campaign, but....'</I>
</P>

<P>Various net and virus pundits pissed on Penguin from a great height;
the Telegraph (23 Sept) quoted Guy Gadney as blandly saying, </P>

<P><I>`It is very unfortunate that we have created a scare -- it was not
our intention.' </I></P>

<P>Ansible wondered whether what seemed daft here would pass unremarked
in the hurly-burly of New York publishing ... but Patrick Nielsen Hayden
of Tor assured me, </P>

<P><I>`If my publicity people had done that, I'd hang them out to dry,
and you may quote me to the fine people at Penguin UK. [] What's most offensive
is their obvious belief that their need to publicize Baxter's book is more
important than the rules of courtesy and common sense followed by the internet's
little people. I'm sure I could get a lot of publicity by towing a billboard
for my books down the wrong side of Fifth Avenue at seventy-five miles
an hour, too, but it wouldn't make it a smart thing to do.' </I></P>

<P>Now Guy Gadney explains: </P>

<P><I>`The intention of the release was to convey the tone and the conspiratorial
nature both of the plot of the novel, and of some areas of the Internet
itself.' </I></P>

<P>(Thus, for example, a book about political assassination might similarly
have been promoted by mailing death threats to cabinet ministers ... plenty
of publicity there.) </P>

<P><I>`Of course, we were keen that the information should be kept by the
journalists and not sent out electronically.' </I></P>

<P>(Disingenuous. To quote the first flyer: <I>`Please be careful and forward
this mail to anyone you care about ... Alert your friends and local system
users.'</I> Now, boys and girls, when people are urgently told to warn
their e-mail contacts, what route are they most likely to use?) </P>

<P><I>`To this end, the release was sent in hard copy by post to named
individuals to avoid any wider dissemination.' </I></P>

<P>(I'm certainly glad it didn't go to any of that notoriously indiscreet
subset of humanity which lacks names. Sending scary information to journalists
is of course a well-known way <I>`to avoid any wider dissemination'</I>.)
</P>

<P><I>`We also took steps to make sure that neither Professor Prideaux
nor the College of Slavonic Studies exist outside the novel itself.' </I></P>

<P>(It's good to know that some people have the integrity to make Really
Sure they're signing a false name.) </P>

<P><I>`As regards the project itself, Stephen and I have been working together
to produce what we believe is a true and seamless joining of technology
and fictional story-telling. Based around the web sites of the key characters
rather than an episodic, page-turning exercise, Irina is a ground-breaking
project both for Stephen and Penguin. [] I am sorry about any misunderstanding
and hope that you will find Irina interesting.' </I></P>

<P>(Er, what misunderstanding? A straightforward <I>`Sorry we acted like
utter loons'</I> would have been more to the point, but let it pass....)

<P>Ansible wrote again about the Irina fiasco in their next edition, where
they revealed that Penguin Books were taking an interesting approach to
the problem. </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD>MAD PENGUIN DISEASE. 
<P>Because I am a kindly soul, I don't really want to go on and on at Penguin
for their lame-brained publicity stunt of a computer virus hoax. However
... the lie still continues to propagate around the net, and Penguin's
Guy Gadney has developed a damage-control response which irritatingly glosses
over little matters like culpability: </P>

<P><I>`There is an Interactive Novel which you can access from the Penguin
Books homepage at www.penguin.co.uk called &quot;Irina&quot; after the
main character Irina Zotova. This has conflicted with reports of a virus
called Irina which does not exist and the Professor Edward Prideaux mentioned
is a character in the story. The virus rumour has been checked by experts
in the UK and it has been confirmed that there is currently no &quot;Irina&quot;
virus to guard against and that an email erroneously circulated to a mailing
list was at the root of this rumour.' </I></P>

<P>Admiring this wholehearted apology, this eager readiness to shoulder
the blame, one is compelled to the realization that Guy Gadney is wasted
in publishing and should move to a career in politics. As soon as possible.
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<CENTER><P><B>clipping from Ansible Issue 112 </B></P></CENTER>

<P>At the time it was suggested that Penguin Books should provide a statement
on their website, reassuring computer users that the Irina virus was a
hoax, but to my knowledge nothing appeared. Furthermore I was bombarded
with requests for Guy Gadney’s email address (I do have it, but I declined
all requests in a rare display of mercy) from system administrators who
wanted to forward their panicking users directly to him. </P>

<P>It seems I wasn’t alone in receiving requests for details on how to
have Gadney’s head on a silver plate, as in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> December
1996 edition of PC Week (UK Edition) one reader wrote in: </P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=20 >
<TR>
<TD>Getting back at Penguin 
<P>Thank you for revealing Penguin Books’ cruel Irina hoax (PC Week 26
November) which has caused us a lot of problems with concerned users. </P>

<P>Why don’t you publish the Email address of the person responsible or
of the editor-in-chief? We could then forward every single mail we’ve received
from our panicked users over the past few weeks </P>

<P>Mat Ellis </P>

<P>Mat.Ellis@pepsicofoodinstl.sprint.com </P>

<P><I>Editor replies: </I></P>

<P><I>We have received a letter from Penguin’s publicity director apologizing
(sic) for the concern its spoof caused. </I></P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<CENTER><P><B>clipping from PC Week (UK), December 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 1996
</B></P></CENTER>

<P>I am sure that Penguin Books are extremely embarrassed by the whole
incident, and will be vary wary of conducting a similar spoof to promote
a new publication in the future. Other companies should observe Penguin’s
discomfort and avoid engaging in similar publicity stunts. </P>

<P>None of this, of course, stops the hoax from spreading and unfortunately,
many companies and individuals continue to fall for this hoax. Ironically
one victim was the anti-virus company McAfee whose Moscow office deemed
the hoax genuine (!) and faxed out a warning about the &quot;virus&quot;
alongside a genuine alert about Bandung to its customers on October 31<SUP>st</SUP>
1996: </P>

<P>It could be argued that in this way Irina &quot;got lucky&quot;. By
sneaking into a message from an anti-virus company it gained the ultimate
credibility. </P>

<P>In summary (sorry if this is getting tedious.. but we need to get the
message across): Irina is a hoax, not a real virus. <BR>

<HR><BR>
<A NAME="dee"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Deeyenda</B> </FONT><p></P>

<P>In many ways Deeyenda is similar to the Good Times hoax. The warning
shares similarities (even dragging the FCC in again) and claims to spread
in the same way (by reading a message with a particular subject line).
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD>VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. PLEASE READ! There is a computer virus
that is being sent across the internet. If you receive an email message
with the subject line &quot;Deeyenda&quot;, DO NOT read the message. DELETE
it immediately! If you run across anything like this DON'T DOWNLOAD THE
FILE! It has a virus that rewrites your hard drive, obliterating anything
on it. Please be careful and forward this message to anyone who you believe
this may affect. The message below gives additional information. 
<P>FCC WARNING!!!!! -----DEEYENDA PLAGUES INTERNET The Internet community
has again been plagued by another computer virus. This message is being
spread throughout the Internet, including USENET posting, EMAIL, and other
Internet activities. The reason for all the attention is because of the
nature of this virus and the potential security risk it makes. Instead
of a destructive Trojan virus (like most viruses!), this virus referred
to as Deeyenda Maddick, performs a comprehensive search on your computer,
looking for valuable information such as email and login passwords, credit
cards, personal inf., etc. </P>

<P>The Deeyenda virus also has the capability to stay memory resident while
running a host of applications and operation systems, such as Windows 3.11
and Windows 95. What this means to Internet users is that when a login
and Password are sent to the server, this virus can copy this information
and SEND IT OUT TO AN UNKNOWN ADDRESS (varies). The reason for this warning
is because the Deeyenda virus is virtually undetectable. Once attacked,
your computer will be unsecure. Although it can attack any O/S, this virus
is most likely to attack those viewing Java enhanced Web Pages (Netscape
2.0+ and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0+ which are running under Windows
95). Researchers at Princeton University have found this virus on a number
of World Wide Web pages and fear its spread. </P>

<P>Please pass this on, for we must alert the general public of the security
risks. </P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>It was pointed out to me sometime after I first encountered the Deeyenda
hoax that &quot;Deeyenda Maddick&quot; sounds phonetically like &quot;The
end of my dick&quot;. I guess that I was not alone in failing to spot that,
and maybe that is once again an effect of communicating via email. If I
was discussing this email message face-to-face with someone then the crude
joke in the name would have become apparent. Electronic discussion, however,
fails to make it obvious. </P>

<P>In summary: Deeyenda is a hoax, not a real virus. <BR>

<HR><BR>
<A NAME="pen"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>PenPal Greetings</B> </FONT><p></P>

<P>In many ways PenPal Greetings is similar to &quot;Good Times&quot;:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 >
<TR>
<TD>If anyone receives mail entitled: PENPAL GREETINGS! please delete it
WITHOUT reading it. Below is a little explanation of the message, and what
it would do to your PC if you were to read the message: 
<P>This is a warning for all internet users - there is a dangerous virus
propagating across the internet through an e-mail message entitled &quot;PENPAL
GREETINGS!&quot;. DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY MESSAGE ENTITLED &quot;PENPAL GREETINGS!&quot;
</P>

<P>This message appears to be a friendly letter asking you if you are interested
in a penpal, but by the time you read this letter, it is too late. The
&quot;trojan horse&quot; virus will have already infected the boot sector
of your hard drive, destroying all of the data present. It is a self-replicating
virus, and once the message is read, it will AUTOMATICALLY forward itself
to anyone who's e-mail address is present in YOUR mailbox! This virus will
DESTROY your hard drive, and holds the potential to DESTROY the hard drive
of anyone whose mail is in your inbox, and who's mail is in their inbox,
and so on. </P>

<P>If this virus remains unchecked, it has the potential to do a great
deal of DAMAGE to computer networks worldwide!!!! </P>

<P>Please, delete the message entitled &quot;PENPAL GREETINGS!&quot; as
soon as you see it! And pass this message along to all of your friends
and relatives, and the other readers of the newsgroups and mailing lists
which you are on, so that they are not hurt by this dangerous virus!!!!
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The sad truth is that despite users having been barraged with the Good
Times hoax, and the Deeyenda hoax not everyone was aware that they had
been the victim of a hoax. Furthermore there were still many more users
who hadn’t received a similar warning in the past. So, despite the similarities
in this hoax to previous examples the PenPal Greetings hoax has also managed
to spread far and wide. </P>

<P>In summary: PenPal Greetings is a hoax, not a real virus. <BR>

<HR><BR>
<A NAME="ghost"></A><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Ghost</B> </FONT><p></P>

<P>Ghost is not a virus. But it’s also not quite the same as the e-mail
chain letter hoaxes such as Good Times and Deeyenda. </P>

<P>Ghost is an innocent program which has received excessive publicity
online after being falsely accused of containing malicious code. Ghost
is a fun Windows program designed to entertain idle users in a similar
vein to a screensaver. A graveyard is displayed and ghosts fly around the
window in front of a full moon. On Friday the 13th, the title bar changes
to 'Happy Friday the 13th!' and the ghosts start flying around the Windows
desktop. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="IMAGE3.GIF" HEIGHT=233 WIDTH=197> </P></CENTER>

<P>According to reports on McAfee’s CompuServe forum a version of their
anti-virus product identified the program as being infected with the &quot;GHOST
virus&quot;. For a while confusion reigned as all other anti-virus products
declared the file to be clean, and anti-virus researchers were unable to
find anything suspicious in the file. </P>

<P>McAfee later confirmed that the file was indeed clean and did not perform
any malicious activity. It has been suggested that it was possible that
McAfee’s intention was to label the file as a known ‘joke’ program to reassure
those who felt it was a virus, and that’s why detection for the program
was added to their database. Some anti-virus programs do detect common
‘joke’ programs (such as BONK) to reassure users who may think they are
suspect. </P>

<P>All samples seen so far by anti-virus developers have proven to be benign.
However, please be aware that although these are not viruses, the programs
themselves could be infected in the future. <BR>

<TR>
<TD>There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. If
you receive an e-mail message with the subject line &quot;Free Money,&quot;

<P>Once a computer is infected, it will be TOO LATE. Your computer will
begin to emit a vile ODOR. Then it will secrete a foul, milky DISCHARGE.
Verily, it shall SCREECH with the tortured, monitor-shattering SCREAM of
1,000 hell-scorched souls, drawing unwanted attention to your cubicle from
co-workers and supervisors alike. After violently ripping itself from the

into the night, HOWLING like a BANSHEE. Once free, it will spend the rest
of its days CRUSHING household PETS and MOCKING the POPE. </P>

</TABLE>

<P>It’s hard to believe that such a sensational payload like this can be
believable. But this hoax still spreads and some users are still concerned
and contact their technical support department. In this way the message
is still a troublesome nuisance. </P>

<P>In summary: Free Money is a hoax, not a real virus.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>AOL4FREE is a hoax that was born out of a program called AOL for

it would convince the AOL payment system that you were in a free area so
would not have to pay for any on-line time. Recently though, the following
messages have started appearing in many of the newsgroups.<p></P>

<P>THIS WAS SENT TO ME BY TWO PEOPLE. PLEASE BEWARE_</P>

<P><I>Anyone who receives this must send it to as many people as you can.
It is essential that this problem be reconciled as soon as possible. A
few hours ago, I opened an E-mail that had the subject heading of aol4free.com.
Within seconds of opening it, a window appeared and began to display my
files that were being deleted. I immediately shut down my computer, but
it was too late. This virus wiped me out. It ate the Anti-Virus Software
that comes with the Windows '95 Program along with F-Prot AVS. Neither
was able to detect it. Please be careful and send this to as many people
as possible, so maybe this new virus can be eliminated.</I></P>

<TD>The latest breaking news on the GOODTIMES virus. 
<P>It turns out that this so-called hoax virus is very dangerous after
all. Goodtimes will re-write your hard drive. Not only that, it will scramble
any disks that are even close to your computer. It will recalibrate your
refrigerator's coolness setting so all your ice cream goes melty. It will
demagnetize the strips on all your credit cards, screw up the tracking
on your television and use subspace field harmonics to scratch any CDs
you try to play. </P>

<P>It will give your ex-girlfriend your new phone number. It will mix Kool-aid
into your fishtank. It will drink all your beer and leave dirty socks on
the coffee table when company comes over. It will put a dead kitten in
the back pocket of your good suit pants and hide your car keys when you
are late for work. </P>

<P>Goodtimes will make you fall in love with a penguin. It will give you
nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour sugar in your gas tank and
shave off both your eyebrows while dating your girlfriend behind your back
and billing the dinner and hotel room to your Discover card. </P>

<P>It will seduce your grandmother. It does not matter if she is dead,
such is the power of Goodtimes, it reaches out beyond the grave to sully
those things we hold most dear. </P>

<P>It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't find it.
It will kick your dog. It will leave libidinous messages on your boss's
voice mail in your voice! It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and
terrifying to behold. It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve. </P>

<P>Goodtimes will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the toilet
seat up. It will make a batch of Methanphedime in your bathtub and then
leave bacon cooking on the stove while it goes out to chase gradeschoolers
with your new snowblower. </P>
