<P>I get many requests from people asking what is the most definitive and
complete resource for virus information. Without a second thought, I direct
them to VDAT. For those of you who do not know about VDAT, quite simply,
it is a compilation of virus writing tutorials, interviews, and reviews
of virus utilities and groups. </P>

<P>The creator of VDAT is Cicatrix. Cicatrix describes himself as a regular run-of-the-mill 
  average guy who happens to 'dig' computer viruses. Well, this average guy, is 
  one of the most respected suppliers of virus related material in the world. 
  He not only maintains VDAT, but also a web site, http://www.cyberstation.net/~cicatrix 
  (<font size="-1">closed, now <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Ecicatrix">http://www.xs4all.nl/~cicatrix</a> 
  [CCTX]</font>). No other site on the web has kept so many up-to-date virus collections, 
  magazines, and utilities. Let me stress this point - go to Cicatrix's web site 
  to download the most current virus magazines. (especially <A HREF="ezines1.htm#CODE">Codebreakers 
  Zine</A>). Cicatrix also maintains monthly zipped collections of virii and source 
  code, which is great for building your virus database. </P>

<P>If you are new or old to the virus scene and don't visit Cicatrix's
site often, I highly recommend that you check it out. From his web site,
you can download current versions of VDAT. </P>

<P>In order to shed some light to the mystery of who Cicatrix is, I did
an interview with him. </P>

<P>Enjoy. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So, how did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My first experience must have been around 1983 when I saw some 10-12
year old kid do magic with a computer keyboard. I decided that what a 10-12
year old kid could do I could better so I bought my first computer (Acorn
Electron with a cassette player for storage) and started fooling around
programming simple stuff in BASIC. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you get into the underground scene?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't consider myself underground really, I have nothing to hide (yet).
My first virus encounter must have been the late '80's. I'd often heard
about this magical thing called a computer virus but I had never encountered
one. Having moved to an IBM-compatible computer (8088) I was using quite
a lot of pirated software and I used McAfee as a virus scanner. Then one
day when I decided to scan a diskette which I did not expect to have a
virus (it came from a reputable source) I found the Cascade virus. I used
this virus to get on a BBS with viruses and started downloading after I
got access. With those viruses I got access to other VX BBS's etc.etc.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What groups have you belonged to in the past?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>None. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion on virii and virus writers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Both are pretty interesting, but basically I collect viruses just like
someone who collects stamps. Writers can be just as interesting although
a lot of people that consider themselves virus writers I consider as just
hangers-on. There are some pretty weird personalities out there though
and I haven't met the 'standard' lonely, pathetic teenager yet. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you ever get any hassle or interference
from the law about VDAT or your web site? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, not so far. I don't think what I do is exactly illegal although
some might consider it immoral. People who visit my site do so out of free
will. Just like I say on my site, should stuff start 'heating-up' I'm going
to quit making my collections available through a website. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you first put together VDAT? Why?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Release 1.0 was released August 1995. Here's the intro to that version,
it includes the why: </P>

<P>For years I've been reading .DOC .TXT and .ASC files about the virus
and anti-virus scene. Those files are by now spread out across a lot of
my diskettes and whenever I wanted to read something a second time I knew
I had, I of course couldn't find it and ended up downloading it again.
Finally, I was sick and tired of it and came up with a solution. I combined
everything in a hypertext format which I now keep on my hard drive. The
initial release took me about a month and a half but hey, it's an improvement
and I enjoyed doing it. Anyway, why keep it to myself? Here it is, use
it if you want to, otherwise: trash it!&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you see in the future for virus writers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>As long as there are computers there will be computer viruses, as long
as there are viruses there will be virus authors. It might get more difficult
in the future to write a 'successful' virus but it has been proven several
times already that there are a lot of smart, innovative people that want
to write viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How long will you continue compiling virus
data? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>As long as I enjoy doing it and as long as I have the time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your future plans after school? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Just continue what I did before school, work. The classes I'm doing
are just employer-imposed additional training. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you currently taking any computer classes?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nope, everything I know I taught myself. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your definition of a hacker? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't really have one. Depends on the hacker's background. An 'underground'
hacker tries to get access to a system he doesn't have access to. A 'legit'
hacker is knowledgeable Unix guru without any real 'underground' needs.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your rapport with the AV community?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Almost non-existent. I had a few small e-mail contacts with some. I
guess most consider me VX and don't want anything to do with me. Personally
I consider myself to be sort of middle-of-the-road, I can appreciate arguments
on computer viruses from both sides. I also think there is a basic difference
between making computer viruses and know-how available and the active spreading
of viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you write virii? If so, how many have you
written? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nope, not even with a VCK. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you ever refuse to put something on your
web site or in VDAT? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I regularly do. I determine what is on my site, space is limited
and it has to fit in the subjects I have. VDAT is a matter of accuracy,
I want to be as accurate as possible but if information I get from someone
is inaccurate it is hard to check. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Is anything too malicious? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, destruction for the sake of destruction is unnecessary. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you see Windows 95/98 affecting virus
writing techniques? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The future. Not as hard as some people thought it would be although
most W95 viruses are not as stable and sophisticated as some DOS viruses.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you find the time to put together and
maintain VDAT and your web site? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You tell me, sometimes I don't know how and why I do it. A laptop with
the works helps. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where are you from? What part of the world
are you living in now? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some know my exact nationality but lets stay with Western Europe. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are there any virus groups that you particularly
dislike? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I don't dislike anyone in the VX or AV world. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">On VDAT, you have interviews with AV people.
What is your relationship with and attitude towards the AV community? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Just for the record, a lot of interviews in VDAT were compiled from
several e-zines. All of the AV interviews were. The last couple of months
I've done several interviews myself but all of those were VX. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you encourage beginning virus writers
to join a group? Why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nothing against groups but with some notorious exceptions the 'best'
and most known virus writers started out on their own. This was in the
beginning of the computer virus era though, nowadays being a member of
a group saves a lot of effort to get to a higher level. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Of all the thousands of virii that you have
come across, do you have a few favorites that come to mind? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I 'like' the ones that show a sense of humor. I also 'respect' viruses
that are advanced on a technological level, find new holes in system and
show a original way of thinking. I don't really 'like' the basic overwriting
and/or destructive virus and also viruses created with a well known VCK
like PS-MPC are on the bottom of the list. </P>
</UL>
