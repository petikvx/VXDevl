<p>It was only a few months ago that <a href="groups1.htm#DIF">Jerk1N</a>
brought us the first ever Access macro virus. This was a huge
accomplishment. Jerk1N was able to embarrass Microsoft and blaze
a new trail for macro viruses, he deserves much credit for it.
The idea itself and then making it happen was a great feat. </p>

<p>How prevalent will Access macro viruses become? Will everyone
become &quot;virus shy&quot; every time they open a .mdb file?
Nope. There will never be an Access virus epidemic. </p>

<p>How can I be so sure? First let me tell you my credentials. I
wrote the second Access virus ever, Detox and I wrote the first
ever cross-application macro virus, Cross.Poppy, that infected
both Word 97 and Access 97. It wasn't possible to write code that
would work 100% in both Access and Word so Cross.Poppy basically
*jumped* from application to application. For all intensive
purposes it is a cross-application virus. Now that have I have
told you what I have done with Access macros you should be able
to trust what I am about to tell you. </p>

<p>Access viruses will NEVER become a real problem for many
reasons. The main one is that very few people share Access
databases. Most of the time a database is created, updated and
stored in one location. Very rarely will someone send you an
Access database so even if you had an infected database it would
have almost no chance of finding another mdb to infect. </p>

<p>Another problem is that there is no way for an Access virus to
become resident in a default template. In Word macro viruses
reside in the normal.dot and in Excel macro viruses reside in the
personal.xls (or the startup directory). Becoming resident in a
default template is what has made the Excel and Word macro
viruses so successful. Access has no normal template for a virus
to attach to and it does not load anything from a starup
directory. There are Access database wizards from which new
databases can be generated but these are mde files not mdb's and
mde files are locked. A locked mde can not be infected. It may be
possible to convert a mde to mdb, infect it and then convert it
back but the only method I have seen that *attempts* to do this
1) didn't work correctly 2) was VERY noticeable. </p>

<p>Since there is no way for an Access virus to become resident
it must seek-and-infect new files. This direct action would not
be a problem if it was looking for common files but how many mdb
files do you have on your hd? Not many I assure you - even if you
do use Access. So a *good* Access virus must find something to
infect and that could mean searching the ENTIRE hd. Do you think
you would notice that it took 2 full minutes for your database to
open each time you wanted to use it? Yes I think you would,
unless you were an idiot. </p>

<p>As time passes and the &quot;Access Virus Hysteria&quot;
passes you will see AVP and others add new Access viruses to
their virus lists but I would bet my life you will never see an
Access virus on the wild list Also I am reasonably sure that AV
companies will receive less than a handful of Access virus
reports - and you can bet that most of these will be from the
Access virus authors themselves. </p>

<p>So give up on Access viruses? Sure, unless you just want to
see how it's done for the experience but take it from me you wont
be impressed. An Access virus could be written in as few as 10
lines. It's basically : </p>

<pre>
		Get AutoOpen Control
		Search For *.mdb
		Transfer code if any are found
		Quit</pre>

<p>That's it. It's that easy. Doing it the first virus ever was
the hard part (props to Jerk1N for that!) but there isn't much
else to do with it. Even my Cross.Poppy virus will have a hard
time finding some mdb's to infect. I wrote it only to search the
c:\my documents directory. Why? Because I had no idea where
someone would keep an Access database. I don't use Access, I only
loaded Access to write a virus :-) </p>

<p>Peace, VicodinES </p>

<p><strong>Facts: </strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>AccessiV was the first ever Access macro virus (written
        by Jerk1N) </li>
    <li>Detox was written by me to see if I could do one better. </li>
    <li>I wrote Detox under the name &quot;Sin Code IV&quot; </li>
    <li>Cross.Poppy was the first every cross-application macro
        virus but </li>
    <li>Strange Days by Reptile/29A is the first true Office 97
        macro virus and is a great piece of code! </li>
</ol>
