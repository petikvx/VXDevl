<P>For this <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">second issue of 29A</A>, we decided
to interview <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">Qark</A>, one of the best virus
writers ever (maybe the best?), who left <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
and the scene about one year ago. Albeit his lack of free time, this very
good friend of mine was eventually able to make possible to bring you now
this great oportunity to know him better. </P>

<P>We all miss you, dude. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, Qark... this is the classic first question
of almost every interview... tell me why did you choose your nick </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>When Metabolis and I started out with VLAD we had local scene nicks
that everyone knew, so we had to get new ones. (Obviously meta wasn't always
called meta). When I first jumped into irc for #virus, every nick i picked
was always taken, so I thought to myself &quot;What nick could I possibly
pick that noone will ever use ?&quot;, and picked Qark - because it defies
the laws of English by dropping the 'u'. But why &quot;Qark&quot; out of
all the &quot;Q&quot; words ? I don't know.. I can't think of any other
&quot;Q&quot; words to be honest. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When and with 'what' did you start computing?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I didn't own a computer until after I left highschool. (A few years
back). My first computer was a mighty 8088 XT with 20 Meg hard disk and
EGA monitor :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">And when did you first know about a computer
virus (first experience, with which virus(es), etc)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The first I ever heard about computer viruses was when TZ's X-Fungus
virus infected Suncorp (a local bank) on the radio. The first virus I ever
encountered in the flesh was 1575 (green caterpiller) on someones computer.
I took a copy home so that I could work out how to make a virus of my own
but it was beyond me at the time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In what computer languages can you code? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ASM, PAS, SQL, Modula-2 and some C. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe yourself (phisically, morally... however...
even sexually if you dare) :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Umm White, Male, average height, brown hair, blue-green-hazel (something)
eyes. I'm very conservative morally - viruses are a bit of an anomally
in my personality. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, now about viruses... tell me which ones
have you coded, and/or the ones you like most </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Let me see.. I've written a whole heap of viruses. Father, Mother, Sister,
Brother (Incest family - Very lame) - VLAD#1 </P>

<UL>
<P>Actually mother wasn't too bad. It still stealths everything. </P>
</UL>

<P>VLAD virus, Republic, Meningitis - VLAD#2 </P>

<UL>
<P>Pretty lame still, although my flash bios infector was a nifty idea.
</P>
</UL>

<P>Hemlock, Megastealth - VLAD#3 </P>

<UL>
<P>Both these viruses were pretty cool even if somewhat buggy. </P>
</UL>

<P>Winsurfer, Goodtimes - VLAD#4 </P>

<UL>
<P>Winsurfer was a big breakthrough for Quantum and I so it is one of my
favourite virii. </P>
</UL>

<P>Horsa, Ph33r - VLAD#5 </P>

<UL>
<P>I liked both of these virii. Horsa was one of the hardest things I've
ever written due to the mathematics involved so I like it, and Ph33r is
the first multi-OS (kind of) virus so I liked it too. (Quantum wrote the
memory routines for that one) </P>
</UL>

<P>Gilgamesh, tracevir, 386 virus - VLAD#6 </P>

<UL>
<P>Pretty ordinary viruses, but my VSTE (my file entry point tunneling
engine) was a new concept so I kind of liked it, even if it has been done
better since. </P>
</UL>

<P>Padania, goodbye - VLAD#7 </P>

<UL>
<P>Padania was good. Goodbye sucked. </P>
</UL>

<P>Quantum and I have worked on a couple of Win95 viruses together. Win95.Punch
and one in memory of TZ.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Btw, about VLAD (unavoidable question) :) you
left the group... you said you didn't have the time for doing other things...
explain it better, please... did you get a girlfriend? :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>By &quot;other things&quot; I meant &quot;anything&quot;. Spend your
time vladding and the rest of your life goes to hell. </P>

<P>And I do have a lovely woman who takes up a sizeable chunk of my time
:) luckily for me she likes viruses :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about your personal future projects? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some more win95 viruses are on the cards. </P>

<P>I did the vxd routines in a couple of win95 viruses so I'm still coding
every now and then.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">And more thingies about VLAD... could you tell
me something about its story (who, when, why decided to create it, etc)?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm pretty vague about it, but I think it went like this: Meta read
ir#2 and thought &quot;cool, im gonna start my own virus group and call
it vlad&quot;. At this stage I didn't know him at all. A day later he was
chatting to the sysop of the local warez board about his latest group when
he was put in touch with me. And voila thats how it started. </P>

<P>Meta had his own shareware bbs where he was the good-guy sysop, while
in a secret area was the vlad virus section. There we would swap code for
our latest direct-action virii :) </P>

<P>When we got enough dross ready to produce vlad1 I jumped on the bus
and the train and went out to his place to put it all together. We met
for the first time at the train station. Nothing much happened at his place
apart from the magazine production. The main thing I remember is it being
freezing cold .. we were working on it until the early hours of the morning.
</P>

<P>Somewhere along the track meta met TZ and invited him to our private
vlad conference on his bbs. We'd discuss virii techniques.. </P>

<P>Sometime later we went onto IRC and our story is well known since then..
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which is/are your favourite virus(es)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>RDA.fighter is probably my favourite, followed by starship. </P>

<P>The new virus by Quantum and I is really cool :) coming to a hard disk
near you :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think the perfect virus exists or might
be ever coded? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No.. the whole idea of a perfect virus is stupid I think. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How will the 'viruses of the future' look in
your opinion? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It will be a resident win95/NT infector. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, now let's have a look at the other side...
AVs and AVers. Which is the AV you like most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>AVP is pretty good. Its win95 version really needs a scanning VXD though.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Heh... one question is enough for those niggas
;) now about the virus scene... give me your point of view about it (old
groups, new groups, who's cool, who sucks... you know) :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Firstly, <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> is cool :) </P>

<P><A HREF="groups2.htm#NUKE">Nuke</A>, <A HREF="groups2.htm#RABID">rabid</A>
and <A HREF="groups2.htm#YAM">yam</A> were all lame.. but <A HREF="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">trident</A>
and <A HREF="groups2.htm#PS">p/s</A> were good. </P>

<P><A HREF="groups1.htm#IR">IR</A> were always my favourite group but I
don't like <A HREF="groups1.htm#IRG">IRG</A> much.. </P>

<P><A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A> are way cool :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Finally, just send a greet to someone, say
something, sing, write a poem &lt;g&gt;, pull yourself :)... dunno, whatever
you want. This is your free space :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="misc0006.htm">RIP TZ :(</A> </P>

<P>Greets fly out to Metabolis and Quantumg and all the people I like.
</P>

<P>Also a kiss to a certain girl :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Good luck, Qark... especially with that girl
;) </FONT></B></P>
