<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many viruses did you create? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think I've written about twenty viruses or something like that. I
often writes a new virus when my earlier creations are detected by the
most popular anti-virus programs. Though, sometimes I might just write
a virus to try out a new idea, technique or simply just for destructive
purposes. It can vary how often and how many viruses I write. It's also
a question of time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did they have a destructive payload? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. All my viruses are programmed highly destructive with the intensions
to destroy as many harddrives as possible. Though, sometimes the pay-loads
used is not destructive at all, screen-tricks, music and that kinda things.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did you release them (into public)? If yes,
why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. I do release ‚m all into public such as on BBSes and companies
if that is possible. They'll probably also be send to various FTP sites
on Internet carrying illegal copyrighted software because of the great
number of PC-users there. </P>

<P>I am releasing them because if I wasn't, lotsa time should be wasted
with debugging as well as bug fixing. Who would notice if they worked or
not if they only were printed as source code in our magazine? Noone would.
</P>

<P>It's also interesting to see how far they can travel on their own and
it's a pure pleasure to see reports by infected loosers. That motivates
me to create more. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Can you give examples? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Red Mercury was sent out in several infected files on all major BBSes
in Sweden. We've had quite a few reports concerning Red Mercury because
it will trash the harddrives a bit too often. Bad Attitude, Eternity_II
and DreamWorld has as well been reported, but since they're all complete
undetectable by all anti-virus program, most of the infected users don't
know which virus that blowed their harddrives or infected their files and
cannot report a specific virus. It's for us though easily noticed that
it's our virus that caused them the great damage. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Apart from &quot;just for fun and curiosity/interest
in programming etc.&quot; - did you have any other motives for writing
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>What motivates a virus writer does really vary. It's said that we writes
viruses for either destructive purposes, intellectual challanges or for
publicity reasons. This is ofcause not true. What motivates me to write
viruses is that I just like it. One who're writing viruses will learn to
how to program assembly language and how the computer works in a great
detailed level. That's not bad! But what motivates me most is that I have
met quite a few nice friends, etc. Virus writing is not an anti-social
hobby as most people think it is. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you (I think so) member of a virus-writing/phreaking/hacking
group currently or have you been earlier? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I founded together with a friend called Metal Militia, <A HREF="groups1.htm#IR">Immortal
Riot</A>. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Could you give a description of the group (main
interests, number, age and type of members). </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We're mainly a virus writing group but are also interested in other
topics of the underground-computing, such as hacking and phreaking. Ofcause
we all program - all in our all different style and languages, the viruses
is though written i pure assembly. </P>

<P>We're four members as for now, and we don't have any plans to expand.
We're between 16 and 20 years old and studying on different school's or
university's. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you prefer Cyberspace-contacts to talking
over a beer (or a glass of wine or ...)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well. Since I know all of Immortal Riot in a private matter and have
known Raver for a very long time it's kinda natural to met as normal friends.
This is the reason that we'll not accept new members even if they're great
coders. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You seem to dislike av-people because of their
making money out of the virus-business. So they take the users' money,
viruses take away time and data - or do you object? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't dislike anti-virus people because of they're making money out
of what let's say I'm doing. But what I don't like is their narrow-minded
attitude toward us. Also it's sad to see such rich people like for example
John Mcaffe lie about a virus capability just because he want to sell more
of his crappy anti-virus program. They're mainly motivated by greed and
not interested in helping their customers. If they were, they would have
printed correct information about viruses. Knowledge is always the best
way to avoid and get rid of viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">About your person: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think of myself as a normal youth who like parties, babes and fun
and I doubt anybody who know me would describe me much different. I'm just
normal - to normal maybe? Pretty hard question. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How old are you? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm 19 years old. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you male (silly question - but just to
make sure ...)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. I think most virus writers are male. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you student at high-school, college, university
or where are you occupied? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am studying at a university somewhere in Sweden. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you make your living? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't ;). I'm just wastening borrowed money. I have had the opporunity
to work, but that's pretty boring so I rather not. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do your parents, close relatives, non-cyberspace-friends,
does your partner know about your activity and Unforgiven-identity? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They know that I'm interested in computers but not exactly what I'm
doing behind it and they definitly not know my handle. Girls and parents
don't understand too much about computers, so what's the point in telling
them? </P>
</UL>
