<P><font color="#004080"><b>How did you start out in computers? </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Playin' round with a C64 waay back when I was 8... Coding simple graphics 
    and things like that in BASIC. I had a tape drive to go with it, a few games, 
    some demos, and hooked the whole thing up to a TV. I couldn't record anything 
    onto the tape, cos it wouldn't bloody work - so I lost interest in that after 
    a while. Then, someone attempted to teach me FORTRAN at about 9 or 10 I think. 
    No fun, I bailed out pretty quickly. Then, after messing around with various 
    IBM compatibles, I developed an interest in low-level structures, and viruses. 
    I used to mess around with bits of DOS, and tried pulling out bits of machine-code 
    looking things out of programs. There was noone round to teach me, however, 
    and that was quite frustrating after a while. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Oh, I kinda wandered onto IRC last February or January, and headed straight 
    to #virus. As an aside to that, I started out in virus writing much much earlier. 
    My very first own computer, a shitty monochrome 286 with a 40 meg drive got 
    hit by Exebug, and I couldn't get rid of it, since it messed with the CMOS 
    in some tricky way. Immediately I thought - "How amazing. I wanna be able 
    to do that." A year or so later, a friend of mine showed me some virus source 
    codes, and said he could teach me assembly language. I tried writing code 
    I had no clue about, but much later, everything suddenly became clear, and 
    I started to write properly. All this happened while I lived in a rather out-of-the-way 
    place where I could find no internet access of BBSs... So luckily, I got a 
    good grasp of everything I really had to learn before even getting access 
    to the internet. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would you like 
  to take credit for? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have. I'll take credit for whatever's in the wild at the moment and isn't 
    claimed by anyone else :-P </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> This is the bit I hate. All the good names are taken, and there's only a 
    bunch of obvious shitty names, and names which sound good at first, but become 
    worse and worse every time I hear 'em. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Bits and pieces of various things, but not in depth. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembly, by a long shot. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, the<a href="groups1.htm#FS"> Feathered Serpents</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't like endorsing commercial products. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Write the perfect virus? Nah, I think I'll kick around the scene, write 
    an occasional virus or article.. Oh, and further the Feathered Serpents' causes, 
    of course. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> The "war" is a media creation. It is there to thrill and titillate the average 
    brainless computer user. The computer media is sponsored by the anti-virus 
    industry to some degree, isn't it? Of course, the lovely, lovely anti-virus 
    PR types like a story that would sell a few more copies of the magazine - 
    it's more exposure for their advertising. They love a scare story - more scanners 
    are sold like that, it's practically free advertising. Of course, the certain 
    unnamed, richer anti-virus vendors keep pumping money into the media. That's 
    why shit products get great reviews, and excellent scanners are always left 
    out of tests. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I used it when I first got on IRC, and it kinda stuck. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No comment. They have been much talked about anyway, no need to add my two 
    cents. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Macro viruses are viruses just like any other type. They function differently, 
    but hey, if they get the job done.. I personally have little interest in them, 
    since I grew up with a belief that tight coding, speed, control and such things 
    were crucial, and macros don't have those in the same way that assembly viruses 
    do. HLL viruses can be interesting, since HLL subroutines make poor choices 
    for signature strings. If anyone can write a polymorph engine that creates 
    decryptors made solely out of HLL code, the poor anti-virus research people 
    are going to have one bad day. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Nope... I let one off on my old school's network, but it hasn't made it 
    to any researcher, so it might as well be dead. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> There's a whole lot that have been written, and quite a few that I like. 
    The least respect would be shared between <a href="ezines1.htm#NIJ">NuKE Infojournals</a>, 
    <a href="ezines1.htm#CENSOR">Censor</a>, <a href="ezines1.htm#EVOL">Evolution</a> 
    and <a href="ezines1.htm#CPI">CPI</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> The early Bulgarian programmers. Anyone who's done something innovative 
    or ground-breaking. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">In the AV world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Noone comes to mind. This isn't meant as a slight to anyone though. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Free-thinking, individualistic people. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> This is really an old debate. To the average computer user, a virus is inherently 
    bad. It's always psychologically damaging - it's an alien body within one's 
    system. Anyone I know who isn't a a programmer has this preconception that 
    viruses fuck up computers. To the average computer user, the term "payload" 
    has no meaning. Let ethics professors and virus researcher types talk about 
    this, it isn't pertinent to whatever you're doing, whether you are a virus 
    writer or an anti-virus software developer, researcher or PR person. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some viruses take VSAFE out of memory, that's good, isn't it? Good is too 
    subjective a term. Viruses taught me assembly language. That's good. The same 
    viruses might've wiped some poor sod's disks, which is bad. A 'good' virus 
    will do only good to anyone it infects, and since this is impossible, there's 
    no such thing as a strictly 'good' virus. Morals and ethics vary wildly from 
    one person to another, so it's pointless to debate the nature of 'good' and 
    'evil'. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Everything I can get into ;-) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, 
  girlfriend etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> A few people know, mostly friends. I don't hide it, it's what I do and I'm 
    not ashamed of it. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking, 
  phreaking, warez etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> How exactly would one make viruses illegal? Would one have to write down 
    guidelines for 'legal' and illegal 'code'? The definition of the term 'virus' 
    and the program code needed to create one would create a legal quagmire, restricting 
    the legitimate programmers more than virus writers. Besides that, virus writing 
    laws would be unenforceable unless the government watched anyone with a computer 
    24 hours a day. Tracking down a virus to its spreader would be just about 
    as easy as finding out where the fly you've got comes from. The whole effort 
    would suck in more time and resources than it would save. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> One that infects god's computer without god knowing. Heh.. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95/98) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Mass-produced, mass-marketed fodder. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Get your shit together, sit down and actually write something. </p>
</blockquote>
