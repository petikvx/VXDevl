<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The Internet brings a new dimension to the virus problem. Before, viruses
generally spread from system to system on physical media, often the floppy
disk. This is a fundamentally slow way for viruses to spread; if they are
bad at reproduction or they are too obvious, then they are unlikely to
become widespread this way. </P>

<P>The Internet changes all this. No longer are viruses restricted to the
slow, hand-to-hand infection hitherto the norm. The very ease with which
information can be exchanged can be a problem. </P>

<H3>Conventional viruses </H3>

<P>Most of the danger on the Internet comes from old viruses exploiting
new paths for transmission. There are basically two ways they can do this:
innocent and malicious distribution. </P>

<H3>Innocent virus distribution </H3>

<P>Sharing software over the Net is simple and easy; a simple mouse click
attaches a program to an email, and it is just as easy to detach and run
it. People can place a useful program on their web pages almost as simply,
and this can be downloaded by anyone anywhere. Any one of these programs
could be infected. </P>

<P>What kinds of viruses could these practices spread? Purely boot sector
viruses are out. Parasitic file viruses work well in this environment,
although many (but no means all) users are cautious about obtaining programs
from places they do not trust. </P>

<P>The viruses that <I>really</I> win in the Internet environment are the
macro viruses. They are attached to data, not code, making them harder
to avoid. An increasing number of documents on the Net are available as
Word files, for example, with no alternative format. </P>

<P>The only solution here is to obtain viewer programs which read the data
in the file but ignore the macros. Such programs are available for Word
and Excel among others. Never open a file you do not trust with the application
that created it. </P>

<H3>Malicious virus distribution </H3>

<P>Viruses may also be spread by malicious individuals, knowingly passing
on infected programs. Virus authors and others find the Internet perfect
for giving a new virus a start in life, by means of hundreds of unsuspecting
Internet users; by infecting an attractive-looking file that then gets
placed in a public download area, the virus can spread far in a short time.
</P>

<P>As before, caution is your protection here. Although less common than
innocent distribution, maliciously distributed viruses are more likely
to be new, maybe even previously unknown. Do not download programs unless
you completely trust the source, and do not view documents in the creating
application - use a viewer. </P>

<H3>Java </H3>

<P>Java has been much in the news recently, and concern has been expressed
over its security. </P>

<P>Java is supposed to run applets in an isolated environment from which
they cannot escape. This requires a flawless, bug-free Java environment,
which is unlikely to exist yet. Faults have already been found (and fixed),
and more probably lurk undetected. Some of the discovered flaws have been
serious, allowing the applet to escape completely and do everything a normal
program could. </P>

<P>Can Java <I>viruses</I> exist, though? The answer appears to be a qualified
`no'. </P>

<P>Java applets generally flow in one direction; from server to client,
where they stop. Users do not generally give Java applets to their friends;
instead, they tell them where to go and see them. Java applets do not get
saved to local disk, except as web cache. They are not good candidates
for infection; if an applet escaped from the cage Java is meant to keep
it in, there would be no point in it trying to infect other applets, since
they would never spread. </P>

<P>Harmful Java is likely to be in the form of Trojan horse applets instead;
intentionally malicious pieces of code masquerading as innocent. Given
the speed with which Sun Microsystems, Netscape and other Java vendors
have fixed security problems once they have been discovered, any such applet
is unlikely to work for long. </P>

<H3>Cookies</H3>

<P>Cookies have also been the subject of a number of uninformed scares
lately. In reality, the only problem with them is a privacy issue; they
cannot do any damage to your system. Cookies are a system in newer Web
browsers enabling sites to remember you, and keep track of your visits.
Some people do not want them to do this, and prefer the greater anonymity
they used to have. This is the only real problem with cookies. </P>

<H3>Email viruses</H3>

<P>There have been a number of scare stories about <I>email viruses</I>
in recent years. These have become widespread, with many people taking
them seriously. All of them are untrue. While viruses can be <I>carried</I>
in email messages in the form of attachments, these are only dangerous
if detached and run (or in the case of macro viruses, viewed using the
creating application). </P>

<P>Electronic mail messages themselves <B>cannot</B> become infected by
viruses, with current email technology. Reading the text portion of an
email is always safe. Extracting and viewing attachments may not be. </P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>In conclusion, viruses on the Internet are, by and large, old problems
in new clothes. The largest problems are the ease with which infected programs
or documents can be found and run, and how quickly a new virus can spread
in this environment. So far, though, no viruses are `internet-aware'; only
their authors are. </P>
