<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Due to my great age, in the beginning 80's. My very first computer was
a TI99/4A, then a C64. After, i used Mac and PC at school and university,
but not for programming, just for the classic use of a computer by a student:
word processing, calculations, etc... I had my own PC at home in the middle
of the 90's, so very late. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The first time i saw the word &quot;virus&quot; , maybe in 1985 or 1986,
when Brain was released, i was fascinated. Really fascinated. That was
not just curiosity. How could a computer program be &quot;alive&quot; and
reproduce itself? I was a science-fiction fan, and of course I had read
a lot of story about computers, robots, this kind of things. The fiction
became reality. Like Dr Frankenstein, it was possible to feel the emotion
of creating something looking like life, to feel like a little god. Writing
a virus is a metaphysic experiment. </P>

<P>But i just knew BASIC, and i didn't have any serious computer at home
because that was too expensive. So i had to wait a long time before experimenting
my own viruses. In 1996, i found an old 386/16 in a trash, at my job. I
stole it, bought a monitor, a little book about assembler, and i started
to code. First, some little graphic VGA effects, like demos, because i
remembered intros of cracked programs in the C64. And one day, i thought:
&quot;now, you know enough asm to code a virus&quot;. So i downloaded all
technical information on the Net (e-zines, tutorials, etc...), and started
on the virus scene. My first virus was released at the end of 1996. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I wrote a lot of viruses at home, but i just released 4 viruses at this
time (september 97): NoPasaran, Cosmos, MarsLand, and Elvira. All non-destructive,
it's very important i think, and all with graphic effects. Something like
auto-reproducing little demos. I sometimes spend more time to code the
payload than the infection routines. Well, i really like the voxel effect
in my MarsLand virus, and the more complex routines in my last bug, Elvira
(4250 bytes). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I try to choose some poetic names, or names with a signification. That
can be because of the payload, or because i dedicate a virus to someone.
But AV do not like poetry, so they name it with some technical names, like
Spanska.1120. NoPasaran was dedicated to young anti-fascists fighters in
Spain, Cosmos to Carl Sagan, MarsLand to nobody, and Elvira to the girl
that i love. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The C64 BASIC, but not very useful nowadays... and the assembler. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The only that i know: assembler. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. I sometimes think that would be cool to join a group, but i'm too
free to accept a group's conditions, even if it's just to release an article
at time for a zine. I code when i want to code, i cannot force myself.
Sometimes i spend one month without coding. And computing is a lonely activity,
especially underground computing. I like to talk about virus technics or
philosophy with other coders, but that's all. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>First, the least: McAfee. I think i don't have to explain why. </P>

<P>I use at home 5 AV softwares: AVP, F-Prot, FindVirus, TBAV and DrWeb.
They all are good products, with powerful heuristics capacities. I respect
the guys who code these softwares. I think a good heuristic algorithm is
as interesting as a good infection routine. I like both virus and antivirus
technology. A lot of virus writers hate AV guys. I do not. </P>

<P>The case of TBAV is special. It's a very good soft, but it's too a necessary
tool for the virus writer who wants to avoid heuristic detection, because
of the description of the flags, and its speed. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My goals? I would like that an average user hit by one of my viruses
begin to think: &quot;Hey, the graphic effect is cool, and this bug did
not destroy anything... Let's read the message... It's about what? NoPasaran?
What does it mean? Spanish Civil War? What's that? Let's find some information
about this! Finally, viruses can be sympathic...&quot;. Here's one of my
goals. Maybe very naive, but i would like to show that viruses can be used
as a a way to communicate something. Like graffitis on a city walls, a
way of expression between message and art. I use computer monitors and
assembler like others guys in the street use walls and painting sprays.
</P>

<P>This is why i really appreciated when i saw in the F-Prot web database
the explanation of the NoPasaran meaning. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The term &quot;war&quot; is a little exagerated. I prefer &quot;game&quot;.
Like the cat and the mouse. Because the only thing that we can kill are
bytes, not humans. It's a big difference. </P>

<P>There are some neutral places, like alt.comp.virus, where both sides
can speak together. And it's not always insults. Sometimes a little nervous,
but it's normal. What people do not understand generally is that each side
needs the other side. For us, a virus often really start to exist when
its name appears in AV databases, when people know it and start talking
about it. And AV would not exist without virus coders. In biology, it's
called symbiosis. And it's interesting to see the co-evolution. One side
invents a new technique, some monthes later the other side invent an original
routine to avoid/detect this new technique. There are a lot of analogies
with biological world. </P>

<P>Talking about war, a funny thing that you discover when you read each
day alt.comp.virus, is that discussion between different AV guys is sometimes
far more hard and full of insults than between AV and Vx guys. Look at
a dialog between Zvi Netiv and Vesselin Bontchev or between McAfee and
DrSolomon staffs, you will understand what i mean. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Spanska&quot; means &quot;the spanish guy&quot; in swedish. But
i'm not from Spain, neither from Sweden. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Creators are ambiguous. They have, like everything, two opposite sides.
</P>

<P>On one side, they are cool to put the chaos in the AV world, because
these guys have to fight against thousands of different variants.Time and
work they cannot use against our original creations. </P>

<P>On the other side, they are dangerous because they bring virus technology
to everyone. All the guys i knew that used creators didn't know programmation,
and just wanted to destroy. When you want to create something, a symphony,
a house or a virus, first you have to learn. It's a long and hard time,
but necessary, because during this time you can think about what you are
doing, and see if you really want to go until the end. I don't know a single
good song made by a guy that do not know music. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I do not know macro languages. But it's interesting, because it's a
new way. Operating systems are becoming more and more complex and protected,
so we have to find new manners to create reproducing programs. Macro viruses
are symbols of this evolution. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Two of my viruses are in the last <A HREF="misc0004.htm">Joe Well's
Wild List</A> (June 97). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like the good oldies, like <A HREF="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40Hex</A> or
<A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">Vlad</A>. But some new zines are quite good,
like <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</A> mag, which contains a lot of new
and original viruses/articles and which have a very high technical level
(even the mag viewer is excellent), <A HREF="ezines1.htm#SOK">Source of
Kaos</A> which is very dense, technic and intelligent and do not contains
habitual teen's point of view (&quot;Kewl man! My virus is da best! I'm
the King! Kill all lamerz computers!&quot;). Xine is cool because all the
articles are very pedagogic. And <A HREF="ezines1.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A> mag
is becoming better and better. </P>

<P>The least? Well, i don't know. Maybe one zine called Virus World that
contained articles stolen in others zines or in AV databases, with signatures
changed. Or <A HREF="ezines1.htm#AST">Asterix</A>, not because of the articles,
but because i never was able to install it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">Griyo</A>, this guy is a great coder.
I respect <A HREF="groups1.htm#GEN">Rajaat</A> too, because he always invents
new original things, and his articles are very well written, very clear.
I like people writing tutorials, because it's harder than to just write
code. Mark Ludwig's books are cool for that. On the web, i love the job
made by Poltergst at <A HREF="http://www.wcivr.com">WCIVR</A> and by you,
Cicatrix. When you have VDAT, you have all. There are new french coders
too, not known for the moment, who start to code good things (Unknm Mnemonic,
Omy l'Architecte, Kawik). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know very well AV people. I respect their products, i read their
posts in alt.comp.virus, but that's all. Pierre Vandevenne, a belgian guy
working for DataRescue (they distribute F-Prot) is cool, very funny and
quite open-minded. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like demo coders. They program things really incredible, often beautiful,
and their motivation is not money. I like limited-size demos, sometimes
really ass-kicking: a textured-mapped, phong-shaded rotating 3D object
in 4 Ko, a voxel effect in 128 bytes... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I really do not like that. Viruses are basically auto-reproducing programs.
Destruction is something different. Users have to understand that both
things are not always linked. There are two principal reasons why i will
never put a destructive code inside one my viruses. First, i respect other
people's work. A virus can perturb the launching of a program, well, it's
not very important because you can reinstall it. But purposely and definitively
destruct personal datas is a stupid and primary thing. This is my moral.
Each one have his own. The second reason is that a destructive payload
is too easy to code. Formatting a HD? Twenty lines of assembler, coded
in one minute. Deleting a file? Five instructions. Written in one second.
Easy things are not interesting for the coder. I prefer spend weeks to
code a beautiful VGA effect. I prefer create than destruct. It's so important
for me that i put this phrase in my MarsLand virus: &quot;Coding a virus
can be creative&quot;. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It depends on what you mean by &quot;good&quot;. I sometimes consider
viruses as artistic creations. Is art &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;?
I don't know. If you mean &quot;useful&quot;, why not? There are programs
that use virus technology to crypt disks, like KOH, or viruses that compact
programs, like Cruncher. Doren Rosenthal proposes a safe virus to test
AV softs. It's easy to imagine viruses that can disinfect other viruses,
or eliminate unnecessary files, or what you want. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Something very far from computing. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend, etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. My family, my friends, my girlfriend all know. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some hacking, but at a very little level. I read a lot about all undergound
computer activities, but i do not have the time to practice. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Generally, coding viruses at home is not illegal, but spreading them
is. I think it's normal. In a democracy, laws are made to protect citizens.
Including against viruses. That just reflects the big difference between
creation and spreading. But i like to spread a lot my viruses, using the
internet. They do not destruct, so there's no ethic problem for me. It's
illegal, sure, but doing illegal things with some risks is always funny,
no? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Perfection does not exist. But a cool virus could be multi-OS, multipartite,
full-stealth, polymorphic, etc... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95)?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't have W95. About Windows in general, the classical thing is to
spit against all Microsoft creations, when you are in the computer underground.
We just forget that there are millions of guys all over the world that
use computers just for simple things like word processing, and do not even
know the difference between a Mac and a PC. For these guys, ergonomic and
easy-to-use systems like Windows or MacOs are perfect. It's so stupid to
tell them &quot;Use Linux, you lamer!&quot;. Well, that does not significate
that i love Windows. But i use it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Do not destruct and be original! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>
