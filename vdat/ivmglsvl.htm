<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>When i was 'bout 11 or 12, we had an school excursion to some weirdo
named research institute. But, unfortunately, the institute had something
to do with computers and i was right fascinated with all the stuff i saw
there. </P>

<P>&lt;some time skipped&gt; </P>

<P>Got my first computer (do not remember the name), saled it after 2 weekz
to but that new Atari 800 XL (really). After the 8 bit era I started to
save money for some 286 ... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>One friend of mine did some virus analyses, I was keen on the stuff,
but nothing more. Then i meet a guy on our school computer lab, which was
coding somethin' in assembler, the proggie was real tiny and did so much...
The guy was future JX from SVL, so we hold a speech and .... You know already
:) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I did. I do. I'll do. Only the time is problem. I lacks of it in last
time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>At will. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>C,asm,pascal,basic </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>asm </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, i was member of <A HREF="groups2.htm#SVL">SVL</A> for some time,
but after it's end i am some kind of freelance virus coder. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, based on my own experiences, and naturally assumption that every
sane user (but there is not such a lot of this kind) uses antivirus software
produced by local vendor, i respect slovak one. This program is named NOD-ice,
and has to the great unpleasure of us, virus coders, very sophicticated
heuristics. It is, in my opinion, one of the foremost AV programs in the
world. Simply to express how good it is, just one quotation: </P>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><B>Sepultura:</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B>&quot;I do not know what methods ICE-NOD uses, but it is
very good too&quot; </B></P></CENTER>

<UL>
<P>If your virus passes without detection by NOD, it passes every antivirus.
And that's why i use this one for testing my viruses. And i highly recomend
to other authors the same. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Same as the others have: to write kick the ass virus, that'll spread
across the world in 48 hours. :P </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV.</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It is not about the war. It is most likely the brain contest. But on
the virus side, there are no prices. The AV side of the force offers much
more : money, car, house, career etc... But i am not interested in. Besides
many of the AV seems to be assholes, but actually not all of them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, is my old nick. And it sounds good quit good. So i keep supporting
it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>For it's authors it was just challenge, to bring the proof it could
be done. The practical effect of existing <A HREF="creators.htm">virus
creators</A> is none. Every virus produced this way is lame. But maybe,
in the future someone with nothing to do, with necessary knowledges and
abilities 'll write a break through in the creators, with generating own
poly engines etc. This threat is most likely only my fantasy. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Macros' are easy to code, the documents are moved from one to another
PC much more than programs, so they can spread fast and far. Probably multiplatform
macros 'll appear. Here is the playfield wide open. HLL viruses are lame
but on the other hand are problem for AV companies. HLL viruses can't be
identified by heuristics, its spread is very limited and to get sample
not so easy. But they have no great future. HLL writing author has to switch
to asm or to go. Asm 'll persist and survive. The perspectives of powerfull
combination of asm and macroviruses ... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes i do. I check <A HREF="misc0004.htm">Joe Wells' list</A> on regular
base. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is the virus scene in Slovakia? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We, the old generation are heading to make some serious money. But most
of us has some good ideas for viruses. Pitty we have not that much time.
But on the other hand, scene is stable, we have new additions, the recent
ones are quit valuable. In last year slovak VX scene did two big things.
One was the TMC virus, which has been in the wild in Slovakia, but did
not get not only into the Joe's supplementary list (Barnabas Nagy is probably
asshole, or Joe is ignoring at least some contributors). Second reinforcement
are Ugly Luser and Nasty Lamer, authors of first two slovak macroviruses,
Uglykid and Slow (aka Slovak dictator). Generally the W95 beta test slowed
down the scene movement. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will you ever release a virus creator? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. Is is not effective. </P>

<P>As for me, i am heading for next issue ... and to finish at least two
more viruses. </P>
