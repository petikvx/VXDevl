<font color="#004080"><b>How did you start out in computers? </b></font> 
<blockquote>
  <p> When I was a kid I used to play with my parents Texas Instruments, programed 
    it to add 2 and 2. And when my dad got a 286 with a modem my brother and I 
    used to connect to local (and not so local) BBS's and just talk to people, 
    it was like magic to us..... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I think about a year ago (perhaps more/less)...I caught Anticmos.A from 
    some guy who loaned me a floppy disk....it was fascinating to me...I knew 
    somthing was wrong within a hour, but this guy had this virus for well over 
    a year and a half and didnt know it, he got it from some guy he knew in TX 
    and given it to 3 other people in the building...who would likly have helped 
    it complete its journy clear across the country had i not been infected. The 
    way it functioned and worked was fascinating, it had infected over 250 of 
    this guys floppies, I can only imagine the places that virus went. I think 
    that is the point when I truly became interested in creating viruses; learning 
    the art of making the unexpected happen. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would you like 
  to take credit for? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes Ive written several, amoung them (aka=av's name for them): Phoebe (aka 
    Phoebe.2523), Stella.440 (aka spooky.440), Prospero (aka Opic.1712 or prospero.1712), 
    Odessa (aka opic.727), Odessa.B and on and on......... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>How did you name your viruses? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> For awhile I named my viruses only females names because I liked the notion 
    of them being like a storm, hurricane, a Big ship or somthing along those 
    lines. Man seems to name everything he cannot control after a woman. After 
    I got over that little pun I named them after the concepts that the virus 
    carries inside of themselves. I write viruses (other then for the technical 
    challenge and innovations) to communicate with others. You are creating a 
    unique situation when a virus infection occurs. The user is compelled to listen 
    out of fear or confusion or whatever, and a special dialogue is created in 
    which you have that persons undivided attention for as long as it takes them 
    to figure out whats is going on....this seems to me to be a valuable time 
    for me to say somthing important. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which programming languages do you know? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have focused mainly on Assembly however lately I've been toying with some 
    HLL's like Pascal, VB (if you can even call that a language), Delphi, and 
    C++. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembly, of course :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Are/were you a member of a VX group? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, I'm a member of the CodeBreakers. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Hmmm....I dont think that I like any software enough to say "use this one 
    not this one", but I think AVP does a good job staying up to date (though 
    it cant detect a new virus from a shit on the wall untill they update it) 
    and I think Kaspersky might be a bit on the, uh, slow side the way he is constantly 
    mis/renaming viruses I guess there isn't any particular scanner Id plug as 
    being really good or really bad (well......ok Mcafee is REALLY bad), ..but 
    I've seen good work from some, bad from others. it seems to me there are always 
    a few individuals in each company that define the companies attitude: Some 
    do their job in a very open-minded fashion, others feel a necessity to create 
    a 'pissing contest' between AV and VX, and others who like to demonize the 
    virus and the virus author by choosing to use 'scare tactics' rather then 
    making a good product (Mcafee Example: anyone else seen their TV commercial 
    with several migets painted green? ). Anyways it seems to me that the best 
    AVers are the ones who either dont haves alot of ego-involvment in their work, 
    and/or have an open mind towards the concept of viruses... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What are/were your goals (VX wise)? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Other then to continue to expand my knowledge through virus writing, I would 
    like to focus on helping make the transition of viruses and virus writers 
    from a DOS based enviornment to the Non-DOS enviorment which will follow Windbloze98. 
    There is this stigma on windows programming with virus writers that needs 
    to be broken; I think many of them do not realize that the first generation 
    of virus writers emerged and began to approach writing viruses for DOS, it 
    was probably equally as intimidating, but we should feel lucky to take on 
    this new challenge; DOS viruses have been done and are coming close to being 
    done. It is time to bring the common virus writer into this new age of virus 
    writing. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It is a scam. It is another tool that the AV use to make a situation seem 
    more out of hand, or dangerous then it really is, because plain and simple: 
    scandal sells. Perhaps some AV are not aware that they are "playing a role" 
    but I suspect most do. I try to avoid becoming a part of this because I am 
    (as they are) well aware of the fact that they make a living off what I do 
    out of creative ambition. Im sure that this is inevitable but I'll be damned 
    if I'm going to give them a hand at it. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I could elaborate on this but I'd hate to bore you with some half-assed 
    personal story. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> They pose a valuable challenge to those to set out to write them. And they 
    can be a good learning tool for people just starting out, as they can examine 
    the code. Unlike most other coders I know people who add their name to the 
    end of the virus and say that they wrote it dont really bother me, we all 
    know they didnt write it, they are always scannable and never spread, there 
    is a deffinitive difference between a real virus and a virus created from 
    a lab. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Macro viruses were an interesting and a sucessful invention when they occured. 
    The ordeal has gotten a bit out of hand as far as the number of macro viruses 
    out there, but reproducing code is interesting no matter in what form it comes 
    in-and it was a great new step for the virus writer. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've been told and read of some of my viruses circulating in the wild, but 
    as far as I known none of them have been on the "in-the-wild" list.....yet. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which VX E-zine do you like most? Which the least? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Outside of the CodeBreakers VX zine? 29a has a top notch thing going, as 
    does SLAM, there are countless VX zines that are great but I think that those 
    two are my favorites....There are none that I can think of that I dislike, 
    there are just some that were more then I expected and I respect them for 
    suprising me. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Too many names to mention! Ive met a lot of great virus writers out there....groups 
    I'll list: CodeBreakers (gotta be #1), 29a, Slam, No Mercy Virus Team, Feathered 
    Serpents..... Im only listing the Live ones cuz the dead ones have already 
    had thier time and been given thier credit. Coders without groups: Spanska, 
    Buz, ARC, and guilhem </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>In the AV world? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I think that Peter Szor (F-prot) does a good job analyizing viruses (though 
    F-Prot itself ain't all that hot), so Kudos to Peter (perhaps this is bad 
    publicity for him, but i hope not....). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </b></font> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Anyone who is working to further the underground. And by this I do not mean 
    only the computer underground, but any (music, literature, art, intellectual 
    ect. ect.) underground. And from my experince they are all pretty closely 
    related in thier mentality and approach to things. Its is truly essential 
    that the world to have an underground...to have a group of passionatly motivated 
    people who will push in from all sides onto the mainstream forcing changes 
    in the status quo and theway the majority will view and react to things...without 
    this society would become stale and rotten without change. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, 1st off they have been done to death. 2nd, they tend to make people 
    notice your virus, which would obviously keep it from spreading any further. 
    And, 3rd why bother when there are so many more interesting and creative manipulations 
    you can make to a system? Generally I dont look down on people who write destructive 
    rutines, as it is thier decision, but I am less likly to be interested in 
    thier code, I would be more interested in seeing code to a virus that dials 
    a victums modem to say; the authors ex- girlfriends house rather then one 
    that destroys a disk. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Sure, but I'm in favor of them so I think lots of viruses are good. :) But 
    really, I think there are benificial viruses, and I think that programmers 
    may take method from virus writers all the time. There are some viruses now 
    which contain compression engines which will actually shrink the size of an 
    infected file saving the victum extra space on thier HDD....sounds good to 
    me. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What do you do in 'real' life? </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well outside of writing viruses (that's my real life also isnt it? yes, 
    i think it is...) I go to an art skool (college) and am planning a wonderful 
    career in starving to death, hang out with friends, write, paint, follow underground 
    music, ect, ect. In actuality a computer has no other place in my life except 
    writing viruses and learning about computer themselves function. It is a decision 
    on my part to even turn one on, and in a way I feel lucky for that, as some 
    guys have to sit on computers doing things they dispise all day, for me its 
    a pleasure; to do and explore whatever I like. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, 
  girlfriend etc.)? </b></font><b> </b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some do; my parents, my girlfriend, and a few close friends know. The rest 
    do not, as they have no need to. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Did you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking, 
  phreaking, warez etc.)? </b></font><b> </b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Not much, I dabbled in hacking a bit, phreaking was too risky for my blood, 
    and warez is really boring to me (does it bother anyone else that 16 yr old 
    kids sit on a computer for 3+ days obsessivly collecting apps that he will 
    never use...it just doest sit well with me I guess). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Making the writing of viruses illegal is a breech of the Constitution and 
    the Bill of Rights, so whoever wants to can have a fun time trying to convince 
    everyone to make a new draft and put their John Hanncock on it (but yes I'll 
    be the first one pullin the pen from yer hand). And I think there is a clear 
    difference between the writing and spreading of viruses, anyone who thinks 
    differently probably hasnt considered it well enough yet. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Describe the perfect virus. </b></font><b></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> One that learns from its mistakes. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> New frontier for virus writers: stop spiteing it and start infecting it! 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> At first writing viruses is Two steps forwards, three steps back. This will 
    change in time, read and ask questions, and then read some more. Its just 
    like learning anything else.....just add water. </p>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your future plans, projects (VX wise)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Write more and better viruses, tutorials, apps, and bring the CodeBreakers 
    into Infamy. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Any new tutorials planned? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes in CB #4 (which will probably be released by the time you read this) 
    there will be a tutorial on the values and practice of Reverse Engineering 
    authored by myself and Horny Toad. Also I have plans to write some tutorials 
    on polymorphism in concept and practice. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">If you can eleborate on The Codebreakers </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> The CodeBreakers have tried to fill in the gaps in the study and explanation 
    of virus writing. We have made virus writing accessible to the layman. Our 
    VX zines start from the ground up and we are leaving no stone unturned, for 
    our audience: we are bearing all. At first we were criticized for teaching 
    such basic material in depth the way we have, but now in retrospect (as we 
    move more and more into advanced techniques - and even moreso into the future 
    when we will deal with windows virus writing in many approaches) it will prove 
    to be a huge and notable acomplishment......as once we will have brought basic 
    virus writing to the layman in full we will push the new frontiers to the 
    point of collapse........ The CodeBreakers: Committed to Excellence. </p>
