<p><b>Understanding how viruses work is the first step in defending against them.</b></p>
<p>If you buy a new computer these days, it's likely to ship with an antivirus 
  package. This fact, more than anything else, should convince us of how widespread 
  viruses have become and how much the computer industry has come to accept their 
  inevitability. Quite simply, viruses are a fact of computing life. </p>
<p>There are thousands of viruses out there and many different categories of virus, 
  but generally they all fit a single basic definition. A virus is a computer 
  program intentionally designed to associate itself with another computer program 
  in a way that when the original program is run, the virus program is run as 
  well, and the virus replicates itself by attaching itself to other programs. 
  The virus associates itself with the original program by attaching itself to 
  that program or even by replacing it, and the replication is sometimes in the 
  form of a modified version of the virus program. The infected program can be 
  a macro, and it can be a disk's boot sector, the very first program loaded from 
  a bootable disk. </p>
<p>Notice the &quot;intentionally designed&quot; part of the definition. Viruses 
  aren't just accidents. Programmers with significant skills author and develop 
  them, then find ways to get them onto the computers of the unsuspecting. And 
  the stronger antivirus programs get, the harder virus authors work to get around 
  them. For many virus authors, the whole thing is simply a challenge; for others, 
  the point is having a good time making computing life uncertain or even miserable. 
  Too bad: They could make gobs of money solving the Y2K crisis instead. </p>
<p>Viruses have quite correctly gained a reputation for being harmful, but in 
  reality many are not. Yes, some damage files or perform other forms of destructiveness, 
  but many are simply minor annoyances or are even invisible to most users. To 
  be considered a virus, a program need only replicate itself; anything else it 
  does is extra. </p>
<p>Even relatively pain-free viruses aren't completely harmless, of course. They 
  consume disk space, memory, and CPU resources and therefore affect the speed 
  and efficiency of your machine. Furthermore, the antivirus programs that sniff 
  them out and eliminate them also consume memory and CPU resources; many users, 
  in fact, claim they slow the computer down noticeably and are more intrusive 
  than the viruses themselves. In other words, viruses affect your computing life 
  even when they're not actually doing anything. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Viruses and Virus-like Programs</b></p>
<p> The above explanation of viruses is actually more specific than the way we 
  tend to use the term virus. Other types of programs exist that fit only part 
  of that definition. What they have in common with viruses is that they act without 
  the user's knowledge and commit some kind of act inside the computer that they 
  are intentionally designed to do. These types include worms, Trojan horses, 
  and droppers. All of these programs, including viruses, are part of a category 
  of program known as malware, or malicious-logic software. </p>
<p>A worm is a program that replicates itself but doesn't infect other programs. 
  It copies itself to and from floppy disks or across network connections, and 
  sometimes it uses the network in order to run. One type of worm--the host worm--uses 
  the network only to copy itself onto other machines, while another type, the 
  network worm, spreads parts of itself across networks and relies on network 
  connections to run its various parts. Worms can also exist on a nonnetworked 
  computer, in which case they can copy to various locations on your hard disks. 
</p>
<p>The name Trojan horse comes from the Greek myth, best recounted in The Odyssey, 
  in which the Greek army left a wooden horse as a gift to the Trojans, hiding 
  troops inside the horse as it was taken into Troy. The Greeks jumped out and 
  captured the city, ending the long siege. The idea in computers is the same. 
  A Trojan horse is a program that is hidden inside a seemingly harmless program. 
  When that program is run, the Trojan horse launches in order to perform actions 
  that the user doesn't want. Trojan horses do not replicate themselves. </p>
<p>Droppers are programs designed to avoid antivirus detection, usually by encryption 
  that prevents antivirus software from noticing them. The typical functions of 
  droppers are transporting and installing viruses. They wait on the system for 
  a specific event, at which point they launch themselves and infect the system 
  with the contained virus. </p>
<p>Related to these programs is the concept of the bomb. Bombs are usually built 
  into malware as a means of activating it. Bombs are programmed to activate when 
  a specific event occurs. Some bombs activate at a specific time, typically using 
  the system clock. A bomb could be programmed to erase all DOC files from your 
  hard disk on New Year's Eve or pop up a message on a famous person's birthday. 
  Others are triggered by other events or conditions: A bomb might wait for the 
  twentieth instance of a program launch, for example, and erase the program's 
  template files. Viewed this way, bombs are just malicious scripts or scheduling 
  programs. </p>
<p>Viruses can be thought of as special instances involving one or more of these 
  malware programs. They can be spread through droppers (although they need not 
  be), and they use the worm idea to replicate themselves. While viruses are not 
  technically Trojan horses, they act like them in two ways: First, they do things 
  the user doesn't want; second, by attaching themselves to an existing program, 
  they effectively turn the original program into a Trojan horse (they hide inside 
  it, launch when it launches, and commit unwanted acts). </p>

<p><b>How a Virus Works</b></p>
<p><b>Viruses work in different ways, but here's the basic process. </b></p>
<p>First, the virus appears on your system. It usually enters as part of an infected 
  program file (COM, EXE, or boot sector). In the past viruses traveled almost 
  exclusively through the distribution of infected floppy disks. Today, viruses 
  are frequently downloaded from networks (including the Internet) as part of 
  larger downloads, such as part of the setup files for a trial program, a macro 
  for a specific program, or an attachment on a e-mail message. </p>
<p>Note that the e-mail message itself cannot be a virus. A virus is a program, 
  and it must be run to become active. A virus delivered as an e-mail attachment, 
  therefore, does nothing until you run it. You run this kind of virus by launching 
  the attachment, usually by double-clicking on it. One way to help protect yourself 
  from this kind of virus is simply never to open attachments that are executable 
  files (EXE or COM) or data files for programs, such as office suites, that provide 
  macro-writing features. A graphics, sound, or other data file is safe. </p>
<p>A virus starts its life on your PC, therefore, as a Trojan horse-like program. 
  It is hidden within another program or file and launches with that file. In 
  an infected executable file, the virus has essentially modified the original 
  program to point to the virus code and launch that code along with its own code. 
  Typically, it jumps to the virus code, executes that code, and then jumps back 
  to the original code. At this point the virus is active, and your system is 
  infected. </p>
<p>Once active, the virus either does its work immediately--if it's a direct-action 
  virus--or sits in the background as a memory-resident program, using the TSR 
  (terminate and stay resident) procedure allowed by the operating system. Most 
  are of this second type and are called resident viruses. Given the vast range 
  of activities allowed by TSR programs--everything from launching programs to 
  backing up files and watching for keyboard or mouse activity (and much more)--a 
  resident virus can be programmed to do pretty much anything the operating system 
  can do. Using a bomb, it can wait for events to trigger it, then go to work 
  on your system. One of the things it can do is scan your disk or (more significantly) 
  your networked disks for other running (or executable) programs, then copy itself 
  to those programs to infect them as well. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Virus Types</b></p>
<p>Virus authors are constantly experimenting with new ways to infect your system, 
  but the actual types of virus remain few. These are boot sector viruses, file 
  infectors, and macro viruses. There are different names for these types and 
  some subtypes, but the idea remains the same. </p>
<p>Boot sector viruses or infectors reside in specific areas of the PC's hard 
  disk, those that are read and executed by the computer at boot time. True boot 
  sector viruses infect only the DOS boot sector, while a subtype called the MBR 
  virus infects the master boot record. Both of these areas of the hard disk are 
  read during the boot process, during which the virus is loaded into memory. 
  Viruses can infect the boot sectors of floppy disks, but typically a virus-free, 
  write-protected boot floppy disk has always been a safe way to start the system. 
  The problem, of course, is guaranteeing that the floppy disk itself is uninfected, 
  and that's a task that antivirus programs attempt to do. </p>
<p>File infectors, also called parasitic viruses, are viruses that attach themselves 
  to executable files, and they are the most common and the most discussed. Such 
  a virus typically waits in memory for the user to run another program, using 
  such an event as a trigger to infect that program as well. Thus they replicate 
  simply through active use of the computer. There are different types of file 
  infectors, but the concept is similar in all of them. </p>
<p>Macro viruses, a relatively new type, make use of the fact that many programs 
  ship with programming languages built-in. The languages are designed to help 
  users automate tasks through the creation of small programs called macros. The 
  programs in Microsoft Office, for instance, ship with such a built-in language, 
  and in fact it provides many of its own built-in macros. A macro virus is simply 
  a macro for one of these programs, and indeed this type of virus became known 
  through its infection of Microsoft Word. When a document or template containing 
  the virus macro is opened in the target application, the virus runs and does 
  its damage. In addition, it is programmed to copy itself into other documents, 
  so that continual use of the program results in continual spread of the virus. 
</p>
<p>A fourth type, called multipartite, combines boot sector infection with file 
  infection. </p>
<p>For a huge listing of viruses along with explanations of what they do, see 
  the Virus Encyclopedia section of Symantec's AntiVirus Research Center. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Smarter and Smarter</b></p>
<p>The macro virus concept works because the programming language provides access 
  to memory and hard disks. So, in fact, do other recent technologies, including 
  ActiveX controls and Java applets. True, these are designed to protect the hard 
  disk from the virus program (Java better than ActiveX), but the fact is that 
  these programs can install themselves on your computer simply because you visit 
  a Web site. Obviously, as we become increasingly networked and as we expect 
  such conveniences as operating-system upgrades over the Internet (Windows 98 
  and NT 5 both do this), we put ourselves at greater risk from viruses and other 
  malware. </p>
<p>Virus authors are nothing if not innovative, and they constantly come up with 
  new ways of thwarting antivirus software. Stealth viruses, for example, mislead 
  the antivirus software into thinking that nothing is wrong. Essentially, a stealth 
  virus retains information about the files it has infected, then waits in memory 
  and intercepts antivirus programs that are looking for altered files. It gives 
  the antivirus programs the old information rather than the new. Polymorphic 
  viruses alter themselves when they replicate, so that antivirus software that 
  looks for specific patterns won't find all instances of the viruses; those that 
  survive can continue replicating. Several other types of smart viruses are appearing 
  regularly, as the game of cat and mouse between virus authors and antivirus 
  software producers continues. In all likelihood, viruses are here to stay. </p>

<p><b>How a Common Virus Spreads</b></p>
<p>1. An application infected with a common virus loads into memory. Even when 
  the application terminates, the virus remains in memory.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="tu1803_001.jpg" width="155" height="155"></p>
<p>2. The virus infects one or more other applications. Some viruses use idle 
  time to search for applications, while others infect applications as they are 
  loaded into memory. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="tu1803_002.jpg" width="155" height="155"></p>
<p> <br>
  3. These virus-infected applications can then be transmitted via removable media, 
  a network, or the Internet. </p>
