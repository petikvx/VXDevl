<P>If you are active in the anti-virus research field, then you will regularly
receive requests for virus samples. Some requests are easy to deal with:
they come from fellow-researchers whom you know well, and whom you trust.
Using strong encryption, you can send them what they have asked for by
almost any medium (including across the Internet) without any real risk.
</P>

<P>Other requests come from people you have never heard from before. There
are relatively few laws (though some countries do have them) preventing
the secure exchange of viruses between consenting individuals, though it
is clearly irresponsible for you simply to make viruses available to anyone
who asks. Your best response to a request from an unknown person is simply
to decline politely. </P>

<P>A third set of requests come from exactly the people you might think
would be least likely to want viruses: users of anti-virus software. They
want some way of checking that they have deployed their software correctly,
or of deliberately generating a &quot;virus incident&quot; in order to
test their corporate procedures, or of showing others in the organisation
what they would see if they were hit by a virus. </P>

<P>Obviously, there is considerable intellectual justification for testing
anti-virus software against real viruses. If you are an anti-virus vendor,
then you do this (or should do it!) before every release of your product,
in order to ensure that it really works. However, you do not (or should
not!) perform your tests in a &quot;real&quot; environment. You use (or
should use!) a secure, controlled and independent laboratory environment
within which your virus collection is maintained. </P>

<P>Using real viruses for testing in the real world is rather like setting
fire to the dustbin in your office to see whether the smoke detector is
working. Such a test will give meaningful results, but with unappealing,
unacceptable risks. </P>

<P>Since it is unacceptable for you to send out real viruses for test or
demonstration purposes, you need a file that can safely be passed around
and which is obviously non-viral, but which your anti-virus software will
react to as if it were a virus. </P>

<P>If your test file is a program, then it should also produce sensible
results if it is executed. Also, because you probably want to avoid shipping
a pseudo-viral file along with your anti-virus product, your test file
should be short and simple, so that your customers can easily create copies
of it for themselves. </P>

<P>The good news is that such a test file already exists. A number of anti-virus
researchers have already worked together to produce a file that their (and
many other) products &quot;detect&quot; as if it were a virus. Agreeing
on one file for such purposes simplifies matters for users: in the past,
most vendors had their own pseudo-viral test files which their product
would react to, but which other products would ignore. </P>

<P>This test file is known as the &quot;EICAR (European Institute for Computer
Anti-virus Research) Standard Anti-Virus Test File&quot;, and it satisifies
all the criteria listed above. It is safe to pass around, because it is
not a virus, and does not include any fragments of viral code. Most products
react to it as if it were a virus (though they typically report it with
an obvious name: Sophos SWEEP, for example, calls it &quot;EICAR-AV-Test&quot;).
</P>

<P>The file is a legitimate DOS program, and produces sensible results
when run (it prints the message &quot;EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE&quot;).
It is also short and simple -- in fact, it consists entirely of printable
ASCII characters, so that it can easily be created with a regular text
editor. Any anti-virus product which supports the EICAR test file should
&quot;detect&quot; it in any file which starts with the following 68 characters:
</P>

<PRE>X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</PRE>

<P>To keep things simple, the file uses only upper case letters, digits
and punctuation marks, and does not include spaces. The only things to
watch out for when typing in the test file are that the third character
is the capital letter &quot;O&quot;, not the digit zero, and that all 68
characters must be on one line, which must be the very first line in the
file. </P>

<P>You are encouraged to make use of the EICAR test file. If you are aware
of people who are looking for real viruses &quot;for test purposes&quot;,
bring the test file to their attention. If you are aware of people who
are discussing the possiblity of an industry-standard test file, tell them
about EICAR.COM, or point them at this article.</P>
