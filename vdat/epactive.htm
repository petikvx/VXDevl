Next Virus Carriers?</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><p></P>

<P>At the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Germany, a club member puts the
finishing touches on a new kind of virus - a virus that can seek out an
Internet user’s personal bank account information and actually transfer
funds from the account, without a personal identification or transaction
number [1]. Science fiction? Unfortunately not.</P>

<P>While only a demonstration and not an &quot;in the wild&quot; virus,
this hacker’s virus is particularly alarming for reasons that go beyond
its potentially invasive effect. First, the virus is carried by a control
developed using Microsoft Corp.’s&reg; ActiveX™, which is in growing use
on web pages throughout the world. Second, the virus loads automatically
(via the ActiveX control) as the user browses the world wide web.</P>

<P>And the Hamburg creation is no fluke. An ActiveX control called &quot;Exploder,&quot;
widely discussed in security circles, can shut down Microsoft&reg; Windows
95 and turn off your computer if it has an energy conservation BIOS. Although
this infection is more of an inconvenience than a major problem, this control
illustrates the power of these new viruses. Any type of workstation, whether
Mac, PC, Unix, or VAX, is at risk, even if you have a firewall between
your workstation and the Internet.</P>

<P>What’s more, this security breach does not seem to be limited to ActiveX.
Similar capabilities are now being attributed to Java™, a competing programming
language developed by Sun Microsystems. Application macros, Navigator plug-ins,
and Macintosh&reg; applications can also contain malicious code. This paper
specifically addresses concerns raised over offending ActiveX and Java
applets. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>How the Viruses Work</FONT></B></P>

<P>ActiveX and Java were created for web page designers to incorporate
a wide array of impressive effects on web pages, giving movement and added
dimension to the previously &quot;flat&quot; web pages. For example, the
stock prices that scroll across the bottom of your screen at some sites
or the animation that adorns an increasing number of web sites are created
using ActiveX or Java. ActiveX controls and Java applets are also behind
a host of useful applications--from developing personalized interfaces
to identifying the current version of software you are using and recommending
upgrading with downloadable software.</P>

<P>To operate properly, these ActiveX controls and Java applets need to
gain access to your hard disk. Insufficient memory and bandwidth problems
necessitate this approach. Although this desktop access provides a wealth
of beneficial applications of these controls and applets, malicious code
developers have the same access. They are now using it to read and delete
or corrupt files, access RAM, and even access files on computers attached
via a LAN.</P>

<P>For the Hamburg example above, the ActiveX control searches the user’s
hard disk for installation of Intuit’s Quicken™, popular personal financial
software actively used by more than 9 million people worldwide. Having
located the Quicken files, the control orders a transfer of funds that
is added to the software’s list of queued transfers, to be completed unbeknownst
to the user when bills are next paid [1].</P>

<P>Infections like these require the traditional definition of a virus
to be expanded. Until now, a computer virus was thought to be a malicious
code that spreads by duplicating itself via attachment to executable files,
or more recently, to text files. Here, the spread of the virus was an unwitting
consequence of actions like FTP downloading or reading attachments to e-mail.
With the new threat, viruses in ActiveX controls and Java applets can spread
with no explicit action taken by the user. Now, simply surfing the web
can be dangerous.</P>

<P>Examined with a larger view, evolution of the virus threat has mirrored
the evolution of our computing habits. Prior to the explosive use of the
Internet, viruses propagated with distribution of software programs on
floppy diskettes. Then, as software became increasingly available on line,
viruses used this medium to spread. As e-mail use increased, viruses first
appeared attached to nonexecutable files such as Microsoft&reg; Word files.
And now, as web pages become increasingly sophisticated, they are becoming
a means to spread viruses. As the desktop computer has evolved from a computing
tool to a communication tool, the virus spread has followed this shift.</P>

<P>Of the two new carriers of viruses, ActiveX is perceived to be the greater
threat because of its design. Essentially a compact version of Object Linking
and Embedding (OLE), ActiveX has direct access to native Windows calls,
linking it to any system function. And ActiveX is not limited to users
of Internet Explorer; a Netscape Navigator plug-in now available hosts
ActiveX. Java, by contrast, is &quot;sandboxed&quot; or insulated from
operating system services by the Java Virtual Machine. Nevertheless, due
to variations in Java Virtual Machine implementation, Java is gaining access
to system functions in many cases. </P>

<P>Moreover, since a Java applet can be attached to e-mail, a browser will
automatically activate the applet. In fact, both Netscape and Microsoft
are incorporating Java into their browsers, enabling applet-borne viruses
to proliferate.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Threat: Real or Imagined?</FONT></B></P>

<P>How real is this threat today? While incidents are fairly isolated at
the time of this writing, concern is growing, as security experts and users
alike begin to see a pattern of virus growth that is vaguely familiar.
During the early days of virus detection in the 1980s, experimental sites
became established that contained growing databases of viruses. This pattern
is being repeated today as various groups begin accumulating offending
ActiveX controls and Java applets. </P>

<P>And experts are beginning to speak out. Joel Snyder, writing about Java
for <U>Internet World</U> magazine, warns that &quot;the data in your files,
in your computer’s RAM, and on your LAN would be open to anyone...even
if you have a firewall. You could lose [valuable information] or see it
published on the front page of your local paper [2].&quot; Internet security
guru Edward Felten and computer security expert Gary McGraw have published
a book on <U>Java Security: Hostile Applets, Holes, and Antidotes</U> that
expounds on several security flaws in Java discovered by a Princeton University
team [3]. Writing on ActiveX for <U>IT/IS BackOffice</U> magazine, Marcus
Goncalves states &quot;Plain and simple, the Web environment needs to be
more secure,&quot; in his article entitled &quot;ActiveX: You had better
be careful [4]!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The situation is scary,&quot; says Stephen Cobb, Director of Special
Projects for the National Computer Security Association (NCSA). &quot;Enterprise
IT managers...have to set up policy now to prevent users from downloading
malicious applets and viruses.&quot;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Solutions to the Threat</FONT></B></P>

<P>Solutions to the security threat of ActiveX controls and Java applets
run the gamut of client-side and server-side options. The most obvious
client-side solution is to simply disable Java and ActiveX altogether on
user workstations. To disable Java in Netscape, for example, you select
&quot;Security Preferences&quot; from the &quot;Options&quot; menu and
click on the &quot;Disable Java&quot; box. But this solution is less than
optimal for several reasons. As users grow accustomed to the added dimensionality
of ActiveX controls and Java applets, disabling all of them frustrates
users. As these applications are increasingly applied as key components
of web pages, disabling them eliminates some applications of value to users.</P>

<P>The next step in client-based security involves Microsoft Authenticode™,
a certification system for ActiveX controls and Java applets in an upcoming
Java Development Kit (JDK). Says Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg,
Authenticode is &quot;the only commercial technology in use today that
identifies who published executable code you might download from the Internet,
and verifies that it hasn’t been altered since publication [5].&quot; </P>

<P>With Authenticode, developers of ActiveX controls or Java applets register
their software with a third party (VeriSign). For individual applicants,
VeriSign runs a screening test via Equifax, a processor of credit card
applications, and issues a Class 2 Authenticode certificate if the individual
passes the screening. For company applicants, VeriSign runs a Dunn &amp;
Bradstreet check that results in a Class 3 certificate. </P>

<P>Other firms have announced plans to provide code signing for Java applets.
JavaSoft has included digital signature capability in the Java Development
Kit, JDK 1.1, which shipped Feb. 18, 1997 [6]. Netscape Communicator plans
to include support for signed objects that make Java applet software distribution
more secure [7].</P>

<P>Although each modification to an ActiveX control or Java applet in the
wild must be re-certified with Authenticode, no checking or testing for
malicious coding is done in any of the certification processes. Hence,
the certification is not an endorsement of the code’s function or intent.
It comes down to each client choosing who they trust to produce virus-free
ActiveX controls and Java applets. This is a very difficult determination
to make, and varies by user within a company. Many users, already accustomed
to clicking &quot;continue&quot; on all warning messages they receive on
the web, will simply accept all applets and controls without regard to
the consequences.</P>

<P>From the system administrator viewpoint, these client-side solutions
have limitations and costs. Stipulations to disable ActiveX and Java are
difficult to enforce among all company users and carry more management
overhead. Authenticode places difficult decision-making on security issues
in the client’s lap, leading to inconsistent security. And virus infections
are many times more expensive to eradicate once viruses have infiltrated
the user level. These points are at the crux of the advantages of the alternative
to client-based security--server-based solutions to these threats.</P>

<P>Says analyst Ira Machefsky, writing for Giga Information Group, &quot;sites
should move to server-based security mechanisms whenever possible to save
system overhead and improve the quality and auditability of their active
component security policy [8].&quot; Indeed, server-based solutions provide
single point implementation of a security policy, which users cannot subvert
at their desktop. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>InterScan WebProtect™ and InterScan Web VirusWall™</FONT></B></P>

<P>As of this writing, the only server-based solutions that provide security
for both ActiveX and Java components are found in Trend Micro’s InterScan
family of products: WebProtect [5] for Microsoft Proxy Server and Web VirusWall™,
a component of InterScan VirusWall for Internet gateways. The web scanning
technology underlying these products is also the &quot;only blocking mechanism
that selectively filters ActiveX code from unknown sources, while letting
known vendor code pass through,&quot; according to David Willis, writing
about WebProtect for <U>Network Computing</U> [6]. WebProtect and Web VirusWall
act as a filter, blocking Java applets, uncertified ActiveX controls, FTP-
and HTTP-borne viruses, CABinet, and Win 32 portable executables. Working
with Authenticode, WebProtect and Web VirusWall enables the system administrator
to establish a companywide policy regarding acceptance of ActiveX controls
from various sources and uniformly implement this policy. At the same time,
intelligent scanning--ignoring certain file types known not to be able
to transmit viruses (e.g., GIF, JPEG, MPEG, and AVI)--ensures that there
is minimal effect on server performance and transmission speed. </P>

<P>WebProtect operates as an add-on to Microsoft Proxy Server, which administrators
can easily incorporate in a site architecture and customize to meet site-specific
needs. In its review of three client-side and three server-based solutions
to either ActiveX controls or Java applets or both, <U>Giga</U> Information
Group recommends WebProtect. &quot;All sites can benefit from Trend Micro’s
InterScan WebProtect to centrally manage Java and ActiveX security from
a proxy server [5].&quot;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Next Step</FONT></B></P>

<P>Despite the capabilities of WebProtect and Web VirusWall, more sophisticated
security is needed. These products are limited to on-off blocking options,
and to provide more flexible security, expansion of the certification process,
as well as advanced Web VirusWall-type software, will be necessary. Under
this scenario, Authenticode would not only perform basic checks on code
authors, but also provide basic information on what the code will do. For
example, if the code reads and writes certain data to the user’s hard drive,
this would be stated in the application for certification, and the certificate
would indicate these key functions of the code.</P>

<P>In parallel, an advanced version of Trend’s web scanning technology
would use emulation and rule sets to identify suspicious behavior and block
offending ActiveX and Java. WebVirusWall or WebProtect would execute the
ActiveX controls and Java applets in an isolated environment called a clean
room between the entrance to the local area network and users. This emulation
would check for malicious effects, isolated from users’ desktops. At the
same time, Trend’s software would compare the stated functions of the code
that came on the certificate with its actual activities. Using rule sets
similar to those Trend uses today in other virus protection products and
administrator input of company policies, WebProtect or Web VirusWall would
either block or pass each ActiveX control or Java applet. </P>

<P>This combination of enhanced Authenticode and advanced WebProtect-type
emulation/assimilation would balance performance with security in several
ways. First, a set of &quot;smart&quot; rules would enable quick identification
of offending codes. Further, comparison of each code with a virus database
would ferret out malicious codes without the need for rule application
and testing. This database would be maintained by adding offending codes
as they are identified. Ultimately, such a database could be part of a
security service that could replace traditional product-based antivirus
security.</P>
