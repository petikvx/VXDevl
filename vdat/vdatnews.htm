<p> <graphic 1 align=left>Now we know who wrote <a href="specialc.htm">Melissa</a>-- 
  a 30-year-old computer programmer from Aberdeen, New Jersey named David Smith. 
<p> 
<p> But the question still remains: Is David Smith the shadowy virus creator and 
  tutor who calls himself VicodinES? Recent information obtained by ZDTV shows 
  that if they aren't the same person, they're close enough to be brothers.

<p> ZDTV <b>CyberCrime</b> analyst Luke Reiter, and ZDNN reporter Joel Deane disclosed 
  on Friday that Smith and VicodinES are both linked to New Jersey Internet service 
  provider Monmouth Internet. Melissa was launched onto the Internet using an 
  IP address from Monmouth Internet. Smith was caught when that IP address was 
  tracked directly to his account, on that day. 
<p> 
<p> But as Reiter discovered, the email VicodenES used to cancel his website on 
  SourceOfKaos.com also came from an IP address assigned to Monmouth Internet. 
  Reiter and Deane lay out their case in "The Melissa Virus's Unanswered Questions." 
<p> 
<p> But there's more than just IP addresses linking Smith and VicodinES. According 
  to a 1997 <a href="ivvicodn.htm">interview</a> with on the <b><font color="#FF0000">VDAT</font></b> 
  virus zine, Smith and VicodinES share the same age, location, and pill predilections. 
<p> 
<p> In the 1997 interview, VicodinES says he loves "chocolate ice cream pops from 
  Shop Rite." Shop Rite is a large supermarket chain with stores in the mid-Atlantic 
  states, but the majority are located in New Jersey. In fact, there's a Shop 
  Rite in Smith's hometown of Aberdeen. 
<p> 
<p> In that same interview, VicodinES reveals that he got his start in computers 
  when he "was 14 or 15 and my dad purchased a TI-99 4/A... the time-frame here 
  was like 1982? Maybe a bit later." That would make VicodinES about 30 or so, 
  the same age as David Smith. 
<p> 
<p> Also, no surprise, VicodinES loves painkillers of all sorts. He took his handle 
  because "I was very high on (VicodinES) when I decided to start writing virii 
  so I thought it was appropriate." VicodinES likes all forms of painkillers. 
  Later in the interview he states, "don't think you can invite me over to your 
  house without me searching your bathroom medicine cabinet for painkillers. I 
  will steal them, you can count on that." 
<p> 
<p> According to the <b>San Francisco Chronicle</b>, David Smith has used the 
  alias "Zanax.Smith" on the Internet. Zanax, a k a Xanax, is an addictive anti-anxiety 
  tranquilizer and pain-killer. 
<p> 
<p> VicodinES and Smith also share the same profession. In 1997, VicodinES was 
  running "the MIS dept. for a large engineering firm." Smith is a contract programmer 
  for AT&T. That's not surprising, given that virus writers are likely to very 
  good at computers. 
<p> 
<p> In 1998, VicodinES left <a href="groups2.htm#TNN">The Narkotic Network</a>, 
  and joined <a href="groups1.htm#CB">CodeBreakers</a>. The FBI has seized the 
  websites of both SourceOfKaos-- which hosted VicodinES's group-- the Narkotic 
  Network, and Codebreakers. The divergent programming styles between Melissa 
  and VicodinES viruses still give some credence to the New Jersey Attorney General's 
  assertion that Smith and VicodinES are separate. 
<p> 
<p> Opic, another Codebreaker virus developer, has also been mentioned as a possible 
  Smith alias. Opic has frequently named his viruses after women, and he also 
  seems to be about 30 years old, according to a <b><font color="#FF0000">VDAT</font></b> 
  <a href="ivvicodn.htm">interview</a>. However, in that same interview Opic states 
  that he doesn't use computers in his day-job, which would make the Opic/Smith 
  connection more tenuous. 
<p> 
<p> Still, given all the similarities between Smith and VicodinES, it's likely 
  that even if they aren't the same person, they knew each other personally, rather 
  than just electronically. And since it appears that Smith built Melissa on work 
  previously done by VicodinES, that connection may be more than just casual.
