  <p>By Marcia Clark </p>
  <p>LOS ANGELES (APBnews.com) -- The scope of the devastation was astounding. 
    Casualties were reported in 80 percent of the businesses in Sweden and 70 
    percent in Germany. The parliament in London went incommunicado. Stateside, 
    80 percent of all federal agencies took direct hits. </p>
  <p>War? Not exactly. It was just one of the latest waves of computer virus attacks 
    that have struck the global networks in the past few months. Current estimates 
    make the "Love Bug" responsible for affecting literally tens of millions of 
    computers within the first two hours of its flight. The cost, measured in 
    lost productivity, has been estimated to be as much as $10 billion. </p>
  <p>And now, even as we're still cleaning up from that last attack, we're faced 
    with the new "Killer Resume" virus that began infecting and destroying computer 
    hard drives over the Memorial Day weekend. </p>
  <p>The first question that came to mind when I read of such destruction is: 
    What kind of person would go to such lengths -- and risk a prison sentence 
    -- to wreak such havoc? I pictured a wild-haired, 180 I.Q genius cyberfreak 
    with lenses thick as Coke bottles, cackling over his keyboard as he launches 
    his viral torpedoes around the globe. </p>
  <p>But Dr. Michael Maloney set me straight about the genius part right off the 
    bat. </p>
  <p>Maloney is a well-respected forensic and clinical psychologist who has spent 
    30 years examining and treating some of our strangest and most dangerous criminals, 
    including hackers. </p>
  <p><b>Rarely geniuses</b> </p>
  <p>He suggests that hackers are rarely geniuses; many are of barely average 
    intelligence. </p>
  <p>How, I wondered then, could they come up with these viruses? </p>
  <p>Imagine, he said, if you spent as much as 16 hours a day, just about every 
    day, at your computer -- don't you think you could figure out how to put some 
    pre-written codes together? </p>
  <p>Maloney was careful to avoid laying down hard-and-fast rules about the profiles 
    of the personality types at issue here, saying it was too soon to be definitive. 
    But he was able to share a number of insights on an impressionistic level 
    based on his own interviews and experience with the hackers who are facing 
    criminal charges and prison sentences. </p>
  <p><b>Undersocialized schizoids?</b> </p>
  <p>Hackers tend to be undersocialized with few connections to friends, jobs, 
    family or spouses that provide them positive reinforcement from the outside 
    world. Their computers are not only their favored source of entertainment 
    but their primary means of interpersonal contact. Except it isn't personal. 
    That's part of the problem. The awareness that there are actual people who 
    will suffer actual -- not virtual -- harm at the other end of their destructive 
    games is not real to many of these vandals. </p>
  <p>Some are high enough on the pathological scale to merit diagnosis as schizoids, 
    for whom people are all objects, even when they're standing in the same room. 
  </p>
  <p>It's hardly surprising, then, that socially isolated types more comfortable 
    with machines than people would naturally gravitate toward the virtual world 
    of cyberspace. </p>
  <p><b>Aiming for destruction</b> </p>
  <p>But why do it this way? Why not invent a cool new game or something? Why 
    aim for destruction? </p>
  <p>The answer: impact. The public impact of massively harmful Internet activities 
    is so much greater. When you become the engine of destruction for 75 percent 
    of the industrialized world, you find yourself being taken very seriously 
    by millions of people who never heard of you before, people who would never 
    have heard of you if all you'd done was dream up some spiffy new game. </p>
  <p>That need for impact is the real motivational key to these crimes, and it 
    feeds on itself. Hackers push the envelope further and further, addicted to 
    the need to see their notoriety on a grander and grander scale until they 
    finally do enough damage to get the attention of law enforcement officials 
    -- and millions of outraged computer users -- around the entire world. </p>
  <p><b>Adrenaline rush</b> </p>
  <p>The fact that they face potentially serious prison time for their digital 
    crimes doesn't deter them. In fact, they may be getting their biggest adrenaline 
    rush from the danger of what they're doing. </p>
  <p>And unfortunately, like many other authorities, Maloney believes that this 
    kind of hacking activity will only get worse. </p>
  <p>How could it be otherwise? As computers and computer networks gain in power 
    and speed, they are becoming central to the lives of ever-larger numbers of 
    people, including ever-larger numbers of social misfits. </p>
  <p><b>Why don't we defend ourselves?</b> </p>
  <p>Can the forces of good, i.e., the computer and security experts, manage to 
    keep us at least one step ahead of these cybernuts? That topic is the subject 
    of hot debate right now. But one thing's for sure: the hackers aren't going 
    away. </p>
  <p>That fact brings me to the final question I put to my renowned expert: Why 
    don't we defend ourselves better? </p>
  <p>Certainly, by now, we know enough about the dangers of opening attachments 
    and e-mail sent by persons unknown to know better. So why do people still 
    do it? </p>
  <p>We've yet to hear an answer for that one. </p>
