<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>1 INTRODUCTION </FONT></B></P>

<P>Traditionally, anti-virus scanners have only been able to disinfect
viruses that have been analysed beforehand by product developers. Around
10,000 viruses have been found during the past 10 years. So far, producers
of anti-virus products have been pretty much able to keep up with the new
viruses, adding detection and disinfection routines for most new viruses.
We can expect this situation to change in the future: when there are, say,
50,000 viruses, no vendor will be able to analyse every single virus separately.
</P>

<P>As the number of viruses keeps on growing, more and more viruses are
only detected, as the developers do not consider every virus to be important
enough to add specific disinfection routines for it. Unfortunately, some
users will eventually get infected by such a virus. </P>

<P>It is possible (but more difficult) to disinfect unknown viruses. There
are several approaches to this problem: one known method is to trace the
execution of a possibly infected program until the virus has restored the
host to its original state. This method works, but cannot be considered
truly reliable. An alternative is to emulate the program and collect information
on its execution, using this information together with generic rules to
do rule-based disinfection. Although this is difficult to implement, it
produces surprisingly good results. How many viruses can be removed this
way? Testing a generic disinfector is a very difficult task. Testing how
many particular viruses it can handle does not make sense, because it is
a generic anti-virus product. It is more important to test how many different
types of viruses we can handle by using these kinds of methods. However,
a figure of 60% is quite possible. Most anti-virus programs do not even
come close to this percentage (for example, my old program, called Pasteur).
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>2 HOW A VIRUS INFECTS A PROGRAM </FONT></B></P>

<P>Before we can talk about generic disinfection, we should understand
how a virus infects a program. In most cases, a virus adds itself to the
end of a file. If this is the case, the virus modifies the beginning of
the program to transfer control to itself. Unless the virus is very primitive,
it saves the beginning of the file within the virus code, because it will
be necessary to execute the victim file correctly after infection. This
technique is called the `appending' method. </P>

P  ODE CODE CODE CODE CODE CODE CODE CODE CODE              C</PRE>

<P><B>b. Infected program </B></P>
</UL>

<P>Every virus adds new functionalities to the victim. The infected victim
will execute the virus code, which will infect other files or system areas
or go resident in memory. After this, the virus code repairs the beginning
of the victim in memory and starts it. This sounds very simple: unfortunately,
it is that, at least from the point of view of the virus, which modifies
a few bytes in the victim file and saves a piece of the file's original
code into the virus body (in this example: `CCC'). </P>

<P>When we started to analyse viruses, there were no problems with conventional
disinfection. We had enough time to analyse them, because there were only
a few viruses. We could spend weeks with every new sample until we had
all the information necessary to clean them successfully. </P>

<P>Basically, the cleaning process is as easy as the infection. All we
need to know is: </P>

<UL>
<P>- how to find the virus (in most cases, with a search- string selected
from the virus)<BR>
- where the original beginning of the victim file (`CCC') can be found
in the virus body&lt;VR&gt; - the size of the virus in bytes. </P>
</UL>

<P>If we have all this information, we can remove the virus easily: `Let's
read the original beginning from the virus code and put it back in its
original place, then truncate the file at its original end, calculating
where this is from the virus size'. That's it! This method might have been
interesting in case of the first ten viruses, but everybody who has spent
years with viruses hates it: it is just too tedious. </P>

<P>So, we developed `goat' systems to make virus samples automatically.
These systems save time. We can calculate the place of the original bytes
in the virus body by comparing many infected samples to non-infected ones,
using a special utility. This system works as long as the virus is not
encrypted, self-mutating, or polymorphic. Of course, it must not have an
anti-goat mechanism or new infection technique which our disinfector does
not know how to handle. If one of these problems occur, we will have to
analyse the virus manually. If we are lucky, it is enough. If not, we will
have to change our anti-virus strategy by adding new functions to it, or
by modifying already existing ones. This can take a lot of time, and is
therefore not efficient enough. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3 GENERIC DECRYPTORS </FONT></B></P>

<P>Most of the better anti-virus products have a generic decryptor to combat
polymorphic viruses, so it appears we can solve the biggest problem that
way. We can decrypt the virus so we can use the old search-string technique
once again: this is great. Basically, the generic decryptor method is a
part of the generic disinfection technique. There are two different generic
decryptor methods: single-stepping (by using Int 01h, Int 03h) and emulating.
Unfortunately, each has both advantages and disadvantages. </P>

<UL>
<P><B>3.1 SINGLE-STEPPING METHOD </B></P>
</UL>

<P>Single-stepping is based on the Int 01h function. It is generated automatically
by the processor at the end of each machine instruction if the trace bit
(TF) in FLAGS is set. This is what makes the T command of DEBUG work for
single-stepping. </P>

<P>If we are using the single-stepping method, we should not develop a
processor emulator. We should not care which kind of operating system must
be emulated, because we can use the current one by calling the harmless
interrupts directly from the system. But the main question is: which interrupt
is harmless? We should also know which code is not dangerous. What can
we do if the virus is using anti- debugging techniques and we start to
execute it in a controlled way? What can we do if the virus uses an instruction
which is simply buggy on the current processor? </P>

<P>For example: the Finnpoly virus pushes its decryptor to the stack and
starts to execute it by a CALL SP instruction. This instruction works on
every Intel processor except 386DX and 386SX, where the CALL goes to offset
FFFF instead of the current value in SP register. So if we start to trace
the virus by using Int 01h on a 386 system, the virus will crash, together
with the analyser. Yes, a virus like this cannot infect our environment,
because it will not work on it. But what happens if we are scanning files
on the network in a case like this? And finally, what happens if the `controlled'
environment is buggy? In this case, the virus writer has a chance to write
a virus which can escape from the analyser; and that is where we should
stop for a second. We should not execute the virus in a controlled way,
because we cannot be 100% sure that the virus cannot escape from the analyser.
</P>

<UL>
<P><B>3.2 EMULATING METHOD </B></P>
</UL>

<P>Implementing a real processor emulator requires much more work than
using the single-stepping method. The first question: is which processor
should be emulated? If we think about it, the answer is very easy: most
good anti- virus packages will still work on an XT. Why? Because most viruses
do not use instructions from processors other than 8086, which means that
if we are developing only 286 (or higher) products we cannot find viruses
on XT. I am sure most of the developers have not seen an XT machine in
the last five years, but many people still use them: that is why we cannot
change our system fast enough. Unfortunately, some viruses need a 286 or
a 386 to work. If a virus uses 386 code, it cannot spread on an XT or on
a 286. The 286 is still a very common platform, especially in east-European
countries. </P>

<P>Thus, to summarise, we should develop an emulator which can emulate
8086, 286, and 386 code. This should be sufficient for a long time. </P>

<P>Most anti-debugging tricks are based on pre-fetch queue tricks, or on
the use of Int 01h and Int 03h. If we have an intelligent emulator, then
we do not have a big problem with such anti-debugging techniques. We can
avoid or emulate them. However, there are other problems involved with
emulating. Basically, the biggest question is: where should we stop in
the emulating process? At first glance, it does not seem too difficult.
The answer is: we should stop when we decrypt the virus. Unfortunately,
this process is quite difficult. </P>

<P>Every encrypted or polymorphic virus has a different decryptor size,
which means we need to emulate different amounts of instructions. One virus
might need 1000 instructions to be emulated and decrypted, while another
may need a few million. Virus writers understood this, so they started
to use tricks against generic decryptors and heuristic analysers. One `dirty
trick' is the use of loops before the real decryptor comes: </P>

<UL>
<PRE>1112    MOV     CX,FFFF
1115    LOOP    1115
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Let's say the analyser starts to emulate the first 2000 instructions.
If it finds some suspicious code, then it can emulate more. If the analyser
cannot recognise a loop, however, then it cannot find the virus, because
it will stop before the loop has finished and the real virus code has started.
Fortunately, good emulators can handle this situation easily. </P>

<P>There are other anti-emulating tricks which we must also be able to
handle. Every emulator stops when it recognises that the program comes
back to DOS. In the following examples, we can see that virus writers have
started to use this phenomenon in their tricks: </P>

<UL>
<PRE>CMOSDEAD.3622 virus

 011A8DBC2B01 LEA  DI,[SI+012B]
 011EB80812   MOV  AX,1208; DECREMENT SYSTEM FILE TABLE
 0121CD2F     INT  2F ; REFERENCE COUNT, but DI points
 to 12B
 0123051901   ADD  AX,0119
 01268BD0     MOV  DX,AX
 0128B9B30D   MOV  CX,0DB3
 012BB44C     MOV  AH,4C
 012DCD21     INT  21
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Int 2Fh/AX=1208 is a DOS 3+ internal function. It decrements one byte
where ES:DI points. If the emulator does not emulate this interrupt, then
it will stop its process at 012D, because it thinks the program comes back
to DOS. Here, DI points to 012B, which means that this interrupt will decrement
the byte at 012B from B4h to B3h. So the MOV AH, 4C instruction at 012B
changes to MOV BL,4C (which happens to be the `Are you there' call of this
virus). </P>

<UL>
<PRE>Letter_H.665 virus

 05E3B80035   MOV  AX,3500
 05E6CD21     INT  21
 05E88D941502 LEA  DX,[SI+0215]
 05ECB80025   MOV  AX,2500
 05EFCD21     INT  21
 05F140       INC  AX
 05F2B80000   MOV  AX,0000
 05F5F7F0     DIV  AX
 05F7B8014C   MOV  AX,4C01
 05FACD21     INT  21
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Interrupt 0h (internal hardware) is automatically called after DIV or
IDIV operations that result in error or overflow. Normally it is set by
DOS to display an error message and abort the current program. This virus
hooks Int 00h before it deliberately performs a division by zero on purpose
at 05F5h, which means it can start the full infection process from Int
00h. </P>

<P>There are many other problems with the emulating method, but it is a
much safer technique than single-stepping. Unfortunately, emulation is
slow: Users will not be pleased if they have to wait for any length of
time. It does not help to say `our product is based on emulation, please
wait a few hours', because the users will choose other, faster anti-virus
packages. A good emulator should therefore be as fast as possible: speed
is one of the most important aspects of anti-virus products from the users
point of view. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>4 HOW DOES A GENERIC DISINFECTOR WORK? </FONT></B></P>

<P>The idea of doing generic disinfection without any information on the
original file is not new; it was first developed by Frans Veldman, more
than three years ago. Unfortunately, there is only one common generic cleaner
available: TBCLEAN. The main question is: why? </P>

<P>Basically, the generic disinfection method is simple but great: the
disinfector loads the infected file and starts to emulate it until the
virus restores the infected file to its `original' form, and is ready to
execute it. So the generic disinfector can use the virus to perform the
most important part of the cleaning process. The virus has the beginning
of the original file. All we need to do is copy the cleaned program back
into the file. </P>

<P>However, there are still a few questions which have not been answered:
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>4.1 WHICH EMULATION METHOD SHOULD WE USE? </FONT></B></P>

<P>As explained above, the generic decryptor method is very similar to
generic disinfection. We should `execute' instructions only until the virus
gives control to the original program. In my opinion, emulating is much
safer. It is the only way to be 100% sure that the virus cannot escape
from the analyser. We need an intelligent emulator which can emulate and
control the `execution' of the infected program. I will demonstrate what
controlling means later. </P>

<UL>
<P><B>4.2 HOW CAN THE DISINFECTOR BE SURE THAT THE FILE IS INFECTED? </B></P>
</UL>

<P>We can use all the techniques we used for heuristic scanners. In my
opinion, a generic disinfector is a combination of a heuristic scanner
and a heuristic disinfector. This way, our disinfector will not remove
the `unknown from the unknown' [1] but will remove the virus from the unknown.
</P>

<P>The one big problem with all heuristic products is false alarms. If
the generic disinfector removes everything from the file which looks like
a virus, it might remove non-virulent code, too, and corrupt the file.
Heuristics is a science which is developing quickly, so we will find better
ways to reduce false-alarms. </P>

<UL>
<P><B>4.3 WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL END OF THE FILE? </B></P>
</UL>

<P>This question is also very important. We cannot always just remove the
part of the program that gained control; otherwise we cannot handle viruses
like One_Half. This virus modifies the body of the original program by
putting its polymorphic decryptor in 10 blocks at random into the original
file end minus 64K. (Every One_Half- infected file looks like a Swiss cheese.
See Figure 1.) In most cases, we can truncate the file to which the first
JMP points, but not with viruses like One_Half. If we truncate the file
in that position, we will remove too much, and the `disinfected' program
will not work anymore. The other problematic task is removing too few bytes
from the program: in this case, other virus scanners might find search-strings
from the file after disinfection. </P>

<P>We should collect information about the virus during emulation. That
way we can get a very good result. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>5 HOW MANY VIRUS TYPES CAN WE HANDLE THIS WAY? </FONT></B></P>

<P>There is an almost unlimited number of methods which a virus can use
to infect programs or system areas. It is true that we cannot handle all
viruses by using only generic disinfection techniques - but we can handle
most of them. </P>

<UL>
<P><B>5.1 BOOT SECTOR INFECTORS </B></P>
</UL>

<P>The PC virus problem started with a boot sector virus (Brain). Unfortunately,
it is relatively easy to write a boot sector virus. Nowadays, file viruses
outnumber boot sector viruses with a big margin: only about 5% of all viruses
infect boot sectors. So, it is not a very big problem to handle boot sector
viruses with conventional methods. However, if a new virus is found in
the wild, it is more likely to be a boot sector virus than a file infector,
because boot sector viruses are usually better spreaders. Fortunately,
most virus writers have not recognised this situation. Also, there have
been very few polymorphic boot sector viruses so far, which is fortunate,
since they are obviously much more difficult to handle. </P>

<P>We can also use generic methods to detect and disinfect boot sector
viruses. We should emulate the boot sector code as we did for files. There
are at least 12 different techniques which can be used to infect boot sectors
or Master Boot Sectors. Most of these involve saving the original boot
sector somewhere before changing the code in the boot sectors. If we can
find the virus heuristically, it is possible to locate the original boot
sector, too. In case of diskettes it can often be found at the end of the
root-directory, at the very end of the disk, or in areas marked as bad
sectors. In the case of MBR infectors, it can usually be found on the Track
0. </P>

<P>Most anti-virus products have a function for locating the original boot
record, so it is not necessary to have pre- defined information about the
disinfection. There are boot sector viruses which do not save the original
boot sector or master boot sector anywhere before infecting. In such cases,
the boot record should be overwritten with clean, generic code. </P>

<UL>
<P><B>5.2 FILE INFECTORS </B></P>
</UL>

<P>There are many more possible ways to infect files, because there are
so many different file structures. The biggest problem is the overwriting
method, in which the virus overwrites the beginning of the file with its
body, without saving the original code. Such viruses are impossible to
disinfect without information about the file structure before infection.
So, while it is not possible to disinfect viruses like this, it is easy
to detect them using heuristics. Around 10% of viruses are overwriting,
and cannot be disinfected. </P>

<P>There are also other problematic cases, such as: Windows application
infectors, device driver infectors, cluster infectors, batch file infectors,
object file infectors and macro infectors. Together, these account for
only about 1% of all viruses. </P>

<P>Several other viruses cause problems for heuristic techniques. Such
viruses use different infection techniques, with `dirty tricks' specifically
designed to make detection and disinfection with generic methods difficult.
These viruses make up to 15% of all viruses. </P>

<P>When we combine overwriting viruses and other special cases, the result
is that about 30% of all viruses cannot be handled with generic methods
easily, or at all. A listing of all infection techniques and whether or
not they are suitable to be handled by generic methods would go beyond
the scope of this paper. </P>

<P>There remains only one problem with viruses against which we can easily
use generic disinfection techniques. If the part of the virus code where
the virus repairs the infected program cannot gain control during emulation,
then the disinfector cannot get the necessary information. We should control
the `execution' of the virus code very intelligently. For example, when
the virus make its `Are you there?' call, the emulator should give the
answer the virus wants. This way, the virus thinks that its code is already
resident in memory, and repairs the host file. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>6 HEURISTIC FLAGS IN AHD </FONT></B></P>

<P>AHD (Advanced Heuristic Disinfector) is currently a test project. It
uses the generic disinfection method combined with a heuristic scanner.
These are the heuristic flags of the program: </P>

<UL>
<PRE> 1 Encryption. A code decryptor function found.
 2 Open existing file (r/w). The program opens another
   executable file for write. This flag is very common
   in viruses as well as in normal programs (like
   make.exe).
 3 Suspicious file access. Might be able to infect a
   file. AHD can give additional information about the
   virus type like, such as recursive infection
   structure (direct action).
 4 Time/Date trigger routine: this virus might have an
   activation routine.
 5 Memory-resident code. This program is a TSR.
 6 Interrupt hook. When the program hooks a critical
   interrupt, like Int 21h, we can display all the
   hooked interrupts. (Int XXh .. Int YYh)
 7 Undocumented Interrupt calls. AHD knows a lot of
   `undocumented' interrupts, so this flag will be
   displayed when the interrupt looks tricky, like the
   VSAFE/VWATCH uninstall, which is very common in
   modern viruses.
 8 Relocation in memory. The program relocates itself in
   a very tricky way.
 9 Looking for memory size. The program tries to modify
   BIOS TOP memory by overwriting the BIOS data area at
   location 0:413h.
10 Self-relocating code.
11 Code to search for files. The program tries to
   find other executable programs (*.COM,*.EXE also
   *.C“M, *.‚X‚ which means the same for DOS.)
12 Strange memory allocation.
13 Replication. This program overwrites the beginning
   of other programs.
14 Anti-debugging code.
15 Direct disk access (boot infection or damage).
16 Use of undocumented DOS features.
17 EXE/COM determinator. The program tries to check
   whether a file is a .COM or an .EXE file.
18 Program load trap.
19 CMOS access. The program tries to modify the CMOS
   data area.
20 Vector code. This is found only in viruses. The
   virus tries to use the cleaner as a vector.
</PRE>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>7 DISINFECTION EXAMPLES </FONT></B></P>

<P>Here are two examples of disinfection using AHD. In the first case,
the virus is polymorphic. It uses the original Mutation Engine (MtE). </P>

<UL>
<PRE> X:\FILEVIRS\MTE\ZEPPELIN\MOTHER.COM
 - Encrypted code
 - Self-relocating code
 - Code to search for files

</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Next, let's take a look at a disinfection where the virus is a VCL variant.
VCL (Virus Creation Laboratory) is one of the most commonly used virus-writing
toolkits. </P>

<UL>
<PRE> X:\FILEVIRS\VCL\0379\VCL379.COM

 3. Original file size: 1000 , Virus size: 379
 Virus can be removed.
</PRE>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>8 WHAT TO DO IN THE FUTURE? </FONT></B></P>

<P>We should work more on generic disinfection. It can produce surprisingly
good results. It is also necessary to develop better and better emulators.
New infection techniques emerge from time to time, such as the inserting
method. Nexiv_Der belongs in this category: this virus uses a peculiar
method of infection; tracing the execution of a victim file (using single-stepping)
and randomly inserting a call to its own code in the middle of the host.
This makes it difficult to use the emulation method on it [3]. Fortunately,
there are not too many viruses like this, but that may change in the future.
</P>

<P>In my opinion, we should test the combination of other anti-virus techniques,
too; not only heuristic scanners and generic disinfections, but generic
disinfectors and integrity checkers as well. Generic disinfection is not
a revolutionary idea, but I believe it will be one of the methods that
will keep virus scanners alive for a few more years to come. </P>
