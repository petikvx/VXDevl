<p>Below is the results of an 'unforgiven style' interview between myself and 
  Spyda. Spyda is one of a few UK virus programmers and a member of underground 
  group <a href="groups2.htm#UCSI">Ultimate Chaos</a> and writer of the excellent 
  <a href="ezines1.htm#FINALC">Final Chaos</a> zine. </p>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Give us a short description of who you are. (Handle, 
  interests, occupation, music, films, location, marital status etc.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Handle: Spyda<br>
    Interests: when on my computer; programming/coding, when outside, drinking, 
    smoking, playing pool, i have a social life so it ain't that bad :)<br>
    Ocupation: bleh !<br>
    Music: drum n bass :)<br>
    Location: Somewhere over the rainbow...</p>
  <p>D'n'B? yuk!</p>
  <p>rox0rs :P hehehe</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What made you choose your handle?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>when i first got onto the internet, i needed a handle, i went around using 
    anything i could think of for a while when i was listening to a drum n bass 
    tape with a MC called "Spider" on it, i thought he rocked and it went from 
    there :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have you ever had any previous identities in the computer 
  underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ahh. nah, none :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>When did you first get into computers?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i was about 11 or 12, i got an Atari 520 STE, but i used that for games only 
    really</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What operating system(s) are you currently running?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>at the moment, Win98SE, but i hope to have Win2k running on another box in 
    the next week or two</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How and when did you first discover the computer underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>hrmm, i started by going to alot of exploit sites, looking at real lame shit, 
    for a while thinking it still worked, then i started reading more into it 
    and actually found it interesting so i carried on digging and ended up where 
    i am now, still digging :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you first get into virus programming?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>when i joined UC i didn't code viruses, i joined UC as the graphix guy, i 
    was interested in viruses but never actually coded them, but, within a month 
    or two of me been in UC i started coding viruses</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you have an interest in the other components of 
  the computer underground? (hack/phreak/warez etc.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i find hacking interesting in terms of its ethics, and what you actually 
    can class as "hacking" but i think that recently with the massive popularity 
    of the internet, the hacking scene is starting to get clogged up with alot 
    of bullshit. i have no interest in phreaking at all. warez... no comment :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you consider yourself to be a criminal?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>nope. if people see me as a criminal, that's how they see me, not as i see 
    myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do the recent changes to virus writing law worry you?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>hrmm, yeah, they do</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Will it make you stop programmming viruses?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>well, it'll make Spyda stop coding viruses</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do your friends/family/colleagues know about your 
  interest in the computer underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>some friends do, my family don't and at the moment i have no interests or 
    reasons for telling them</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What are your opinions on virii with destructive payloads?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>depends i spose, i am mainly against them as i can't see the point in "kamikaze 
    viruses", but if they demonstrate something new (like CIH did) i spose it 
    can be beneficial to the VX scene in some ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you get involved with the virus group Ultimate 
  Chaos?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i got involved with by a string of emails sent between myself and Rhape after 
    i sent him some graphics offering to help desing the old SOK (Source of Kaos) 
    site with him</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How many people are in the Ultimate Chaos group?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>active members, i'd say 7 or 8 at the most</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do Ultimate Chaos concern themselves with virus programming 
  only?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>nope, we're stepping into the security field now</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have you been a member of any other groups?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>nope, no other groups</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What language(s) do you write viruses in?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>hrmm, i'm learning ASM and trying to learn Win32ASM, but i code alot at the 
    moment in VB and Delphi, so at the moment i've coded a couple of viruses/worms 
    in VB/Delphi</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Why did you start programmings? Was it because you 
  wanted to write viruses?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>nope, i originally started coding as a challenge to myself to see if i could 
    do it, then for a while it was a case of seeing if i could better shareware 
    programs and after that i just kinda did my own thing :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What other languages can you program in?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ASM / Win32ASM (a little) / VB / VBA / Delphi</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of viruses written in languages 
  other that assembly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>well, alot of HLL viruses have done quite well, viruses like Toadie and VBS.Freelinks, 
    so i can't say i'm against them</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What groups do you value most highly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>in the virus scene, at the moment i'd say <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a> 
    but looking back you must meantion <a href="groups2.htm#NUKE">NuKe</a> and 
    <a href="groups2.htm#PS">Phalkon Skism</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Which individual programmers to you value most highly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>virus coders past and present and in no order, MrSandman, Darkman, Rajaat, 
    CIH author, VicodinES, Dark Avenger, Opic and Vecna. big 29A influence :) 
    hehehe</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What zines do you read regularly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i read VX zines mainly, i don't normally read many other zines</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of the virus scene? (Both in general 
  and in the UK.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>there isn't much of a virus scene in the UK, as for the virus scene in general, 
    there's way too many idiots getting into the scene with a "i wanna take the 
    world over" atitude which obviously is not good</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How has the underground scene changed since you first 
  entered?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>hrmm, i haven't been in as long as some others, but i have noticed a change, 
    mainly due to the <a href="specialc.htm#MEL">Melissa incident</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think the future of virus writing holds?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i really don't know, at the moment, i see VX will always be on top of AV, 
    i can't see that changing at the moment either</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you believe in a 'perfect virus'? And if so describe 
  it.</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No, i don't think there can be a perfect virus. In order for it to be perfect, 
    it must be perfect in everyone's eyes, and i can never see an infected user 
    thinking that the virus that just infected their system is perfect</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What advice would you give to newbies entering the 
  virus scene?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>read the #virus FAQ (<a href="http://www.coderz.net/virus">http://www.coderz.net/virus</a>) 
    if you have any intentions of joining virus, just so you don't ask stupid 
    questions</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What language(s) do you think newbies should start 
  writing viruses in?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i really think it is up to the person, purists would say ASM/Win32ASM but 
    i really do believe if you're good at a certain language, stick with it, just 
    look at Bubbleboy, that wasn't coded in ASM...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Any greets/thankyous?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>yeah, greets (in no order) too: Rhape79, PaX, MidNyte, Gigabyte, Clau, Evul, 
    MrSandman, Darkman, peon, BSL4, Phage, Tally, Zulu, HomeS|ice, Del_Armg0, 
    ProGen, Infra Red and DarKPaiN hehehe</p>
