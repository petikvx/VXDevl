<P><b><font color="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> When i was 10 my brother was making his career, and my parents bought him 
    a "powerful" 386 40Mhz with 8 megs of RAM (well, in 1992 it was cool). He 
    told me how to initialize games, and such like. I really enjoyed the time 
    i was in front of the computer, so 4 years ago i asked to my parents for a 
    computer. And here i am :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I'm little time in the scene... About one year interested, and half year 
    researching. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would you like 
  to take credit for? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have only 100% finished the Antichrist Superstar, and i have very advanced 
    other much more cool projects. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Generally the name is related to a punk/metal/hardcore song that i like. 
    But there is a exception. I'm making one virus called "Emision Pirata", that 
    it's a spanish radio program. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> BASIC :) PAS and ASM. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I love the PASCAL structure, but i find assembly much more useful for my 
    needs. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Fuck yeah. I'm member of <a href="GROUPS1.HTM#DDT">DDT ViRUS STUDiOS</a> 
    (shortened to DDT). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like AVP, but i respect a lot the AVs coded by independent coders for 
    his own (or his friends) needs without asking for money. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My goals are to make the people change his viewpoint of what a virus is. 
    But it's an impossible goal. They must understand the meaning of a virus, 
    and the idea that the author has while making it. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Is there a war? I think that the only thing the VX do is avoid all the walls 
    that AV tries to make. And we are learning from this. The AV is interested 
    in make people believe that there is a war: they wannabe the "John Wayne" 
    of the film, and they say that we are like the man that is killing people 
    or something :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I went to see a film in the cinema called "Con Air" with my friend zAxOn. 
    In the film appears a guy (a bad guy), called Billy Belcebú, a mass killer. 
    I think "this nick sounds good for me" and here i am. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> There're good virus creators, and there are VERY bad ones. The <a href="CREATRS1.HTM#IVP">IVP</a> 
    (yuck!), <a href="CREATRS2.HTM#VCL">VCL</a>, <a href="CREATRS2.HTM#NRLG">NRLG</a> 
    and such like were very lame... I made my first steps looking to the sources 
    generated by virus generators. And that is its usage: they're useful for learn. 
    But i don't like the niggas that put his name and are saying "I made a virus, 
    i'm very intelligent". </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't believe that the macro viruses are the solution. Microsoft can remove 
    macro support if they like, and the world will be the same. As GriYo said, 
    a computer can't run without an OS :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No, i don't use to distribute them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Most - <a href="EZINES1.HTM#VLAD">VLAD</a>. Least - <a href="EZINES1.HTM#DHC">DHC</a> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I really like the GriYo's style, and i respect all the people who is always 
    researching for new ways of infection and such like. I also respect zAxOn, 
    because he taugth (and introduced) me in the VX world. I like <a href="GROUPS1.HTM#29A">29A</a>, 
    <a href="GROUPS1.HTM#IKX">iKX</a> and <a href="GROUPS2.HTM#VLAD">VLAD</a>, 
    and i respect all others (except the ones all we know :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">In the AV world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't know anyone in the AV side, so i can respect anybody i don't know. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like individually to Che Guevara (he isn't in computer world but it still 
    rocks :). Group? Legion of Doom (the classics in hacking!) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't like them. Just think that the data you want to destroy could be 
    yours. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Nope. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> real life? What's that? :) I go to the damned school 7/8 hours in a day, 
    and i really enjoy the time i'm with my friends. I also enjoy a cold beer, 
    preety girls and such like. I'm always listening music. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, 
  girlfriend etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My parents know it, but they don't believe me. They think this is a thing 
    that i'm saying for feel superior or something. A little group of friends 
    know it (and about all of them are from DDT! :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking, 
  phreaking, warez etc.)? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Not too often. I like warez, but i use to call friends when i need a program. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Fuck NO! Viruses musn't be illegal. They're a kind of art. Yes, there is 
    a difference: i create viruses for my own satisfaction, and not for infect 
    people with them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> An intelligent one: must avoid existing/future AV, hide all kinda symptoms 
    of infection, NOT DESTRUCTIVE, must analyze all files before infecting them 
    in order to see if there is "dangerous" code for virus life... the perfect 
    virus is impossible to do but it's good to try to do something alike. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>What is your view on Windows (95/98) </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yuck! MicroBlowz fucks me, but i know this is (ouch!) the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Be patient. Ask to the people of #virus channel in your favourite channel 
    for doubts, download good ttutorials about this matter and don't give up! 
    You're now in where we all were sometime ago. And don't hear the people that 
    laughs with your questions. </p>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">How did DDT start? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It started in the middle of 1997 as a very young group, made by four friends 
    (zAxOn, frontis, Johnny Mnemonic and me). Johnny didn't pay attention to our 
    projects so we kicked him from DDT :) We weren't known until october 1998, 
    when zAxOn and me connected to internet. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How is DDT organized? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, we are all friends. I'm the main organizer (kinda boss) and zAxOn 
    is my vicepresident. We hear all the thoughts, we think that we are all equal, 
    but there must be someone for organize all our material and such like. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </font></b></P>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">Any info on the zine and virus creator you are about 
  to release? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> About the zine i can say that we are collecting material: viruses, disassemblies, 
    virus related articles and such like. I have to say that if someone want to 
    contribute with a virus, or an article, feel free to mail me. The zine will 
    be called... guess how? yeah, DDT magazine :) About the virus creator i can 
    say that we have it almost finished, but we must solve the CRT pro- blem in 
    Pentium II (the creator is made in PAS). It won't have destructive payloads, 
    and the viruses will be fully commented. It was developed for help ppl that 
    wanna learn. It will have polymorphism, tunneling, retro, anti-heuristic trick, 
    anti-debugging stuff, anti-bait tecniques and some more surprises. </p>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">Any greets? </font></b></P>
