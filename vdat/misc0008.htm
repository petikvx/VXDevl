<P>Shrinking the Windows 95 interface to pocket size seems certain to make
HPC's a hit with users. But in bringing desktop functionality - and the
core of the Win32 API - to a handheld platform, Microsoft may have brought
some desktop vulnerabilities as well. For example, how difficult would
it be to write a Windows CE virus? </P>

<P>&quot;That's an excellent question,&quot; replies Mark Vena, director
of options and communications for Compaq's North American PC products group.
Unfortunately, like most industry sources we asked, he doesn't know the
answer. </P>

<P>&quot;This is the first I have heard of it,&quot; says Daryl Scott,
Casio's manager of development marketing, who says the issue of viruses
never came up during development of the firm's Cassiopeia HPC. &quot;If
[Windows CE] has all the benefits of the Windows 95 interface,&quot; Scott
adds, &quot;I imagine it has all of the weaknesses.&quot; </P>

<P>Microsoft consedes that a virus could be written for Windows CE, but
says the threat is minimal: &quot;I am sure people will cause trouble,
but there is not much we can do about that,&quot; says Jon Magill, director
of marketing for consumer appliances. Magill maintains that Microsoft has
taken the same precautions with Windows CE that it took with its desktop
environments. </P>

<P>&quot;The good news is that this is a ROM-based system,&quot; which
makes it difficult for it to become infected, Magill points out. Of course,
viruses could travel via e-mail attachments of PC file transfers such as
game downloads, but Magill is unconcerned: &quot;We can't be worried about
that. We have to focus on enabling people.&quot; </P>

<P>With HPC's just starting to ship at press time, there were no reports
of CE-based viruses, but &quot;it is definitely possible to write one,&quot;
says Louis Casal, a product manager at Symantec Corp. </P>

<P>According to Chris Harget, a spokesperson for McAfee Associates, it's
not unusual for a new operating system to be launched without any native
antivirus support. &quot;Nobody writes an antivirus solution until they
see a live specimen,&quot; he says. &quot;There are just too many variables.&quot;
</P>

<P>The potential threat, says Harget, depends on how Windows CE is perceived
by malicious programmers. &quot;When Windows 95 came out, it was a huge
white elephant for virus writers,&quot; he notes. &quot;It really depends
on whether they care about the platform.&quot; </P>

<P>Magill says concern about Windows CE viruses is unfounded: &quot;How
many Newton-based viruses have you seen?&quot; </P>
