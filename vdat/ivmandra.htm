<p class="Boldblue"><b><font color="#004080">How did you start out in computers? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> When i was 7, i had a CPC 6128. I was playing a lot, and copying listings. 
    I've began to crack some z80 gamez at 9 with discology :) I'm still cracking 
    z80 games, just for me and the phun. Later i had a 386 and i started x86 coding 
    with asm. i'm a warrior. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in 
  the virus scene? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've always been interested by viruses, maybe a kind of destiny ... Once, 
    when i was young, i said to a girl at school that i wrote a virus, but it 
    wasn't true. I felt bad after, and wanted to correct that. Then i started 
    to code instead of decoding, and my first virus was 3 years ago. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so 
  which would you like to take credit for? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Not so many: each time i'm learning something, or exploring some old, hidden, 
    dark and forgotten DOS structures. It can take a lot of time.... and i'm trying 
    to have a social life :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I'm trying to find something meaningful each time, from Cthulu myth to Tolkien's 
    folklore, and sometimes from a world event. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you 
  know? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> ASM iz my best, but i know a bit of C++ and Pascal. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you 
  like using the most? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> ASM of course. You can nearly do anything. It's really flexible. Learn ASM 
    and you don't need anything else. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've been in <a href="groups1.htm#INV">Invaders</a>, and now i'm in <a href="groups1.htm#DDT">DDT</a> 
    . </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect 
  the most? Which the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've been disappointed by each of them, and I don't have any respect for 
    them... But i can say that i can't bear f-prot, mcafee products, and NAV. 
    Most of the time i'm working w/ AVP and DrWeb. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I would have some virii in the wild, and be a better coder. But i'm working 
    on :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 
  'war' between VX and AV. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Really ? i don't care. They do their commercial job, and they let us work 
    to feed them. We've got though a close relation, and like a couple there's 
    some problems sometimes... </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What 
  does it mean? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> hehe mandragore is a french word. It's a magic root, used in lots of tells. 
    At first, i like to be root everywhere... and it contains some narcotics :)~ 
    From a magical point of view, it can be used to make love potions, it brings 
    you wealth, but misfortune in the same time. It makes the women more fertile. 
    It can be used in invisible potion too. It's mainly german folklore. It's 
    a CPC game too. My nick comes from all that. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation 
  software (eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It's a good job to do, but a crappy thing to use. I've saw too many virii 
    made with this tools. Many lamerz clame to be virus writer, but they don't 
    even know what asm is. Coding is like a martial art : you learn to kill only 
    when you can control it. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses 
  vs. assembly or HLL viruses? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> For me, macro viruses was something ridiculous a few time ago. But i must 
    admit that nowaday, it's a real art and it must be considerated. They're spread 
    really fast, and everywhere! I don't understand (yet?) the advantage to code 
    using HLL. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your 
  viruses 'in-the-wild'? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> never :( but i don't spread it myself. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? 
  Which the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I love <a href="ezines1.htm#XINE">xine</a> because it has a hack part, <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</a> 
    issues for the quality, and <a href="ezines1.htm#VXU">vx united</a> for the 
    (good) idea. I don't hate any particular e-zine, just the lame ones using 
    only HLL, with old stuff, or ripped from a better one. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do 
  you like/respect in the VX world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a>, even if it contains some arrogant 
    persons, but nobody'z perfect :P <a href="groups1.htm#IKX">IKX</a> is a good 
    group according to me, <a href="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</a> too, and FS contains 
    lots of good members: i'm waiting good stuff from them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">In the AV world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I really don't care of the AV world. I've just only one thing to say : McAfee 
    iz the Bill Gates of AV products. Nothing more, nothing less. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do 
  you like/respect outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like Nitrophusion, it's a group of friends (greets to darky, cleaner, 
    ...). I admire the x86.org job against intel, UCF, and many other... </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on destructive 
  payloads in viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It suxx, and most of the time it decreases the spread rate. Where's the 
    beauty? the hard part? what's the goal? only mad ppl destroy freely. You can 
    crash a medical server, or an airport. Those viruses can kill in real. It's 
    a murder. If someone kills my HD, i'll kill him! </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing 
  as a 'good' virus? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I feel really well when i finish a new virii, cause i've learned a lot of 
    things. I'm a better coder, each time. It's a good feeling, and a bad too 
    : we have to be humble to progress. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've just missed some scientific exams, then i don't really know yet... 
    I'll certainly work in networks business or something like that. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know 
  what you do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My parents don't really understand what i do, for them i'm computing...<BR>
    My girlfriend doesn't care, she has some personnal problems w/ my computer 
    :)<BR>
    My freinds... hmm i dunno in fact. They know what i do, but they're just a 
    bit afraid when i give zem something :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside 
  VX (Hacking, phreaking, warez etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've always been interested about hpcav since local BBSing, and later being 
    cosysop. I never had some real hacking results, i don't take the time to progress, 
    but it helps me to understand what i do, what's happening. That's why i've 
    began to disasm on my CPC, becoming later a vxer. I tryied to phreak too, 
    but i don't have enough electronical skillz. Phreaking is highly prohibited 
    here (france).<BR>
    Warez ? I'm for the freedom of information, but i'm not a trader. I just can't 
    bear thoses lame kids trading some .cab :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there 
  a difference between creation and spreading? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I must admit : it's a rape, but the computer is agree. Mine is 18+ :)) Creating 
    is something really different than spreading, it's improving, but spreading 
    can be funny or usefull. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> You already have it. But you don't know... It's an impossible virus to catch, 
    it's so stealthy than you cannot guess that's here. none payload, fast spreading, 
    compatible for a long time. </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95/98) 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> sssssssshhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttt Necro$oft brings us the power 
    of yesterdays computers today </p>
</blockquote>
<P class="Boldblue"> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just 
  starting out? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Be patience, work a lot, make your own work whatever one may say. Enjoy 
    what you do, only motivated persons do something. </p>
