<P>Trigger is one of our [<A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A>] coolest
members, not only in the way he codes, but more in the way he acts/talks.
We met about 5 months ago on Internet, and since then we are very good
friends. Besides being cool (hehe), he's also from .nl ;)<BR>
Here is an interview we did some time ago... </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hi Trigger, let me first give you an opportunity
to introduce yourself - to those who don't know you. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hi, I'm Trigger, born somewhere in the seventies and resident in The
Netherlands. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why 'Trigger' ? Does it mean something? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Errm.. At some time I wanted a new handle, and I wanted it to sound
kinda dangerous. I read in some virus article the verb 'to trigger', and
I decided I'd use that as a handle, regarding the parallel with the 'trigger'
of a gun, which can be kinda dangerous. :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What was your first computer related experience?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>When I was 8 or something, my dad got us an Atari 2600. I was hooked.
After that, we got some kind of Sharp homecomputer (MZ-800), which had
BASIC, but (even then) that couldn't really get my attention. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What was your first virus related experience?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>After the Sharp homecomputer we got ourselves an 8 MHz XT, and of course,
we used tons of pirated software. (TestDrive, Larry 1, ahh the good old
days :)) Then, one day, I was scanning my 20 Mb HDD, and McAfee found Yankee
Doodle. McAfee cleaned it up, so no big deal. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you start out messing around with
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>About 5 or 6 years ago, I bought a modem (fascinated by the movie Wargames),
and got involved in the BBS-scene. First I did some warez, then I did some
phreaking, and then BBSes had to make place for the Internet. At the time,
I really liked the idea of a world-wide but small scene, which I recognized
in the virus scene. I had always been a bit interested in those viruses,
so I decided to become a virus writer. I downloaded all <A HREF="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40Hex</A>
and <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> magz, and started reading my ass
off. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What have you done for the virus scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nothing much so far, really. :) I decided I didn't want to bring out
stuff that was already done by zillions of other people. I've been more
busy educating myself than trying to finish something with which I could
contribute to the scene in some sort of way. But when I was starting out
with polymorphism, I couldn't find any really clear articles on how to
write such a thing. Et voila, that would be my first contribution, <A HREF="tupoleng.htm">an
idiot's guide to writing polymorphic engines</A>, which is included in
this issue of <A HREF="ezines1.htm#SLAM">SLAM (#4)</A>. Currently, I'm
really busy with the rest of my life, but one day I'll finish my MadCow
Virus, which is an OldExe infector, with all neat (standard) DOS techniques.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in Real Life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nothing much, really. :) No just kidding, I'm in my final year of school
now, and I'm busy with my own company; I design promotional stuff, like
flyers for parties, but also campaigns for political parties and stuff.
I also have quite a busy social life, and most of my friends don't know
shits about computers. I find both quite hard to combine, and most of the
time, I choose social life before my computer, which I think is a healthy
choice. :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How have viruses affected your real life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Apart from valuable time they consume, very little. People around me
who do know something about computers are already happy with knowing what
dir/w means, so I can't really 'share' my interests in viruses. Their loss
:) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion on virus generators? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have never taken a serious look at any of them, but I think it's clear
that the challenge is to write one, not to use one. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about polymorphic engines? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Almost the same answer. Using an existing engine is addmittedly a bit
harder than using a virus generator, but it's still lazy and moreover quite
stupid. It's far more efficient to write your own engine. Once you know
how to do it, it's really simple. Read my tute! :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your favourite virus/virus generator/polymorphic
engine? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think Natas by Priest is my personal favourite virus. For the vir
<A HREF="creators.htm">generators</A>, I never took a serious look at any
of them, and for the <A HREF="enginmen.htm">poly engines</A>, I think <A HREF="engine2.htm#TPE">TPE</A>,
considering the time it came out. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you feel about the virus scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I wish I was involved in the <A HREF="groups2.htm#PS">P/S</A>, <A HREF="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">TridenT</A>
and <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> days, but looking back always makes
the past look better. 29A have released a fine second issue, which is,
in my opinion (and especially in theirs :)) important for the scene as
it 'exits the old-skool, into the new'. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion on the AV community? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, unfortunately, I hardly have time to keep up with the VX community,
so keeping up with AV (the information they spread, not their techniques)
is too much for me. However, things in the VX community are changing at
the moment (dos/win32), and I think this can also be noticed in the AV
scene. </P>
</UL>

<P><B>What is your favourite AV product? </B></P>

<UL>
<P>I actually don't really use any, except for VX purposes. To decide which
is the best, I'd have to say that best is to use a couple of them next
to eachother for the best results. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you believe in 'the perfect virus' and if
so, describe it. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. A perfect virus would be familiar with all platforms and OSes,
and would adapt to any new platform/OS it encounters. It would change not
only it's exterior (it's actual code) but also it's interior (not only
structure, but also targets, techniques, etc.) on every infection. It would
make itself run on any computer it comes across, and it would find ways
to spread itself by making use of all equipment connected to the computer.
Eventually, the author of the virus realizes he should have built in some
social and moral values, which would prevent the virus from using sick
spreading techniques like brainwashing people through their SoundBlasters,
but alas, it's too late. The virus doesn't have an off-switch, so inevitably
it continues gaining power until it takes over the world. When it has,
it will create its own intelligent breed, exterminating the inferior mankind.
</P>

<P>This was just -a- perfect virus. :) </P>

<P>-The- perfect virus would learn itself (or would have been taught) some
moral and social values, would realize the uselessness of its existence,
and would eventually commit suicide, hoping all other derivatives come
to the same insight. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you feel about destructive viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's changing now, but back in the DOS-only days, viruses had to be
as small as possible, operating at a level as low as possible. With these
two together it's almost inevitable that bugs are introduced, which (at
such a low level) can cause the most disastrous crashes. I believe a large
part of the 'destruction' is done by such bugs and incompatibilities. But
to answer your question, I think intentional destruction is stupid, as
it delays or even stops the spreading process. Furthermore, it gives virus
authors a bad name. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is/was in your opinion the best virus
group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Phalcon/Skism and VLAD did some great stuff, and currently <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A>
is becoming the world-leading virus group. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about SLAM? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>SLAM has talented coders too (wide smile), but we're not the 'best'
group around. Yet. :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Is there anything you would like to say? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yep, there's an ancient Dutch saying (okay not ancient, but pretty old),
which in my opinion says it all to some virus writers. </P>
</UL>

<UL>
<P>That is left as an exercise to the reader :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Everyone I know: hi :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Thanks for this interview. See ya </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sure.. Laterz.. </P>
