  Might/DVC</font><br>
  <font size="+1">by jackie twoflower </font></b><br>
  [June 1999]</font></P>
<hr>
<P> For our first issue and also first interview, I interviewed Might of <a href="groups1.htm#DUVC">DVC</a>. 
  Might is one of my best friends so "Heya Might!" So ehmm...some questions were 
  stolen, so ehmm...sorry next time it will be better...;) </P>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">When was your first contact with computers? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I got a computer in 1994. A 486 dx2 66 Mhz. It was a real piece of trash. 
    Nothing worked correctly, so I started investigating the computer. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What brought you into the VX scene? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> First I wanted to be a virus collector. So I collected virii, but I found 
    them interesting so I was searching for tut's. I found them and read 'em And 
    that's how I think I started. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Did you already wrote a virus? Any credits for them? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have written 2 virii. A com overwriter and a com appender. Easy virii 
    So I will take credit for it, but it isn't good. Right know I am working on 
    exe and tsr virii. That are virii I want to take credit for (i hope) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? Have you any special 
  technic? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, I name them after a girlfriend (at least the 2 I made) but my next 
    virii will be better named. Something what pops up into my head when watching 
    a kewl movie or something. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembler and a bit perl </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your favourite programming language? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembler I think </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, I am the founder of the DVC and a member of UC </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Don't know very much about it but I do know that if we don't get more virii 
    writers and better virii we might lose. Hell, what am I talking about. Always 
    be positive :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, first I was wondering if I should name myself The Mighty Solid or 
    The Mighty one. I typed The Mighty one in on irc and what happened? It was 
    to long. It was The_Might and I liked it. First I thought it didn't mean shit, 
    but then I heard that it meant: The power or something like that </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you think about creation kits? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, it is fun to check out, but you can't call the virii you make YOUR 
    virii. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are there any of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No. but some of my future virii will definately be! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </b></font> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, a couple. Immortal riot is good, UC is good and much more Too much 
    to name. The individual that I most respect is probably rajaat </p>

<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads? </font></b> 
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well, I think destruvtive payloads kewl. I know some don't, but hell, otherwise 
    no one would fear them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </font></b> </P>

</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents,

<P><b><font color="#004080"> What else you have to say or any other comments? 
  </font></b> </P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Not really :) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Tell me something about DVC and it's members? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well DVC means Dutch Virii Community. Almost all our members are newbie 
    but we have very good persons too. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are DVC's goals? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> We want to give newbies the opportunity to join a group, so they have more 
    motivation on making virii. They have to go to some sort of "test" I want 
    to see some virii of them, but it is mostly good :-) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How is DVC organized? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> We have a couple of "founders" but thet have no higher rank then the members. 
    I am the only leader, but I don't play leader. The members can do what they 
    wanna do </p>
