<b><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">TAIPEI--A Taiwan technology 
firm keen to test its own hardware has hired the super-hacker who created the 
notorious Chernobyl virus--which laid waste to hundreds of thousands of computers 
worldwide in April.</font></b> 
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">Wahoo International Enterprise 
  said it recently fought off a score of high-tech rivals competing to lure Chen 
  Ing-hau after the 24-year-old completed Taiwan's mandatory military service. 
  </font>
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">A remorseful Chen admitted 
  he wrote the stealthy computer program during his tour of military duty, and 
  was arrested in April but soon released because no complaints were filed in 
  Taiwan. </font>
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">The virus, also known as CIH, 
  wipes out an infected computer's hard drive data every April 26--the anniversary 
  of the 1986 Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, Ukraine. </font>
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">Chen's rogue program hit hardest 
  in countries with weak antivirus defenses, gumming up hundreds of thousands 
  of computers in South Korea, Turkey, China, India and elsewhere. "Our chairman 
  felt he was a rare computer professional and we decided to accept him with an 
  open heart,'' said Wahoo spokeswoman Vivi Wang. </font>
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">Chen works in Wahoo's hardware 
  testing department, she said. </font>
<p><font face="geneva, arial, helvetica" size="-1">Wahoo, which makes multilingual 
  Linux operating systems, has said it plans to list its U.S. arm, XLinux.com, 
  on the Nasdaq stock market by June 2000. </font>
