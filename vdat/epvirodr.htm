<TD>It is an argument on substance over appearance. But it is an argument
which the technical community - at least within itself - does not welcome.
What makes an anti-virus product? What is its substance - and what should
be its appearance? 
<P>Let's go back a while. In the early days, the majority of computer viruses
were DOS-based and ran on PCs. And the majority of PCs were standalone
- and even those which were connected were (mostly) connected only to a
few others in an office. This is, perhaps, why boot sector viruses were
the most common viruses, because diskettes were the most common way of
sending and receiving information and programs. </P>

<P>In the very early days, most people didn't even believe in viruses.
One notable figure said most virus incidents were an urban myth like alligators
in New York's sewers! In those days, you expected to have a discrete program
to resolve a particular problem. So to detect a virus, you executed another
program which searched for it and - if you were lucky - found it. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Such a program needed to show that it was doing something. After all,
if you produce a remedy for a problem which lots of people believe don't
exist, and if the solution doesn't actually find anything most of the time
(by design or accident), you do at least need to convince your customers
that something is really happening. So these early programs put up some
cludgy display which showed that something was taking place. 
<P><B>But soon that was not enough.</B> </P>

<P>Soon people wanted a proper interface - with menus and options. Something
that was in keeping and in character with what was happening in the rest
of the computer industry. While there was little advancement for some time
in the science of virus detection, the development of interfaces progressed
vigorously. </P>

<P>Then you have the interruption of Windows - which allowed even more
attractive and interactive interfaces. Drop down menus and press buttons
became the norm while progress bars filled comfortingly - and not always
with any close relationship to what was actually happening on the virus
scan. </P>

<TD>The Windows experience could be written off as a marketing adventure
if it were not for one important fact. Windows allows you to employ a virtual
device driver - a fact not immediately spotted by anti-virus companies.
The device driver solved a big problem for developers - the problem of
memory. </TD>

<TD>Anti-virus developers had already realised that lots of users won't
run anti-virus products routinely. However, if you have a memory-resident
product it - in theory - will detect any virus which happens to stray into
your computer while you are working. 
<P>This was a big step forward and it gave much better virus protection
except for the fact that memory was limited and therefore the protection
offered was limited. Developers were forced to compromise but fortunately
for most developers, most magazine reviewers were incapable of testing
memory resident virus programs. </P>

<P>With virtual device drivers (VxD), developers at last had access to
as much memory - once again in theory - as they needed. This meant that
their memory resident programs had approximately the same protection as
their main scanner (although in one or two cases this did not mean a great
deal). </P>

<TD>Soon and while some of what we have already been talking about was
going on, PCs stopped being personal and became workstations. The great
connectivity rush was on and immediately anti-virus developers scented
gold in them thar cables and on them thar fileservers. 
<P>The spread of viruses on networks was potentially a great problem. Actually
it was only a great problem because lots of networks had been set up without
using the security that was built into the operating system. Accordingly
viruses which shouldn't have spread through organizations did. Anti-virus
developers responded by producing special versions of their product to
run on fileservers. </P>

<P>But the main problem that networks solved was the problem of updating
the anti-virus product. </P>

<TR>
<TD>There was a great debate (now long forgotten) over how to protect against
viruses. Some people wanted a solution which you could fit and forget.
But the most popular anti-virus products were virus scanners. And scanners
unfortunately required regular updating which pushed a huge burden on to
MIS departments. 
<P>Networks gave people the remedy. You could update your anti-virus software
by running a login script or calling a small program and downloading the
update of the fileserver. Of course it did nothing for the standalone PCs
which is why - although Christmas came early for the networks - it was
not what you could call a complete solution. </P>

</FONT></FONT><BR>
</P></CENTER>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Someone, probably Christopher Columbus, discovered the Internet. We
went through the now familiar routine of recognising what a serious threat
this was and how viruses were waiting just behind the modems to tiptoe
on to our computers. It didn't stop people from connecting though. 
<P>When people began to get comfortable with the fact that there were viruses
out there some bright spark realised that if the Net was good enough for
virus authors, it was good enough for anti-virus developers. Soon update
buttons started to appear on the interfaces (yes, we still have those)
which let people automatically update their software via the Internet.
</P>

<P><B>So far so good - we're almost up to date.</B> </P>

<P>The next step is just starting to happen. Anti-virus developers are
experimenting with putting their solutions on the Net so that instead of
downloading your solution you simply run the virus scanner straight ff
the Web. You don't have to worry about updating it - the anti-virus developer
is doing that with far greater (in theory) frequency - perhaps daily instead
of what you have at best been getting till now: routine updates monthly.

<TD>I'd like it to be - if only so that I can take a break. The above scenario
is going to be OK for home users and users in small offices. It will also
be OK in countries like the US where access to the Internet via a local
free call is possible. In countries where the telecomms companies charge
and where the telecomms is not so well developed as it is in the US, with
slow transmission rates (yawn) - the solution will be less well received.

<P>If you work in the MIS department of a corporation, the idea of individuals
accessing the Net may be as popular as a waiter with a runny nose. In addition,
you really don't want your users thinking about viruses - they only panic
and start calling everyone including their maiden aunt in Michigan to tell
them about it. </P>

<P>What you really want - in theory - is for viruses to be detected without
the user being aware of it (has to be memory resident); the virus problem
should be solved (if possible, automatically again, without the user being
aware) and the MIS department should receive a report - from the anti-virus
solution, not the user (has to be on a network). </P>

<P><B>Now we're close to having all of this right now. So what's the problem?</B>
</P>

<P>The problem is what about new viruses! While all of the above was happening,
some really thoughtful person invented macro viruses. Macro viruses spread
like wildfire because while relatively few people send computer programs
and diskettes about these days, everybody and his dog send each other email
and documents attached to them - and the Internet is positively dripping
with documents for download. Hence macro virus infected documents are sloshing
around with far greater frequency than conventional viruses. </P>

<P>Put macro viruses, networks and the Internet together and you have the
ingredients for a glut of viruses which could threaten the ability of conventional
systems to discover and build in protection to existing products without
a big delay. Increasingly, customers will look for a real time solution.

<TR>
<TD>I'd like to have an anti-virus solution which delivered the remedy
as soon as I've got the need for it - this is a convention that has been
adopted in other walks of life. It is called &quot;just in time&quot;.
Although anti-virus developers have been doing something like this for
a while - with a mechanism for updating their products for new viruses
which users could download from a bulletin board or CompuServe or their
Web site - it's not quite the sophisticated system that I have in mind;
it is also heavily reliant on user intervention. 
<P>What I am looking to do is to recognize that, as with many other aspects
of computing, we are moving from the simple box product to a service. </P>

<P>There are many questions that have yet to be argued through - for example
what do you do if you encounter a new virus on your machine? Well actually
the question is how do you know? </P>

<P>These questions are for another time. Right now, I want to leave you
with an ideal - it's not one which can be delivered tomorrow but it has
many benefits for both developers and users. The ideal is that users don't
have to worry about viruses, they simply get on with using their PCs for
what they were intended for - meanwhile in the background someone else
is taking care of the problem. </P>

<P>There will be many people who would disagree with this point of view.
The people at &quot;antivirus online&quot; encourage you to write in and
let us know what you think. </P>
