  <p align="center"><b><font color="#FF8040">As of this release of VDAT (2.000.1) 
    this is one of the few sections you will be able to access without a proper 
    key file.</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"> As many of you will have noticed I have decided to be less 
    generous with the supply of VDAT. VDAT 2.000.0 was the last <font color="#FF8040"><b>PUBLIC</b></font> 
    release, any subsequent releases will limited to insiders only. As of this 
    release the access to the ZIP file will be &quot;per request&quot; only. Passing 
    the specific URL around will not help since VDAT will be &quot;secured&quot; 
    with a key file. Specific &quot;insiders&quot; will be granted access and 
    a key file to VDAT updates. This key file will change with every subsequent 
    release of VDAT. I know this key file might even become a trading item and 
    there is no way I can prevent that. When and if I think all of this is gettig 
    too much of a hassle I will stop releasing VDAT all together.</p>
  <p align="left">The following is a list of virus related material that I know 
    exists but is not yet part of my collection. People supplying me with something 
    of this list will be given access and a key file to VDAT. </p>
  <p align="center">!! Everything will be handled on a &quot;first come, first 
    serve&quot; basis, key files will only be issued once for a specific item 
    from the &quot;Wanted&quot; list.!!</p>
  <p align="left">For those with access to VDAT and with access to something from 
    the list other &quot;trades&quot; can be arranged. For more information about 
    donating material contact me at <a href="mailto:cicatrix@worldmail.nl?subject=VDAT%20Referred">cicatrix@worldmail.nl</a> 
    or <a href="mailto:vdat@crosswinds.net">vdat@crosswinds.net</a>. For details 
    on future VDAT releases check my <a href="http://vdat.cjb.net">http://vdat.cjb.net</a> 
    URL redirection.</p>
  <p align="left">I know this might sound contrary to what people are used from 
    me, I used to support the &quot;unlimited and free information&quot; view 
    with most parts of my computer virus collection. But look at it from another 
    perspective, I could have stopped making VDAT all together, at least I'm leaving 
    an &quot;in&quot; to those that want it.</p>
  <p align="left">Reactions to this &quot;limited access&quot; to VDAT have been 
    mixed. I have had positive, negative, supportive, pleading and disappointed 
    reactions and I must say I understood most of them. Some of them asked me 
    to reconsider my decision and I did, but for now I have come to the same conclusion. 
    That is not to say that my view on all this will never change, only the future 
    will tell.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+2">The List</font></b></p>
</div>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Any version of an engine / tool / kit / zine (virus related) not mentioned 
      / included in VDAT is wanted. Since referencing VDAT will not be possible 
      without a key file contact me with details about the material you have to 
      offer. </li>
    <li>Be aware that outside the material I have included in VDAT I have a lot 
      of wannabe &quot;junk&quot; laying around that I have rejected as valid 
      entries. Copies of this &quot;junk&quot; will also be rejected in the future.</li>
    <li><b><i><font color="#FF8040">Please pay attention to specific version numbers 
      where specified</font></i></b>, some versions are very common, some are 
      rare. Many of you have sent me the better known versions thinking they were 
      supplying something from the list.</li>
  </ul>
