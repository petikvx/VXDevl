<P> <b>Objectives on this article</b></P>
<P>
  Watching most virus writers' code, I've noticed a lack of imagination
 when using ASM instructions:  there is a cool bunch of new of them
 since 486 and since PPro implementations, even not keeping in mind that the
 new MMX is here. You should use at least the new 486 instructions. Who
 is going to have win32 with a 386 ? CE ? &lt;g&gt;. 486+ instructions work in all
 AMD processors, and even the Pentium ones also do ( not the Pentium Pro and
 above ones... but they will ).
</P><P>
  So, I'm trying to describe some of them, as they can be very useful
 to you for code optimization, in polymorphism ( I'm telling :) ) and why
 not, to fool AVs.
</P><P>
  Thanks to Intel for not beeing the Microsoft way hiding what these
 stuff does ( though I had to make research and testing to get this working )
 providing me info to make this article, and to all the people I tested
 CPUID on.
</P>
<P> <b>Format used</b></P>
<PRE>
    - rX  : "register, X bytes", be X 8, 16 or 32.
    - rmX : "register or memory, X bytes", be X 8, 16 or 32.
    - immX: "immediate, X bytes", be X 8, 16 or 32

  INSTRUCTIONS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Bxx
   ~~~
    Format: Bxx rm16,r16
            Bxx rm32,r32
            Bxx rm16,imm8
            Bxx rm32,imm32

    Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
    Description: These are single bit operations, which can be really
   useful when writing a polymorphic engine: for example, if you have a
   table which stores anything in 10 bit chunks, this is the mode to
   access it.
</P><PRE>
        There are these ones:

        * BSWAP: Bit Swap
        * BT: Bit Test
        * BTR: Bit Test and Reset
        * BTS: Bit Test and Set
</PRE>
<P> These are some examples:</P>
<pre>           - BTS [esi],15h </pre>

<P>
          The processor goes to ESI address, adds it 15h bits and tests
         that specific bit. If it's a 1, it sets the Carry Flag, otherwise
         it clears it. Then, as it's "Bit Test and SET", sets that bit to
         1 ( Bit Test just tests it and keeps result in CF, and BTR does
         the same but making the specified bit be 0 instead of 1 ).
</P>
<pre>           - BSWAP [edi],ebx </pre>
<P>
          Processor goes to EDI address, adds EBX to it and swaps that bit:
         if it was 0 it's now 1, otherwise it's now a 0.
</P><P>
          So, you can see the first value ( that can of course be a register
         plus an offset ) is where we begin, then oount X bits from there.
         Forget all the 8/16/32 limitations :P
</P><P>
         Don't you begin realizing how useful is this ?
</P>
<P> <b>CMOVcc</b></P>
<PRE>
    Format: As mov, but cc has to be substituted by a condition, same asconditional jumps

    Processors: Pentium Pro +
</pre><P>
    Description: Fuck, conditional movs ! Have you ever thought about
   the possibilities we have with that stuff ? One thing to keep in mind,
   check the CPUID instruction before to know if the processor admits
   them. Right now I think I won't recommend it's use as they would only
   work in Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors, but as soon as people
   start to get them as a standard and AMD adds them to it's processors,
   you should change your mind.
</P>
<P> <b>CMPXCHG</b></P>
<PRE>
    Format: CMPXCHG rm8,r8
            CMPXCHG rm16,r16
            CMPXCHG rm32,r32

    Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
    Description: Looking at the name there's no further explanation to be
   added. Compares them and exchanges them.
</P>
<P> <b>CPUID</b> </P>
<PRE>
    Format: CPUID

    Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
    Description: Forget all that flag checking and stuff to know which
   processor do you have. CPUID ( CPU IDentification ) gives you info in
   registers EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX, depending on the value in EAX. If
   Intel tells us the truth, this is:
</P><PRE>
      EAX = 0
      -------
</PRE><P>
      EAX: Maximum CPUID value for EAX ( it's 2 now in PPro, while normal
   value is 1 )
</P><P>
        Intel gives us this:
</P><PRE>
      EBX = 'Genu'
      ECX = 'ineI'
      EDX = 'ntel'
</PRE><P>
        AMD comes with this, making the order EBX-EDX-ECX:
</P><PRE>
      EBX = 'Auth'
      EDX = 'enti'
      ECX = 'cAMD'
</PRE><P>
        Genuine wouldn't fit :)
</P><PRE>
      EAX = 1
      -------
</PRE><P>
      This is the important stuff. EAX holds version, while EDX holds
     information.
</P><PRE>
      EAX = Version Information:

        31-14: Useless
        13-12: Processor Type
        11-8: Processor Family
        7-4: Processor Model
        3-0: Stepping ID
</PRE><P>

          Let's watch how does this work. Of course, thanks to all the
         people who helped me to test this :). This are some value to that
         EAX information.
</P><PRE>
                      type  family    Model         Stepping ID
       PPro:    000   00    110       0001          ?
       K6-2:    000   00    101       1000          0000
       P133:    000   00    101       0010          1100
       P75:     000   00    101       0010          0100
</PRE><P>
            This is some info I researched by means of various people
         and complemented by some Intel little extracts I could get. It's
         not complete, but DX2 486 for example doesn't use CPUID instruction,
         and the other models are just OverDrive enhanced versions of these
         ones.

</PRE><P>
       Type: There are four kinds: 00 means a normal processor, as
      01 is an OverDrive Processor, 10 is a dual processor, and 11 is
      still reserved.
</P><P>
       Family: Indicates if it's a 486, 586 or 686; for a Pentium,
      it will be 101, for a 486 it will be 100, Pentium Pro and II gets
      110. K6 models have the same as Pentium ( 101 )
</P><P>
       Model: Models in the same family. You can check out the results,
      as for example P75 and P133 are the same Model for example.
</P><P>
       Stepping ID: Revisions in the same model.
</P><PRE>
        EDX = Feature Information:
</PRE><P>
        I'm showing just the most interesting.
</P><PRE>
        bit    feature

        00     If there is an FPU ( co-processor )
        04     If RDTSC instruction works
        15     If CMOVcc instructions work.
</PRE><P>
        Anyway, there are lots of fields ( most of em useless for us ),
       specially awaiting to be filled as new instructions arise.
</P>
<P> <b>ICEBP</b></P>
<PRE>
        Format: db 0f1h
</PRE><P>
        Description: This undocumented opcode works on every Intel processor,
       but not in AMD or Cyrix ones. It just generates an int1h instruction.
       Cool as Vecna said for polymorphic engines, as it fooled even Softice
       non recognizing it as a valid opcode.
</P>
<P> <b>Jcc</b></P>
<PRE>
        Format: As usual conditional jumps

        Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
        Description: You just forget all that shit about only using short
       relative jumps. You can easily jump to rel16 or rel32 offsets, so
       it seems the big bad stuff about relative jumping is completely
       eliminated. Code optimization and very big decryptors in your
       polymorphic code.

</P>
<P> <b>MOVZX,MOVSX</b></P>
<PRE>
        Format: MOV?X r16,r/m8
                MOV?X r32,r/m8
                MOV?X r32,r/m16

        Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
        Description: MOVe with Zero eXtend or MOVe with Sign eXtend. This
       instruction lets you move a r/m to a register from a bigger size,
       zero extending the high part or sign extending it. This means you
       won't need to do a xor cx,cx/mov cl,bl if you for example got a
       random number in bl to make a loop, and some other applications you
       would think.
</P>
<P> <b>RDTSC</b></P>
<PRE>
    Format: RDTSC

    Processors: Pentium or +. AMD K6 also supports it.
</PRE><P>
    Description: Forget all the ways on getting a random value: this
   instruction gets the processor's time-stamp counter into EDX:EAX,
   a 64 bit long random number ( it increments in each clock cycle ).
   It's problem is that if the TSD flag ( time stamp disable, in register
   CR4 ) is set, you only can exec this from ring 0.
</P><P>
    I recommend anyway just getting the value in eax if you want values
   that fill completely the register, as edx lasts a lot to be filled ( well,
   maybe for slow poly it could be great ). Of course, you can modify the CR4
   register as the other Control Registers, but you must be ring0 again to
   perform that :)
</P><P>
    Who would want to hide us the Stamp Counter ???

</P>
<P> <b>XADD</b></P>
<PRE>
    Format: XADD rm8,r8
            XADD rm16,r16
            XADD rm32,r32

    Processors: 486+
</PRE><P>
    Description: It exchanges the source and destiny operands, loading the
   sum into the rmX ( the destiny ). Cool for optimizing code or just making
   it "another way".

</P>
<P> <b>VERR/VERW</b></P>
<PRE>
    Format: VERX rm16

    Processors: Pentium Pro+
</PRE><P>
    Description: Checks if a segment is readable or writable ( with VERR
   or VERW ) from the current prilege level. This segment can be code or data,
   and the operand is an address ( register or immediate ) that contains
   the segment selector for the one you want to check. If you can read or
   write it ( depending on if it's VERR or VERW ), the ZF will be = 1,
   otherwise it will be = 0. The cool thing on this is that this won't
   generate any exception, of course :), so you could stop having to use
   the SEH for searching the kernel32.dll base address.
</P><P>
    Bad news are that it's not supported by AMD processors and Pentium ones;
   just a bet for the future.
</P>
