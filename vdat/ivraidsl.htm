<P>RaiD is one of the more outspoken virus writers of the 'scene' openly
creating confrontation with the AV community at large as well as many of
his 'guinea pigs'. He is the author of such virii as: the Weed family (v1.0-1.5),
the Rustybug Family (v1.0-1.1), and in more recent times the Krile family
(v1.0-1.0g and counting) all written in ASIC. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Tell us a little about yourself; what do you
do? age? where are you from? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well...I'm a computer technician by trade.. eheh... And I've fiddled
with other electronics...cb, ham radio...hehe... I'm 20 now....I'm from....well....all
over the usa I guess you could say...I've been almost everywheres ... heh
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What was your first experience with a computer
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hrm...Well, for some odd reason, I've never actually been infected by
one...Er, except a few of mine...But, heh, we all have little accidents
&lt;EG&gt; So..My first real experience with one would be when I wanted
to know more about them...so I got ahold of Chiba City BBS (anyone remember
those?) number...called long distance alot. ehehe. I downloaded...erm,
Oh yea...Green catapiller I guess....I infected an old computer I had..and
just watched it...it was...neat.. ehehehe </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How long have you been involved in virus writing
and in SLAM? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well...I wrote weed v1.0 in .....96-97.... Sometime around there..It
got wild in the first part of 97...so musta been 96... I joined <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A>
in 97...Ive almost been in it for one year..the group that is.... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Tell us a little about SLAM and its members,
the group is not nearly as outspoken as yourself, what are SLAMs plans
for the future? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well...to be honest, SLAM is a very relaxed group. Were not interested
in competing. But, I'll tell you this....SLAM will be showing you all kinds
of new things in <A HREF="ezines1.htm#SLAM">SLAM #4</A>, and yea, I know..delays,
but it'll be worth the wait. &lt;EG&gt; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Please give a brief description of the ASIC
language to those unfamiliar with it. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Also....Well, for starters to kill a stupid rumer...ASIC is *not* basic,
nor a basic subset or dialec. While it shares some familiarities, it is
by no means basic. It's a rather...intricate language, once you get used
to it. At first it appears as utter junk, but once you get under the hood...You
learn to appreciate it's power.... Much like...c-- (not ++) and asm. :-)
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did you choose to write your virii in ASIC
out of want or necessity (ie:do you know other languages well enough to
write virii in them also)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, I wanted to see if I could do it. I'd read and watched viruses...I
wanted to write one, in a language which would make it a bitch to remove.
(I have my reasons). I learned how to use some dos interrupts, and file
io control thanks to it. -) eheh...But, my later viruses are being more...asm
built then anything else now adays. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">We have spoken before about your conversations
with the creator of ASIC, what did he have to say about the fact that you
wrote your virii exclusivly in his language? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well....Lets put it this way....He wasn't impressed. :-) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion on the spreading of virii?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hrm.....I could lie.....Nah...I'll stick with no comment. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What methods do you use for the spreading of
your virii? Are there any particular groups or types of people you focus
on infecting? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ehehe...well, I've found..warez is the best way to spread them.... Of
course theres others, but....lets not get into that....:-) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What would do you have to say to innocent parties
who have been infected by your virii? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hrm..well...uhh, Sucks to be that person...Hope they learned...ehehehe
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You play devils advocate with many members
of the Anti-virus community (particularly on alt.comp.virus) what are your
motives behind this? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There are none. AV in general do not deserve the unrealistic credit
they get...Especially shit ones like Symantec and Mcafee er...Network Associates...
And I try to have....pleasant discussion, but....Thats just not possible...Besides,
if we didnt exist, they wouldnt either. Supply and Demand and all. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think of the AV community in general?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In general, I consider them pompous assholes. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What members/products do you respect in the
AV community? which do you dislike? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In this order I like: AVP,DSAV,FPROT I despise anything not mentioned...:-)
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are there any groups/writers that you have
particular respect for (outside of SLAM)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sure...<A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29a</A>, <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
(now defunct as I recall)...and oh yea...<A HREF="groups1.htm#FS">FS</A>...ehehe.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why do you work and rework one particular virus
rather then moving to new and different virii as most virus writers do?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hrm...Well, I like the name KRiLE.. just stuck with me so far...:-)
Besides, I know these later generations of my creations piss AV off, and
probably embarras em...AV: just wait till I get tsr down. &lt;EG&gt; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What kind of virii do you plan to write in
the future? Do you plan on sticking with ASIC or moving into other programming
language? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well...I'll use a combination of asic and asm...sometimes pure asm viruses
sometimes asic ones....No sense getting rid of something which works...:-)
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think of microsoft? Many virus
writers despise microsoft but without them virus writing would not be what
it is today, what do you think of this love/hate relationship? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like microsoft. Because of them, and there winshit95+, complete
fucking morons can get on a computer.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think the future of virus writing
is? Are we at the tip of the iceberg or nearing end of the road? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>As long as an OS is popular, and is used, and theres an interest, they'll
be a virus for it. I consider virus coding a challenge. :-) </P>
</UL>
