<P>Yes: Scanners sometimes false alarm...</P>

<P>No: Then you must have some other reason for thinking that you have
a virus. The symptoms of a virus are sometimes similar to other symptoms,
so we will have some work to do here.</P>

<P>I did not scan: Scanning would be a good idea. It is probably the single
best way of determining whether you have a virus.</P>

No Virus</FONT></B></P>

<P>If you scanned with a good, recently updated scanner, and found no virus,
you <I>may</I> not have one. Scanners detect a large percentage of those
viruses you are most likely to get.</P>

<P>However, scanners do not detect all viruses. We recently tested one
&quot;good&quot; scanner against our collection of 55,000 virus samples,
and found 5,500 that it did not detect. One of those viruses might be in
your machine. You will have to use other clues to determine if you have
a virus, or get another scanner.</P>

<P>When a file is copied from one drive location to another, it passes
through memory. The copy command leaves a useless copy of the file in memory,
to be overwritten by the next process that requires this memory. If you
copy a file that is infected from one place to another, then scan memory,
your scanner may find the virus in memory.</P>

<P>This is not a false alarm, but it is certainly a misdiagnosis. The copy
of the file that is in memory cannot be accessed, must less executed. Your
machine is NOT infected by merely copying an infected file.</P>

two different scanners since booting this computer</FONT></B></P>

<P>If you run scanner 1, then scan memory with scanner 2, scanner 2 will
sometimes find a scan string in memory left behind by scanner 1, and report
the virus name that matches that scan string. This is a false alarm.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>How it Works</FONT></B></P>

<OL>
<LI>When a scanner runs, it reads its scan strings from a file, and places
them in memory. One or more of its strings were likely taken from a published
source (such as Virus Bulletin), and so is widely used by other vendors
who also use strings from such sources. (Nearly every vendor will use reliable
strings when they cannot obtain a specimen of the virus, because they want
their products to detect the virus!)</LI>

<LI>Scanner 1 exits, not clearing memory. Its strings remain until overwritten
by the next program.</LI>

<LI>Scanner 2 now runs, and tries matching its stored strings with what
it can see in memory. It finds a match, and as implausible as this is,
yells for help.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Should scanners false alarm this way?</FONT></B></P>

<P>No.</P>

<P>The problem would be prevented if scanner 1 cleared memory when it exited,
removing its scan strings from memory. The problem would be prevented if
scanner 2 used a little good judgment, and recognized the folly of looking
for a scan string in the location in which the match was found. (Viruses
are found at the bottom of conventional memory (they &quot;load low&quot;)
or at the top (they &quot;load high&quot;), and never smack in the middle,
where the scan strings will normally be located. The virus in question
almost certainly could not be located in memory where it is reported. For
instance, a virus that loads low will never be found in the middle or top
of conventional memory; a virus that loads high (just below 640K) will
never be found low.</P>

<P>Good scanners do not leave strings in memory, so can always be run before
a second scanner. They look for virus scan strings in memory in a position-sensitive
way, so are unlikely to determine that a previously-run scanner is a virus.
Seven Locks Software's MEMSCAN doesn't even use scanstrings, but rather
uses the same &quot;are you there&quot; calls that the virus uses, so it
is will not false alarm on some other product's scan strings.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Testing this Hypothesis</FONT></B></P>

<P>Deciding if you have a false alarm from this condition is simple: record
the name of the virus found, boot clean (from uninfected floppy), and run
the second scanner again, against the entire drive. If you have a real
virus, you will find the same virus on the drive that you recently found
in memory. If no such virus is found on the drive, you have found a false
alarm, instead.</P>

<P>You can try a second test of the hypothesis that this is a false alarm:
Reboot from your hard disk, and scan memory with scanner 2 <I>before</I>
running scanner 1. It should find nothing if you have a false alarm on
scanner 1's scan string residue. Now run scanner 1, followed by scanner
2. Scanner 2 should now false alarm on that same virus in memory.</P>

<P><A NAME="Moreinfo"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>More info: You found a stealth
virus (such as Monkey) in Memory</FONT></B></P>

<P>A stealth boot virus is like any other boot virus, except for one interesting
characteristic: when you (or some software) asks the computer to examine
a sector in which the virus is located, the virus &quot;redirects&quot;
the software to instead view the <I>original</I> (uninfected) sector. Your
anti-virus software believes it is examining the master boot sector, but
it is actually examining the displaced master boot record. It doesn't find
any problem, and moves on in its search for the virus. </P>

<P>A stealth boot virus can be easily seen by anti-virus software if the
virus is not active in memory (if you have booted clean), or if you can
disable the copy of the virus that is in memory. But such software usually
has trouble finding a stealth boot virus in your boot area if the virus
is active in memory. So a report of a virus in memory, with no other copy
on your drive, can be because the virus is stealth.</P>

<P>To find a non-stealth file virus in memory, use the command MEM /C /P.
Any program that &quot;allocates&quot; memory will be listed. If, since
booting, you have run an infected non-resident program, you might see a
that program listed when you run MEM /C /P. You know that 1-2-3 does not
use 2 Kb of memory, and that it is not a TSR. So if you see it listed here,
it might be infected! Look at other machines which you believe to be virus-free,
to see if they differ in this result.</P>

<P>A file virus will infect many files, but only the first infected file
to run will put the virus in memory. So even if 1-2-3 is infected, and
even if you have run it since booting, the virus might not go resident
via 1-2-3 if it has already gone resident when some other infected program
ran.</P>

<P>Not all resident viruses will show up with the MEM command. Some will
not allocate memory, instead loading up at the top of memory, where they
think they are safe. A program that allocates memory will not be overwritten
as other programs load; a program that loads at the top of memory will
rarely be overwritten. Viruses which load at the top of memory are generally
craftier than those which allocate memory, and may show other &quot;stealth&quot;
properties as well.</P>

<P>Run CHKDSK (no switches). It should report &quot;655,360 total bytes
memory&quot;. If you have a number less than this, it is because some program
loaded before DOS and reduced the memory available to DOS. That program

<P>Record the number of total bytes of memory DOS thinks it has. Divide
the number by 1,024 (1 Kb) to determine how many Kb you are missing. Use

<P>This might be a virus, or might be a &quot;joke&quot; program.</P>

<UL>
<LI>It is likely a joke program if your scanner identified the &quot;virus&quot;
using the word &quot;joke&quot; Because joke programs sometimes are confused
with viruses by users, many products detect this category of software,
too. But jokes are not viruses. They don't make copies of themselves, and
don't add their code to other programs.</LI>

<LI>It is likely a joke program if the screen display is extremely obvious,
or triggers reliably soon after you turn your machine on. Jokes are intended
to get your attention. Viruses try to not get your attention, so they can
spread. While some viruses do display messages on the screen, the more
obvious a virus is, the more poorly it spreads, and the lower your chances
of getting it. Count on viruses being subtle, jokes being obvious.</LI>
</UL>

<P>&quot;Joke&quot; programs can cause letters to drip from the screen,
a flasher to popup in the middle of your word processing activity, or water
to be detected in drive A:. Joke programs are not usually received with
the same mirth and goodwill as was involved in their creation and installation.
They are not viruses, but users frequently believe they are. </P>

<UL>
<LI>How do joke programs differ from viruses? How can they be distinguished?
There are several ways. Viruses rarely display anything on the screen;
jokes would have little point if they didn't display something vaguely
humorous. About 60% of all viruses are memory resident, and most of the
viruses your organization will ever get are resident. In contrast, most
joke programs are simple non-resident programs called from a batch file.
But most important, viruses make copies of themselves, and jokes don't.
</LI>

<LI>Detecting a joke can be done by looking for an unfamiliar line in AUTOEXEC.BAT
or your logon script, or looking for an unfamiliar program on the machine.
The DOS MEM program is likely to be able to show you the joke in memory,
if it is resident. Many scanners detect joke programs, though no scanner
will detect all jokes. You won't be able to &quot;remove&quot; the joke,
except by deleting the file. </LI>

that the sky is falling or that it is foggy. But you should know that your
odds are low for getting a virus, and much lower for getting a new, rare
virus. </LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>If your scanner is false alarming, call the vendor and ask if they
are aware of the problem. If so, ask for a copy of the &quot;fix&quot;
to be sent. You should not have to pay for this, or wait more than a week
or so.</LI>

<LI>If your scanner is false alarming, and the vendor is unaware of the
problem, send them a sample of the program that is not getting along with
the scanner. You have the right to expect a free solution in two weeks
or less.</LI>

<P>If your scanner finds it in a file or boot sector today that it didn't
find it in yesterday, then you have a virus. Any false alarm should be
a repeatable event, if the same switches are used and the same files or
sectors are examined. So if your scanner has never alarmed when scanning,
and now does when looking at previously scanned stuff, you've got a virus.

<P>If your scanner reports a virus in &quot;ABC.COM&quot; on one machine,
but not in &quot;ABC.COM&quot; on other machines, then it may be telling
the truth. If the scanner is false alarming, then it is finding a match
between one of its scan strings and the code in some part of the file.
The scanner should give the same false alarm on every copy of this file
that is the same version. But if two copies of ABC.COM version 1.234 are
examined, and only one contains the virus, your scanner is likely on to
something. Check the size of the two files after a clean boot: the infected
one will either be larger (a &quot;parasitic&quot; virus) or it won't run
properly (an overwriting virus). </P>

is the opinion of a second scanner you trust?</FONT></B></P>

<P>If two scanners agree that some file is infected with something, it
likely is. Scanners are sometimes wrong. Many scanners miss more viruses
than they detect. Most can't catch all copies of any of the world's 250+
polymorphics. None seem to agree on what a virus should be named. So if
you can find two of these uncooperative weapons that agree that file &quot;X&quot;
is infected, believe it.</P>

<P>Of course, two scanners can be wrong. Even when they agree on a name.
One explanation is the Virus Bulletin virus: Virus Bulletin publishes a
scan string for virus XYZ. Neither vendor has a copy of this virus, so
they both use the Virus Bulletin scan string, and name anything that matches
&quot;XYZ.&quot; Both products find their way to your machine, where they
both detect the scan string in some odd place, and pronounce that file
infected. Both, in such a case, might be wrong. Two wrongs don't make a
right.</P>

the &quot;infected&quot; program larger in this machine than in other machines?</FONT></B></P>

<P>If the suspect file on this machine is larger than on other machines,
and you are not running any anti-virus software that adds protection to
files, then it is quite possibly infected. Viruses add code to programs,
and code takes bytes. Our smallest virus is about 30 bytes, our largest
around 15 Kb. But the average virus adds 1,140 bytes or so to a file -
about 1 Kb. You will need to get out your notepad to record such subtle
differences between infected and uninfected, but unless the virus &quot;stealths&quot;
its size, you'll be able to see which are infected by comparing the sizes
of infected and uninfected files. Even a stealth virus can be caught this
way if it is not resident, which you can force by booting clean. </P>

or use some generic name, such as &quot;GenB&quot; or &quot;Jerusalem Family&quot;?</FONT></B></P>

<P>The less precise your scanner in naming, the more it proves to be guessing,
based on partial information. For instance, suppose a scanner is looking
for two scan strings in order to identify a virus: string A and string
B. Suppose it finds A only. The scanner is likely to report &quot;[name
of family defined by scan string A] family&quot; or &quot;[name of family
defined by scan string A] related&quot; or &quot;new variant of [name of
family defined by scan string A]&quot; But considering the length of scan
string A, this presumption is a bit risky. Your odds of a false alarm are
higher when your scanner doesn't do a positive, exact identification.</P>

<P>Scanners sometimes false alarm on polymorphic viruses or new, rare viruses.
But they rarely false alarm on common viruses. Scanners which follow the
jumps within a file produce few false alarms because they use position
information for its scan strings, not just scan strings. The chance of
the string &quot;ABCDEFGHIJ&quot; being in a file is non-zero. But the
chance of finding it in a pre-defined location - at the end of a series
of jumps - is essentially zero. On the other hand, a scanner using a &quot;heuristics&quot;
or &quot;analyze&quot; switch is quite likely to false alarm. Many programs
contain code that is virus-like.</P>

<P>It is likely a false alarm if your late-model, trustworthy scanner identifies
it only as a &quot;possible&quot; virus, and only in one file. If the scanner
you trust doesn't have the nerve to assert that it has found a virus, but
rather wimpers that there might be something here, the chance is there
is nothing here. </P>

<P>If the scanner refers to this single file as containing a &quot;damaged&quot;
virus, it means that the scanner has found part of one of its short scan
strings. Part of a 10-byte scan string is not enough for you to base career
decisions on. Get a second opinion, from another scanner you trust even
more or from a virus expert. And consider the other factors suggested here
in reaching your conclusion.</P>

<P><A NAME="Doestheinfectedfilereportitselftobeinfected"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Does
the &quot;infected&quot; file report itself to be infected?</FONT></B></P>

<P>This might be a false alarm caused by one scanner adding checksum or
inoculation information to a file, and that file, when run, detecting this
unwanted modification. Many anti-virus products write some code to files
to &quot;inoculate&quot; the file. Inoculation is the process of scanning
the file for viruses using scan strings, then adding to the file its checksum,
or a checksum for the top and perhaps bottom bytes of the file. On the
second pass, the scanner becomes a checksummer, comparing the current checksum
with that stored in the file. This process can be very fast, and so products
such as Central Point AntiVirus, IBM's Anti-Virus Software Product, and
Norton AntiVirus turn out to be checksummers in normal use, scanning only
those files that haven't been checksummed. </P>

<UL>
<LI>When a file is inoculated, the file changes and grows in size. If the
file happens to be a program that does a checksum of itself before loading,
it will find that it has changed, and usually exit with a warning that
it has been modified. If the program does not check itself, then an inoculation
false alarm can occur if two anti-virus products try to inoculate the same
file. The second to inoculate it will never find a problem, since its checksum
is based on a combination of the original file and the code added by the
first inoculator, but the first inoculator always should find a problem,
since the program has changed and grown since first inoculation. In some
cases, the first inoculator will be able to remove the effects of the second
inoculator. </LI>

<LI>If you have any product capable of inoculation, and then upgrade to
another product, it is important to remove any old inoculations before
discarding the old product, as we have nothing in our package to remove
the inoculations of other anti-virus software. (If it is too late, and
you have already discarded all copies of the other product, contact that
product's vendor for help.)</LI>

Infected File Named COMMAND.COM?</FONT></B></P>

<P>Vendors may not test their scanners on every program in the world, but
they surely have had a chance to test it against COMMAND.COM. Since over
1,900 viruses infect COMMAND.COM, an alarm here is likely meaningful.</P>

<P>But why only COMMAND.COM? Perhaps you just got infected (many viruses
will infect COMMAND.COM first, and not infect other files until you reboot.)
Perhaps this is a &quot;multi-partite&quot; virus which infects the boot
area and COMMAND.COM only. Perhaps other files are infected, too, but the
virus in memory protects them from being seen as infected by your scanner.
Frankly, having only COMMAND.COM infected is an odd condition!</P>

<P>It is a false alarm if your scanner finds the virus in a swap file,
TXT file, .DAT file, .DBF file, or some other data file only. A virus can
add its code to anything it can reach, which means that your jelly donut
is safe, your data files and documents and spreadsheets are not. But since
your operating system has no idea on how to <U>run</U> (load and execute
instructions in) data files, it won't be able to run a virus that is in
them. If there is virus code in your Notepad document, then you will be
able to see it when you open the file with Notepad. </P>

<P>You have no chance of finding a virus in a data file unless you tell
the product to scan &quot;all files&quot;. In such a case, a scanner that
follows jumps in files may still not false alarm, because the data file
just doesn't have such an organization. However, there are many scanners
on the market that just grab a big gob of a file and with brute force look
for the set of scan strings in the gob. The results can be silly, embarrassing,
or terrifying, but they are most often wrong. One California vendor lost
a fortune on a case involving such a false alarm. </P>

<P>If you use it all the time, the &quot;virus&quot; has had lots of time
to make more copies of itself. If it has failed to do this, it has failed
to meet the definition of a virus - code which makes functionally identical
copies of itself without user permission. If it isn't a virus, we don't
need to worry. </P>

than One File</FONT></B></P>

<P>If your scanner found a virus of the same name in more than one file,
you almost certainly DO HAVE a virus. </P>

<P>Viruses are rarely loners. They like company in the machine, and make
their own friends. If you find just one file infected with some exotic
polymorphic, and you run this file repeatedly, you either have a false
alarm or a virus that doesn't want to come out and play - most likely a
false alarm. On the other hand, if 10 files are found to contain the XYZ
virus, then at least 10 files are infected with this virus. </P>

<P>False alarms are sufficiently rare that you are unlikely to have more
than one false alarm per scan. Finding a virus in two or more files likely
means that the virus spread from one of these file to the other(s). If
you have only a few infected files, and you can determine which of these
files you most recently acquired, it may be that this file is the source
of the virus.</P>

<P>If you can establish where the virus came from, you will want to contact
the source and tell them what you've learned. They may be unaware of the
infection.</P>

<P>By looking at how many files are infected, and which of these was least
recently run, you may be able to guess about how long you have been infected.
Any user you have shared any of these files with is likely to be infected.</P>
