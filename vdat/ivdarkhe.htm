<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Give me a short description of who you are!
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well I'm male, 24 years old and I'm last year student computer science.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">From where did you get your handle, Dark Helmet?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I got the name from a film of Mel Brooks called 'Spaceballs'. The film
itself is a parody on the Sciene Fiction films. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you discovered the world of computers?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think I was about 10 years old when I got my first game computer (a
Philips ..., I forgot the name). Later when I was about 14, I bought a
C64 (great computer) then 4 years later I bought an Atari 520 ST computer.
And a couple years later a PC, which I still use today. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How long have you been active in the scene?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think about a 2 years, about 6 months after I bought my PC. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you came into the virus business? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I got involved with viruses at my school. At that time people didn't
know much about viruses and when the school got hit by a virus I wanted
to know more about these things. So I started to collect viruses. Thats
how I got in contact with [Sorry censored!] who just had started with [More
censor!] a Hack/Phreak/Virus BBS. After just collecting I tried to write
my own virus. So I wrote my first virus a overwriting non-resident virus
of 44 bytes. It took me about 3 hours to write it because I hadn't programmed
in assembler before. Most of knowledge I got from books that you can buy
at you local bookshop. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you been involved in any other group than
Trident? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nope.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who started/created Trident? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it was Tardy who started the group. He also came up with the
name TridenT. There where four members when the group started. John Tardy,
Peter Venkman, Bit Addict and Dark Helmet (me). The group was founded in
the summer of '92. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What's the groups goal? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To write viruses and to exchange idea's </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many people are you? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who are the &quot;leading/head-persons&quot;

does the things he likes. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is Trident (currently) organzied? </FONT></B></P>

network between the members. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you got any contacts with other virus-groups/programmers?

<UL>
<P>There are some contacts with the other main viruswriting groups in the
virusworld. And there is also some sort of contact with other virusprogrammers
in the Netherlands. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Can anyone ask for membership, or are you a

</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever thought of/are you currently
releasing some sort of electronic magazine (text/executable/hard-copy)
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yea, well we have discussed this idea a long time, but because of the
new laws in the netherland we didn't do it.... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you into other things such as hacking and
phreaking aswell, or just viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well a the beginning I did a little bit of hacking aswell but I stopped
with that because the phone bills got to high </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have some network-connection? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yea, the CRI, I think Tardy can you tell more about this. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">If so, are they a real threat or just &quot;childish&quot;?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>

</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have any couriers that spread your products
around? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I upload the creation to a Vx board and then it will spread itself
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the laws against h/p/v
that has arrived lately? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I here they are becoming a problem to us, because you have to be very
carefull that you don't break the law </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you feel guilty if one of your viruses
made damage to a hospital? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't thinks so, because I don't feel responsible if someone else
start releasing viruses in the wild. As a matter of fact I think that the
most viruswriters don't spread there creation around in the wild. I think
that the whole virus problem is exaggerated by some anti-virus people.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you see any differences between the scene
now and a couple of years ago (concerning the underground part ofcause)?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well its much more organized then a few years back, and there is also
more contact with the other groups and viruswriters. and there are now
much more people involved then a few years back. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which virus-magazine do you think is the best
avalible now-a-days? </FONT></B></P>

<P><A HREF="ezines1.htm#CRYPT">Crypt</A> and <A HREF="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40Hex</A>,

</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which virus-group/programmer do you admire/like?

<P>No one..,I don't believe in that hero stuff andso.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which country is the best virus-writing today?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Maybe Russia, don't know exactly... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which virus-group(s) do you think is the best?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think <A HREF="groups2.htm#PS">Phalcon/Skism</A> is very good. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about these virus generators,
such as <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</A> or <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#PSMPC">PS-MPC</A>?
<A HREF="creatrs1.htm#IVP">IVP</A>, <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#GV">NUKE-GV</A>
etc. etc.? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm working on my own <A HREF="creators.htm">virus generator</A> now,
that will generating viruses the polymorphic way. It was planned to be
ready last xmas, but some things came up and I don't know when I finnish
it yet. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the people using them?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well I don't see the fun of using a virusconstructor and generate a
virus and spread it. I mean whats the point of it. Be orginal and try to
write your own virus. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about people bragging over
(almost) nothing and ragging with other groups aswell? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ignore them... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about such individes as board-crashers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Depends on the reason for crashing the board. But if there is no good
reason I see it as pure vandalism. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus : </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think there is suchs thing as a perfect virus, every virus has
some negative aspects.... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV-program do think is the best, and
why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>F-Prot, it has a easy to use user-interface, and it has a good detection
rate of viruses. For students its free. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the underground's future?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think there is no more real underground, I think is will more public
in the future. Next I believe that the underground will become more organzied
both in contact between each other as in more groups. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any advice to people who want's to learn the
basic of virus-writing? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>1. Buy a good book. (I learned a lot of 'Advanced MS-DOS programming,
by Ray Duncan, second edition, Microsoft Press, Redmond WA, USA)<BR>
2. Then get some real viruses and study them.<BR>
3. Try to write a simple virus, like a overwriting one, or a simple non-resident
infector, then move up to resident ones and so on. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Something else you wish to say? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sorry that I don't have more time to fill out all the question, and
that I didn't have time to remove all the spelling and grammar error. If
you have anything to ask, you can reach me xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you wish to send any greets? </FONT></B></P>
