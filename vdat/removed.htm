<P>In an attempt to keep the size of this database within certain (web
friendly) limits I have started weeding out certain parts. These parts
mainly contained duplicated or outdated information and the added value
to the database was limited. I realize I might have deleted stuff that
still had a certain audience but I would refer those to older releases
of VDAT. To keep people aware of the information that was there at a certain
time I have greyed out the deleted references and I have added a reference
to the last VDAT where the info can be found.</P>
