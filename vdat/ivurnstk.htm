<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Give me a short description of who you are! </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Urnst Kouch, editor of Crypt Newsletter. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you picked that alias, Urnst Kouch?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No reason - it's just a name. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How long have you been scene-active? (both
normal and underground) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't closely distinguish the 'normal' and the 'underground', as others.
To me, it's all the same - all part of computing. People use different
jargon, wear different uniforms, have different interests but motivations
and behavior are pretty much the same. Maybe that sounds heretical to you,
but I assure you, it's how I look at it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you started your bbs? (why?) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started my system as a convenience - an easy way to talk to virus
programmers. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What to you think about the bbs-community (past
and now-a-days) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's very stale. But, unlike some, I don't think there ever was a golden
age of BBS'ing. There were extremely focused computer aficianados who broke
ground with like-minded users. They were all very into the idea of electronic
communities. But, all communities, whether made of brick and stone or wires
and chips have one common factor, humanity. My hometown is, by and large,
largely ignorant, gossipy dickheads. It's stale and always has been. BBS
communities are built along the same lines - clubby, like-minded individuals
who - by and large - enjoy trivial gossip which they're convinced is of
earth-shattering significance. If you look in from the outside, it's pretty
stale, too. Different media, same old song and dance. I must confess, I
don't think it will change much, unless you really buy into the concepts
of real-time pornographic chat lines or the hoarding of software as socially
invigorating developments. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you came into the virus scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Back in 1992 around the time of the great Michelangelo hype, it became
necessary as part of my job at a newspaper to learn something of computer
viruses. And it became readily apparent that I wasn't going to learn anything
of viruses by talking to 'experts' on the subject, although they were all
happy to sell me software, thank you. So I became determined to find viruses
and virus source code by myself, so that it could be determined what these
programs did at a very fundamental level. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What part of the underground do you think needs
improvements? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The underground could stand to be less adolescent and secretive. When
big corporations are secretive, everyone gets annoyed and cries foul, so
why is this a desirable trait in the underground? I mean, unless you're
really a psychopath and into 'breaking the law, breaking the law!', I don't
get it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which groups/mags have you been involved with?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Crypt Newsletter, that's it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Tell me the background history of Crypt Newsletter?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's two years old and has been steadily monthly since I started it
with another fellow, since departed, by the name of Pallbearer. For the
first year, it focused primarily on virus issues, but for the last year
it's quickly branched into just about anything to do with science, technology
and computers that catches my fancy. We have a funny media critic known
as Mr. Badger and the newsletter has been extremely effective at lining
the walls of my library with all manner of books on science and technology
which I get as review copies. And I do review them! Much of the virus material
in the newsletter is serving as the basis for a book on the virus underground
which I'll be finished with around September. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who is the persons behind Crypt? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Originally, it was myself and Pallbearer. Pallbearer dropped out after
a few issues. Then Mr. Badger wrote me a letter I liked so much I asked
to publish it. From there, I was able to persuade him to contribute regularly.
There's Stormbringer, whose contributed quite a bit of code, along with
Nikademus, who lives across the country from me. And let's not forget the
mighty Kohntark who serves as what I like to call our Entropic Systems
Editor. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">From where do you got all the support stuff
for Crypt? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Ummm, support stuff? I'm not sure I know what you mean by that. If you
mean where it's distributed, I don't have a master plan. I felt it was
good and that if so, others would pick up the ball without prompting and
make it convenient for other people to find, and that's pretty much what
has happened. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Can everyone include stuff in Crypt Newsletter?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, yes and no. Yes, in that the door's always open and I'll look
at anything at least once. No, in that the newsletter is rather idiosyncratic
in its style - and I like to keep it that way. It gives it a consistent
quality. It's tough for people to hit that style the way I like it, and
if that's the case I generally don't want to use their material. I suggest
try again next time or send it around to someone who may be a better fit
with what the contributor produces. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which other 'magazine' do you think is the
best one available? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's poor form - and ungentlemanly, besides - to comment on competitors
and colleagues. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which group are you considering as the best
virus-writing group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm inclined to favor TridenT, but that's because I like their idiosyncratic
thinking. Plus, they've always been generous of ideas with Crypt. This
is meant as no slight to anyone else. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why do you think it's important for groups
to release magazine's, news-letter, info-journals, etc? (Why does everybody
realese them?) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm for anything or anyone with a journalistic bent. If it's important
to you that a story - as you see it - be told, then it's important to do
some kind of magazine or publication. You can't depend on the mainstream
to do it, or even get it right, so there needs to be a balance between
the do-it-yourselfer's and the corporate giants. Plus, I think anyone can
see that the press as they've been taught to recognize it, is not particularly
fair or even free, which makes it essential that other points of view have
a venue to speak in, even if it's small. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you write own viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Then, which one have you written? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hah. I'll paraphrase 'The Prisoner.' That would be telling. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about destructive viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The term destructive viruses is a non-issue. Consider a moment what
the average computer user - one who can barely figure out Windows or DOS
- thinks of the term virus, pounded in to him by the media for the last
three years. Destructive virus is redundant. To him, all viruses, are destructive.
In fact, any program which would complicate turning on the PC or make it
behave more weirdly than it already does, would be classified destructive.
A virus that overwrites the hard file with trash isn't much of a distinction
from one that has no such code, to this user. So - it's purely an argument
for programmers, basically, . . . or brain dead computer journalists who
feel it's a topic worth writing about. Of course, we _know_ there are people
interested in viruses as tools for studying artificial life; those interested
in using virus-like action in house-keeping software robots and certain
individuals - in the military, as well as hobbyists - who write viruses
to specifically corrupt data. It's all part of a spectrum which is not
of much interest to the average user and, to me, the differences have no
particularly special social or moral value. It's just code, all part of
the stuff of which viruses are made. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There is no more a 'perfect' virus than there are any 'perfect' operating
systems. A 'perfect' virus would be 100 percent undetectable and completely
transparent on any system. And then how would you even know the virus was
there? You wouldn't. It's like the old argument, 'Does a tree falling in
the forest make a sound if there's no one there to hear it?' How can you
tell? Next question. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">There is lotsa Polymorphic engines out there,
but not too many seems too use them, do you have a theory of why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, polymorphic objects aren't truly plug-and-play. They're poorly
documented and certain features of many carry over from characteristics
of the <A HREF="engine1.htm#MTE">Mutation Engine</A>, which wasn't particularly
relocatable. So offspring of the MtE, so to speak, aren't relocatable,
which limits their ease of use. That being the case, most people will try
and design their own engines from the ground up without worrying about
if others will use it. Hence, they never really became 'user-friendly.'
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which engine do you considering as the best?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Who knows? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you know/heard of any new virus-writing
technics coming in the near future? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I suspect there will be a continued fascination with cramming advanced
stealth, tunneling, and multi-partitism into one virus, along with active
and passive anti-anti-virus code. All this will succeed in doing is guaranteeing
the viruses won't do very well off the drawing board, simply because they're
overly complex, and complexity breeds unpredictable bugginess. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think the future is for writing
viruses for WIN and OS/2? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If and when it happens in a significant manner, it won't be done by
the virus programmers we see now. They just have shown no real interest
in the effort it would take to write successful replicating code for these
operating systems. Conceptually, we should be seeing more imaginative applications
of the term 'virus'. This hasn't happened; there's been nothing really
unique for at least a year. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Whats your oppinion about the AV-community?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They're hard-scrabble businessmen with all the charm and panache of
a 60 pound bag of money-mad cockroaches. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV-program do you think it's the best?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No product endorsements from me, puh-leeze. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the underground's future?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It will continue to stumble along at about the same pace as we've seen
for the past two years. Count on more lamers, if only for the media-generated
hype about the Information Highway. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the government forbidding
virus-writing? Do you think this will help agains new infections? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I don't. Do you? Of what possible value would such a law prove against
the primary replicators FORM, STONED and JERUSALEM variants? As for newer
viruses which might - theoretically - become prominent: Anyone in the known
virus underground won't be writing them because the scene is far too well-publicized
internally. There is no window of opportunity for new viruses which come
from this quarter to spread, if someone is trying to do so. However, a
loner who keeps to himself _could_ write a virus which would have a longer
window of opportunity. If such occurs, law won't control such infections
anymore than current criminal statutes curb serial killers. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about that term computer
nerds? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's jargon stupid magazines staffed with reporter who use word processors
as manure shovels seem to like. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you considering yourself as a criminal (doing
HP?) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not even close. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your opinion about the punishment for all cyber-crimes?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The record is that punishment for cybercrime tends to be out of proportion
to actual damage done, period. Take it a step further and you realize it's
unconstitutional - remember the 'no cruel and unusual punishment' statute
in our Constitution? But hackers, actually, have it no worse than any other
of the cultural undesirables in the US - like the poor, the nuts, the sick,
foreigners, the perceived minorities, anyone under eighteen - any group
which is an easy target for unreciprocated revenge gets the chop when it
comes to unfair punishment for presumed crimes. It's a 'let's get even'
thing which is satifying to the stupid proles - even though they're targets,
too. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Something else you wish to say? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, if you think this kind of material is intriguing look for my book
on the virus underground late this year. I guarantee it'll be a good read.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you wish to send any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My friends and colleagues know who they are. </P>
