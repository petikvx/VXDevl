 Some May notice that when they use PCTOOLs (aka PCSHELL) or Peter Norton
 Utilities, or *SOME* File Managing systems like DOS-Shell, the File
 increase of infected files is know visable. There is no doubt about
 it, if you only put Method #1 in your virus you will encounter times
 were the file increase shows. Its not because your Routine isn't good!
 But due to the fact that there is another way to Read the Dir Listing
 by DOS. An this method is Call File-find by ASCIIZ format.

 We just learned how to edit File-Find by FCB. Which is used by MS-DOS
 PC-DOS and some other programs. But unlike the others, they use the
 ASCIIZ file-Find method as it is EASIER to open, close, edite, and any
 other file access routine is ALOT easier with the ASCIIZ or (File Handle)
 system. So we will make our Virus Stealth to Method #2! Making us 100%
 Stealth from file-finds...

 The Function we have to Intecept is Interrupt 21h, with Functions
 AH=4Eh (Find First Matching File) and AH=4F (Find Next Matching File)
 The Way to go about it is Very much ALIKE to the first one, so just
 understand the thoery, and you'll be able to program it within
 seconds.

 When this function is called, it will fill the current DTA with 12
 entries totally 43 bytes. The DTA will be set up as follows: (below)
 BTW: DTA is only a place DOS uses to do Disk Transfer Areas! It ISN'T
      like the FCB, or PSP that is anyways the same! You can play with
      this as you wish. You also use this DTA to read the Command Line
      Parameters...etc...

  Offset Size            Description
   -----|----|------------------------------------------
    00h | 1  | Drive Letter
    01h | 11 | Seach Template (Eg:????????COM)
    0Ch | 1  | Attribute Search
    0Dh | 2  | Entry count within Directory
    0Fh | 2  | Cluster Number of start of parent directory
    11h | 4  | Reserved (Atleast Undocumented)
    15h | 1  | Attribute of File FOUND
  @ 16h | 2  | File's Time  (Bits : SSSS-SMMM-MMMH-HHHH) Sec/2:Month:Year
    18h | 2  | File's Date  (Bits : DDDD-DMMM-MYYY-YYYY) Day:Month:Year
  * 1Ah | 4  | File's Size (Word Reverse Order, Dah!!?!)
    1Eh | 13 | ASCIIZ File name &amp; Extension
  * = Must be Edited by Virus is File Infected
  @ = Needed to Check if File is Infected. (Seconds Field)

  %Algorthm%
  ----------
     CONDISTION: DS:DX points to ASCIIZ of file search.
                 CX: Contains File Attributes

         Step 1. Call Dos so it fills the DTA with its findings
         Step 2. Test for CF=1 (Carry Flag) as error happened
                 errors happen if File not found, no more files etc...
         Step 3. Get Seconds Field And UnMask Seconds
         Step 4. Check if seconds = 58 (What ever your using) Quit if NOT
                 Notice we use `XOR  AL,1Dh' rather than `CMP   AL,1Dh'
                 Check in your ASM Bible, which is Faster? Size?
                 Remember speed &amp; size is EVERYTHING, That is why
                 My lastest are quite small viriis for stealthness!!
         Step 5. If Infected Subtract Virus Size from File
         Step 6. Quit

 ;This is the routine. once you get AH=4Eh/4Fh in you Int 21h Call this
