<hr>
<p> CyberCrime Analyst Alex Wellen spoke to Ed Borden on April 8, the day Borden's 
  client, David L. Smith, appeared in court in Aberdeen, New Jersey. State authorities 
  have charged Smith with interruption of public communications, conspiracy to 
  commit the offense, attempt to commit the offense, and third-degree theft of 
  computer service. All together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 40 years 
  in prison and a $480,000 fine. </p>
<p> 
<p> Smith was not required to answer the charges during his court appearance and 
  has not given any interviews since then. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CyberCrime</b> Have you ever had a computer-crime related client before? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well sure, I mean given the nature of our practice, I've represented 
  a number of people who are alleged to have perpetrated various crimes using 
  computers and computer equipment. Certainly I've never represented a virus writer 
  and I think that the number of prosecutions of virus writers are so small that 
  I doubt there are many other people who have either. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So, has David Smith ever written a virus before-- do you know? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well the allegation is that he is a virus writer. What the state 
  can prove remains to be seen. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> I'm not aware of a law anywhere in the world that makes it illegal 
  to simply create a virus. Do you know any? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> I'm aware of no federal or state statute that does that. The 
  way that the statues are written, they address themselves to claims that there's 
  been damage to equipment or improper access to files, improper access to various 
  compilations of data, that sort of thing.
</p>
<div align="center"><b><font size="+2">Trial Day</font></b> </div>
<p> <b>Cybercrime</b> When did you become David Smith's attorney? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Over this past weekend. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> How did that happen? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> That's a private matter between David and his lawyers. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Wasn't it public that the family asked that you represent him? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> David and his family asked that we become involved and so, to 
  that extent, sure. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> I think one thing that surprised people was your demeanor today. 
  The Melissa virus, which Smith has been accused of writing, disrupted or affected 
  a lot of people. It was very public. Do you think the case is overstated? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well I do. Certainly there have been some level of problems 
  caused by the Melissa virus-- whoever wrote it. And certainly there's been a 
  slowdown in email systems and that sort of thing, but I really think that it's 
  necessary to take a step back and ask whether all of the hype is actually justified. 
<p> 
<p> Let's talk specifically about what the Melissa virus does. &#91;It&#93; takes 
  a relatively innocuous short message and passes it on to 50 other computer users-- 
  if and only if the person who receives it overrides several protections in the 
  interim. 
<p> 
<p> It deletes no files. It corrupts no files. It reformats no drives. It removes 
  no files from any system. Doesn't change anything on a system. I certainly think 
  there were some problems caused by the virus, some slowdowns, but it's important 
  &#91;to keep&#93; some perspective on this. I think the significance of the 
  Melissa virus was how prolific it was and how fast it reproduced itself.
</p>
<div align="center"><font size="+2"><b>What Is Smith Like?</b></font><b></b> </div>
<p> <b>CyberCrime</b> The virus moved quickly, but so did the FBI and the state. 
  They came forward one week later with a name; what do you think about their 
  speed? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well the question I have, is whether the law-enforcement authorities 
  are as aggressive about pursuing viruses that actually do some specific harm. 
  Some of the permutations of the Melissa virus &#91;such as&#93; the Papa and 
  Mad Cow &#91;viruses&#93;-- as I understand from what I've read-- actually do 
  harm to systems. And I just hope that they are pursuing those with a vigor that 
  they used to pursue David Smith. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> They say their investigation is still ongoing. Moving on, how interested 
  was Smith in computers? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well David's a very bright young guy. He's been interested in 
  computers for a number of years, that's part of the work he does. And as everybody 
  seems to know, he was working for a consulting company, doing some work for 
  AT&T on a programming contract, and had been with that company for a relatively 
  short period of time. But David had an active interest in computers and had 
  some facility with that. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Do you know whether he's designed his own programs-- not specifically 
  viruses? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> No, I understand. I wouldn't want to go into the details of 
  that. Frankly, that's not a specific subject that we've gotten into yet. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> All the charges against Smith are New Jersey laws-- no federal laws. 
  What do you think about the laws he's been charged under? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well if you look at the New Jersey statutes they seem to me 
  to be focused on a couple of areas of concern. Number one is activities by hackers 
  and the like to invade systems and get access to private or secure data, law 
  enforcement files, national security files, and the like. 
<p> And number two &#91;is&#93; to prevent people from using computers to commit 
  theft. Seems to me those are the two &#91;types of&#93; activities that these 
  files are directed toward preventing and punishing. Neither of those occurred 
  here, even if you credit what the law enforcement authorities have leaked as 
  being true. None of that occurred here. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> What do you mean by leak? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well from what I've read on the Net and newspaper articles and 
  the like, it would appear that the law enforcement authorities suggest that 
  the Melissa virus had certain effects. None of those are proscribed by these 
  statutes it seems to me. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> The laws themselves may not fit what actually happened-- independent 
  from whether the activity was committed or not. Is that your position? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> That's right. Putting aside the question of how specific they 
  are and whether they meet the constitutional test to avoid challenges for vagueness. 
<p> 
<p> &#91;Furthermore,&#93; we're beginning to take a look at First Amendment issues 
  in this country. Certainly if the type of conduct here charged was of a politically 
  expressive nature, then, there would be little doubt that it's constitutionally 
  protected conduct that you can't prosecute someone for. 
<p> 
<p> I think that within the Melissa virus, whoever the author is, that there may 
  well be some element of expressive conduct that would entitle it to First Amendment 
  protection. That doesn't mean it's inherently unprosecutable, but I think it's 
  a very serious issue that we're gonna have to look at.
</p>
<div align="center"><font size="+2"><b>Are Viruses Protected Speech?</b></font><b></b> 
</div>
<p> <b>CC</b> What do you mean by First Amendment? Are you talking about the content 
  of the virus itself? Are you talking about what's being expressed? Are you talking 
  about the GUID information? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> There are a lot of off shoots and I think we have to look at 
  what the expressive conduct is. The, as you know, the message that the virus 
  sends itself is a pretty inocuous thing. It would as a message certainly be 
  protected. The bigger issue is whether the activity of the virus itself is in 
  some sense expressive. Let me ask you what it says for instance about the platforms 
  on which it operates and whether there is some element of expression in that, 
  whether it sends a message about those platforms. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> They say they only want to identify vulnerabilites that exist in 
  platforms with the intent of improving the products for everyone. Is that what 
  you're getting at? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Exactly, and whoever wrote Melissa wrote a virus, which in and 
  of itself does nothing except forward on an inocuous message, but it does point 
  out certain specific things about the platforms on which it operates, it seems 
  to me. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Do you have a message for Microsoft? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> No, I'm not attempting to convey a message to Microsoft. I'm 
  just saying that there are certainly issues that we're gonna be looking at in 
  this case as to whether or not there is at some level expressive conduct here 
  that should be protected.
</p>
<div align="center"><font size="+2"><b>Is Smith VicodinES?</b></font> </div>
<p> <b>CC</b> One of the most talked-about issues in this case is whether in fact 
  David is VicodinES. I can give you very good reasons why the two of them seem 
  like the same person, but what's your take? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> I'm familiar with that debate having seen it on the Net myself, 
  and that's certainly not an issue that we're prepared to go into now, one way 
  or another. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> You can't speak to, whether they're the same person? How do you 
  feel about VicodinES as a person? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> In the same sense that we are not talking about the evidence 
  concerning the Melissa virus, we're not prepared to respond to charges made 
  by the attorney general's office when we don't even know what their claimed 
  evidence is. We're certainly not gonna talk about matters that even they haven't 
  firmed up enough to even charge. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> And that answer doesn't necessarily answer the question whether 
  you know or don't. It's a broad answer saying, "whether I know or not, I can't 
  respond to that." Is that how I understand it? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well my answer is that we've only begun to represent David. 
  We've not gone into a lot of these allegations in any detail at all, so it's 
  much too early to address those issues. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> And what about the possibility that David is part falsely accused, 
  and only responsible for posting the virus. Maybe he knew it, and someone else 
  wrote it. 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well as you know in any kind of criminal proceeding there's 
  certain very basic stages. First, the prosecutors have to tell you what you're 
  charged with. They haven't told us that yet. We don't even know what the state 
  claims David did. We don't even have an affidavit of probable cause. So until 
  we at least know what it is that the prosecutors claim, we're certainly not 
  going to respond to an ephemeral sense of what other people think the prosecutors 
  are charging.
</p>
<div align="center"><b><font size="+2">The Legal Rules</font></b> </div>
<p> <b>CC</b> Could you have asked for a probable cause hearing, and shouldn't 
  have already have a probable cause affidavit? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well, the entirety of what we have from the state now is two 
  pages of legalese, which list the charges, has David's name, home address, date 
  of birth, and the amount of his bail. That's what we know about the state's 
  charges as of now. We don't know the probable cause affidavit. We don't have 
  any specification of what their supposed evidence is. I've learned far more 
  from a number of hours on the Net and the suppositions of various other people 
  about what the state's evidence might be then I learned today in court or have 
  learned in several days in contact with the attorney general's office. It is 
  part of the nature of the process that they're not obliged to disclose that 
  evidence at this point, but here we have some&#91;one&#93; who's subject to 
  immense public scrutiny. His life is simply torn apart. He's lost his job. His 
  family's had to post a $100,000 bail bond to keep him out of jail, the state, 
  &#91;and&#93; the attorney general's office have not come forward with the slightest 
  scintilla of evidence. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> You say they have that discretion, but in your opinion they haven't 
  shown maybe the level of decency that might accompany such a big case? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> It's certainly not an uncommon tack for them to take. And you 
  must understand that there are certain types of criminal investigations where 
  they would want to withhold evidence for good and proper reasons. I'm not sure 
  that this is such a case. That's a question only they can answer. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So when do you find out anything? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> They are not obliged to give us anything until after the case 
  is indicted. The determination when to indict it, if at all, is entirely up 
  to the attorney general's office. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So then they can indict him a year from now? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> They can indict him four years and 11 1/2 months from now. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Why's that? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Statute of limitations is five years. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Is that the rule in all states, or is it unique in New Jersey? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> It's essentially the federal rule as well. I mean in federal 
  court the difference is that before someone can be held on bail, they're entitled 
  to a probable cause hearing. Now that's a very low standard in federal court 
  and can be sustained with a lawyer giving some sort &#91;of&#93; specification 
  of what the evidence is, but at least you have that. We don't even have that 
  here. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Can you ask for a probable cause hearing? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Sure, in New Jersey as elsewhere, defendants &#91;are&#93; constitutionally 
  entitled to a probable cause hearing at some point. There is case law in New 
  Jersey that kind of goes back and forth about when a defendant is entitled to 
  that. Certainly not terribly quickly, and I would expect if we filed such a 
  motion now it would be deferred and a probable cause hearing would be deferred 
  in order to give the state sufficient time to indict if they chose to do so. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So you sit and wait right now? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> That's right. Well we obviously prepare our case. We ruminate 
  about what the charges may be and we do a lot of hard work to get ready. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> And how's David doing? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> He's doing OK. Today was our day. It was really a substantial 
  crush of media out there, but David's OK. And I think he's gonna stay strong 
  through this and I think we're gonna be all right. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> You thought this was going to be a two-day thing, do you still feel 
  that way? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well, I thought it would be a two-day story. I certainly didn't 
  think it would be a two-day prosecution. There are no such things. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> It was crazy out there. Did you expect that? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well, we had certainly done some checking, and the level of 
  media attention certainly led me to believe that it was gonna be substantial. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Is there anything that you would add that I didn't hit upon? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Borden</b> Well, the one thing that I would add is that it's really a fascinating 
  case with a great deal at stake. I mean a young man's life and future are at 
  stake here. Obviously not his life physically, but his future is. He had a very 
  promising future until a few days ago, and our job will &#91;be to&#93; see 
  that he gets that future back.
