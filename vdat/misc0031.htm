<P align="center"> <font size="-1">This article originally appeared in the Sept 
  16th, 1999 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. </font></P>
<hr>
<P>It's three in the morning on the internet relay chat channel #codebreakers, 
  and Opic is waiting. It has taken a week of cryptic e-mail missives, bounced 
  around the world and back again via a chain of anonymous remailers, to arrange 
  this meeting, but the enigmatic twenty one-year old is here when he said he 
  would be. "Sorry about all the confusion," he types. His welcome appears on 
  the screen after a slight lag, a symptom of the proxy servers he's routing himself 
  through to cloak the address of his internet service provider. </P>
<P> Opic is a "coder", part of a ten man internet virus-exchange (VX) group known 
  as <a href="groups1.htm#CB">CodeBreakers</a>. He writes computer viruses. In 
  and of itself, this isn't a pursuit that would require anyone to go into hiding. 
  Writing viruses is perfectly legal in the United States. </P>
<P>
Intentionally spreading a virus to unwitting computer users, though --
thats a prosecutable offense. Especially if that virus turns out to be
the fastest spreading piece of self-replicating code in history. You
wouldn't want to be linked to someone even suspected of pulling a stunt
like that. This is why Opic and other members of CodeBreakers have been
so skittish lately.
</P><P>
Computer viruses are small, parasitic programs that attach themselves to
other programs and reproduce. They've been around since the
mid-Eighties, but the general public didn't become aware of them until
1992, When the data gobbling Michaelangelo became the first "celebrity"
virus. Ten years ago, there were only about thirty known computer
viruses. Today, according to Symantec and Network Associates, the top
antivirus software companies in the United States, there are some 40,000
viruses in existance.
</P><P>
Anything that a virus does besides replicate is called it's payload.
Some viruses contain no payload at all and can reside on a PC for years
without being detected. Others display jokey screen messages, print text
or play music. Some viruses cause gradual, insidious corruption of data
files; others like dormant throughout the year and then destroy files or
reformat hard drives when a certain date rolls around.
</P><P>
Viruses that permanently wipe out files or erase hard drives are the
least common type. Still, virus researchers contend that there is no
such thing as a benign virus. Even some "non-malicious" viruses are so
sloppily programmed that they result in software malfunctions, crashes
and file corruptions not intended by their authors. Theoretically, if a
virus was buggy enough to disrupt the day-to-day operations of a crucial
machine or network- say that of a hospital or an airtraffic control
system - and happened to hit on a day when that organization's backup
system was down, even the most harmless virus would have the potential
to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P> This spring Microsoft users everywhere met <a href="misc0030.htm">Melissa</a>, 
  a technically harmless - it contained no data destroying payload - but alarmingly 
  prolific Word 97 macro virus. Among the viruses known to be actively spreading 
  today, macro viruses are the most common. They are written in the Visual Basic 
  for Applications programming language included in the popular software package 
  Microsoft Office - the user-friendliness of which makes viruses fairly easy 
  for even non-programmers to create - and travel via infected Microsoft Word 
  or Excel Documents. </P>
<P>
Melissa upped the ante for virus spreading. Instead of relying on users
themselves to transfer the infected documents from machine to machine
via disk or email, the virus operated like a chain letter from hell,
corrupting Word documents and, if Microsoft Outlook e-mail software was
installed on an infected machine, peeking into the user's address book
and sending e-mails - each with an infected document attached - to the
first fifty addresses found.
</P>
<P> Melissa clogged email gateways, panicked PC users and sparked an <a href="misc0028.htm">FBI 
  manhunt</a> that at least initially pointed to a retired member of the CodeBreakers 
  known as VicodinES. Vic, as he's known in the clannish virus underground, was 
  first linked to Melissa when simularities were discovered between Melissa, and 
  an earlier virus PSD2000, that he had created and that was available for download 
  on his Website. The FBI began sniffing around the CodeBreakers a few days after 
  Melissa surfaced, shutting down two Web sites containing viruses written by 
  VicodinES: CodeBreakers.org, the groups own site, and SourceOfKaos.com, a domain 
  that hosted Vic's personal site. </P>
<P>
Working from logs provided by America Online, investigators later traced
the usenet post that triggered Melissa's joy ride to a thirty year old
Aberdeen, New Jersey programmer named David L. Smith. Smith now faces
charges that could carry a maximum penalty of fourty-years in prison and
$480,000 in fines.
</P>
<P> Authorities have yet to reveal whether Smith and VicodinES are one and the 
  same. The CodeBreakers have maintaining from the beginning that Melissa was 
  neither written nor spread by Vic. Rather, they say, Smith simply cobbled Melissa 
  together out of two earlier viruses, one of them Vic's PSD2000. This is entirely 
  possible: <a href="tradgrps.htm">Files containing viruses are swapped like trading 
  cards</a> on the Internet, and coders often modify existing viruses to create 
  their own new mutations. </P>
<P> Interest in the group on the part of law enforcement appears to have cooled 
  in the months since Smith's arrest. So aside from the precautions they take 
  to protect their identities, the CodeBreakers have returned to business as usual. 
  They're still writing viruses, still making them available to anyone who cares 
  to download them via an electronic zine, <a href="ezines1.htm#CODE">CodeBreakers 
  VX zine</a>, Edited by Opic. "After much internal dialogue," he explained in 
  the zines first post-Melissa issue, the CodeBreakers had simply decided to "continue 
  doing what they have always done: find new, innovative and interesting viral 
  techniques." </P>
<P>
Opic has agreed to this late night chat not because he is eager to
rehash the Melissa sordidness but he because he was approached with what
for him must have been a powerful lure: genuine curiosity about why he -
or anyone - writes viruses.
</P><P>
Sarah Gordon, an anti-virus researcher with IBM who has been studying
virus writers for nearly a decade, says it's impossible to tell how many
coders are currently practicing, because many never tell anyone about
their activities. She conservatively estimates that there are several
hundred writers with a presense on the Net and that they make up roughly
fifteen "active, findable" VX groups. Of those writers, only a small
minority are very prolific. "There are always the little cliques and
clubs that don't get the attention," she says.
</P><P>
Coders come in all different stripes, and their motivations and ethics
vary widely. For every stereotypical fifteen year old bully who writes
nothing but data destroying code that he e-mails to his enemies, there's
also a middle aged Silicon Valley exec who downloads a virus from the
internet, plays with it out of idle curiosity and accidentally infects
his firms network.
</P><P>
Opic would seem to fall somewhere between those two extremes. A college
student who focuses on the arts, he's been writing viruses for two
years. He has no formal computer training; he's entirely self-taught. He
usually reveals his interest in viruses to his girlfriends (if only to
explain the long hours he spends at the keyboard), but his parents and
other relatives don't know about it. ("Why involve loved ones who don't
need to be involved?" he asks.)
</P><P>
Opic got his start by hacking into local university systems with a
friend. Once he began learning about viruses, he was hooked. "I found it
fascinating that I could actually make this computer do what I wanted,"
he types, "that I could write something that would travel from computer
to computer. It's a classical art concept, playing God and all."
</P><P>
According to Gordon, many coders see what they do as a creative
endeaver. At least one virus writer with whom she has had extensive
contact, a Bulgarian coder known as Dark Avenger, channels his emotions
into his code the way an artist would channel them into a painting.
</P><P>
"There was a certain frantic yet very deliberate way that he wrote his
programs," Gordon remembers, "Some of the things that he'd put in the
source code would just lead you around and around through this maze. And
then there would be this part where the code was very calm, laid out
very methodically. It was really interesting to see that during the
times when things were really confusing in his life, he was writing code
that if you looked at it, was like looking at a pile of spaghetti."
</P><P>
Opic is more imaginative then most coders. Instead of the requisite Iron
Maiden lyrics or "Too bad, lamer!" brag messages, he salts his viruses
with Fugazi lyrics and snippits of his own peotry. ("There is a path to
the transcendence of the dollar: Embark rich beggars...."). Opic doesn't
write data destroying viruses; a user whose pc is infected by one of his
programs is more likely to be annoyed by pesky text messages that appear
on a given day of the month or to be haunted by a printer with a mind of
it's own. "I'm into making points through ambiguity, rather than the
tried and true 'in-your-face' method," he says.
</P><P>
Most of the viruses he's writing these days are "proof of concept"
programs, created to shine a big embarrasing spotlight on software
vulnerabilities. One such virus is Caligula, the bit of code for which
Opic is most widely known. A word macro virus, Caligula searches for the
file containing a user's private encryption key - the key that enables
users of the popular Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) utility to decode their
encrypted documents and e-mail and uploads it to Opic's FTP site.
</P><P>
Opic says he had no intention of using the files to gain access to
anyone's encoded documents. "I had no interest in impersonating or
violating anyone or debunking PGP, which is a great asset to myself and
millions of others," he says. "But it was vulnerable due to Microsoft's
platform and some lazy or non-security conscious programmers. Had I not
coded it, it's possible that someone with more malicious intentions
would have."
</P><P>
Gordon says she's heard that argument from virus writers before. She
views it as an attempt to legitimize irresponsible behavior. "if that's
what you have in mind," says Gordon, "there are more responsible ways of
working toward solving such problems rather than just posting something
on the Internet and saying, 'Oh, here's a new problem; so that everybody
in the world can go out and exploit it."
</P><P>
Opic concedes that in making their viruses available to anyone who's
curious enough to seek them out, VXers do play a role in any damage
caused by programs that fall into the hands of individuals with
malicious intentions. But he counters, it's "an indirect role in the
same manner that gun manufacturers play a role in thousands of murders
each year." Still, why wouldn't Opic consider contacting a software
manufacturer discretely when he's written a virus aimed at
vulnerabilities in that vendors product?
</P><P>
"Ever tried it?" he asks, "That's obviously the least intrusive route,
but it doesn't work. The world is overrun by bureaucracy." He points to
Caligula as an example. "What I did was nothing new," he says. "Many
have known it was possible; many people in fact, have written and
published papers on the problem. But no one did anything about it until
I illustrated the point."
</P><P>
Rob Rosenberger - a security expert whose Web site, Computer Virus
Myths, attempts to educate consumers about hoaxes and media hype related
to viruses - says he believes that a small minority of virus writers do
ultimately contribute to the greater good. "This is a controversial
opinion," Says Rosenberger, "but I really think the guys who are writing
at the state of the art should be left alone to do what they do,
because they also force an advancement in the antivirus-world. They make
the world more secure."
</P><P>
Not all viruses are inspired by security holes. Sometimes personal
politics turn up between the lines of code. One of Opic's favorite
creations, Koyyanisqati, was a macro virus that launched a "ping flood"
attack - a barrage of data packets that overloads servers and disrupts
internet connections - on four different websites. Two of the sites were
devoted to kiddie porn; the other two were racist hangouts. Koyyanisqati
Opic says, was his "attempt at a 'good' virus." Still, he can understand
why someone like Sarah Gordon wouldn't see it as an achievement. "I
suspect she would agree with my feelings in case, but not my methods,"
he says.
</P><P>
Gordon is one of the few people in anti-virus (AV) circles who deign to
hobnob with the VXers, and though they don't always agree with her
opinions, most coders who have met her view her with respect. She and
Opic have been engaging in lengthy e-mail debates about virus writing
lately. "She's very open," he says of her. "She's the only AVer I've met
who is willing to actually discuss things rather than just sit around and
mudsling." Many VXers despise those who work for anti-virus-software
vendors, claiming that they exaggerate the threat virus writers
represent in order to sell more software. "It's part of the deal," says
Opic. "They have to demonize us in order to capitalize on the computer
virus phobia that users have."
</P><P>
There's no question that the anti-virus-software industry - which has
retail sales that are predicted to reach $1 billion by 2002 - stands to
gain from nurturing virus hysteria. Anytime the threat of an especially
sexy virus surfaces, the anti-virus companies race to develop fixes,
issue "virus alerts" and bend the ears of quote-hungry reports. And
invariable, after a virus outbreak that recieves national media
attention, there is a subsequent spike in anti-virus-software sales:
According to the Reston Virginia, computer-industry market research firm
PC Data Inc., virus-protection-software sales increased by more than
sixty-seven percent between March 28th and April 3rd, at the height of
the Melissa scare. Most users know so little about the reality of
viruses that it's easy for AV vendors to indulge in gloomy hyperbole to
gain an edge.
</P><P>
"The threat of virus infection is now greater than ever!" claims the
Product webpage for VirusScan at McAfee.com. "The need to protect your
PC has become vital, as there are now over 40,000 known computer
viruses, with more than 300 new viruses being created each month."
</P>
<P> Figures like that strike fear into the heart of PC users. What most of them 
  don't realize is that of the estimated 40,000 viruses in existence, only about 
  150 are currently known to be actively spreading. The rest are cooped up in 
  anti-virus research labs. And while AV firms often incorporate terms like deadly, 
  dangerous and malicious into their sales literature, only a small minority of 
  viruses pose any real threat to a user's data. A quick look at the July <a href="misc0004.htm">wildlist</a>, 
  a monthly tabulation of viruses known to be "in the wild," provides a more realistic 
  picture. Total number of viruses known to be actively spreading: 132. And of 
  the eighteen most common viruses reported in the July Wildlist, only three - 
  CIH, ExploreZip and One_Half - destroy data. </P>
<P>
There's an interesting symbiosis between VXers and AVers. The members of
each group generally profess to despise the members of the other, but
both groups in a sense are dependant on each other. Virus Writers need
the antivirus industry to challenge them as well as to provide them with
notoriety. In VX circles, having the antidote to your virus latest virus
turn up in a new release of Norton AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan
entitles you to major bragging rights. In turn, virus writers are fond
of pressing the notion that they keep an entire industry employed.
</P><P>
The friction between the two groups can be intense; frequent bickering
matches erupt on Usenet newsgroups such as alt.comp.virus and
comp.virus. The AVer's favorite ploy is to hit coders in the ego,
accusing them of shoddy programming skills. Every once in a while, a
coder strikes back. Nick Fitzgerald, a consulting editor for Virus
Bulletin Magazine, once made the mistake of publicly scorning a virus
writer for his "pathetic" programming abilities and later found himself
on the recieving end of a creation called Cold Ape. A.k.a The Love
Monkey Virus. Users infected by ColdApe unwittingly sent e-mails to
Fitzgerald's address at Virus Bulletin, informing him that they wanted
to make "hot monkey love" to him. Fitzgerald says that ColdApe cost him
and Virus Bulletin "hundreds of hours" of work.
</P><P>
"If you did make this virus then first off, damn you," reads a June 2nd
Usenet post by one Marcin Mirski. "And second, how can I get my infected
files back?"
</P>
<P> Messages like this turn up fairly often in the alt.comp.virus newsgroup. Mirski 
  has come to the group to ask about the happy faces that keep showing up on his 
  screen when he's using Windows 98. The happy faces, he reported in an earlier 
  post, are accompanied by a message reading, "Oops! I've got such terrible munchies. 
  TERMiTE v1.0 RAiD [SLAM]". </P>
<P> Within twenty-four hours, Mirski's query has been answered with a post by 
  <a href="ivraidsl.htm">RAiD</a>, the proud papa of TERMiTE, a.k.a. HLLP.5000. 
  "Isn't he kewl?" asks RAiD in his response. "Have you seen my graphical payload 
  yet? Does it look like crawling termites to you? Have you seen my other payload 
  yet? You're still here, so I guess not." </P>
<P>
Other posters add to the thread, explaining to Mirski the steps he needs
to follow to get rid of TERMiTE. before it launches the randomly
triggered second payload, which will wipe his hard drive. In the midst
of advice giving, David Chess, a highly respected antivirus researcher
with IBM, pointedly addresses TERMiTE's author: "Just out of curiosity,
RAiD, did you feel any impulse whatsoever to apologize to Mr. Mirski for
having written a damaging virus in the first place?"
</P><P>
"None Whatsoever," RAiD fires back. "I'm rather proud of that virus, why
on earth would I apologize for something it was designed to do? Mind
you, I didn't expect it to get as far as it has, but that's neither here
nor there."
</P>
<P> A member of the VX group <a href="groups2.htm#SLAM">Slam</a> and one of the 
  loudest, most unrepentant coders on the Net, RAiD is the kind of virus writer 
  who makes antivirus workers - and often other virus writers - gnash their teeth 
  in frustation. He's the guy who pops into the mind of PC users as they nervously 
  scan their disks with AV software. Not only does he write viruses with malicious 
  payloads, he also takes a fairly obvious measure of delight in watching them 
  spread. </P>
<P>
What drives coders like RAiD? During an informal late-night Internet
Relay Channel chat, he offered several clues. While his buddies - guys
with handles like CyberYoda and VirusBust and Knowdeth - were
standoffish RAiD was clearly itching for a piece of the spotlight. He
expressed doubt about whether or not his comments would be accurately
reported, writing that "the media have made us out to be villians," but
he couldn't seem to resist sharing his views anyway. "Personally, I'm
interested in exploits," he wrote, "and new ways to infect things. if it
can be infected, I want to infect it. Not to cause harm to people," he
added, "but to see if I can."
</P><P>
Two days later, an Anonymous email arrives, with a file "toad10.zip" -
attached. "You get a sneak peak of the next virus that will be released
eight hours from now," it reads. "You'll find it's a bit more
complicated than a Word Macro virus, while enabling excellent worm
functions."
</P><P>
"Because of the way it works," the missive continues, " the entire world
will see it. Er, well, I hope." The message is signed, "Regards, RAiD
[SLAM]"
</P><P>
As of yet, the entire world hasn't seen Toadie, RAiD's latest virus. But
a few people have, By late July, posts under the subject header "REQ
Toadie v1.0 Help" began cropping up in alt.comp.virus, and RAiD is
happily holding court.
</P><P>
"Does anyone have any concrete reports on how far and widespread the
Toadie virus is?" he asks. "We've seen four or possibly five people on
Usenet infected, but has anyone been able to actually confirm any
infection?"
</P><P>
"RAiD, I like your style," someone quips the next day. "I compare this
to pissing through someone's letter box and then knocking on the door
and politely asking, 'How far did it go?'"
</P><P>
According to Opic, RAiD is in the minority of virus writers today, one
of a small number who are unapologetic about "opening [Pandora's] box
and loving it." From what she's seen of RAiD's activities, Sarah Gordon
agrees. "He's not very representative at all of the current crop," she
says.
</P>
<P> "There are malicious people out there, but they're not accepted around us," 
  says Evul, a twenty-nine-year-old coder from the group <a href="groups2.htm#UCSI">Ultimate 
  Chaos</a>, whose members frequently associate with the CodeBreakers. "With me, 
  it's about creating and sharing your creativity, as opposed to maliciously or 
  subversively using it on somebody." Spooky, 17, one of Opic's compatriots in 
  CodeBreakers, quit writing in April, when he examined the log files sent back 
  to him by one of his viruses, marker, and learned that it had infected organizations 
  like Blue Cross- Blue Shield. "There have to be limits, and I think I have found 
  mine," he explained on his Web site at the time. </P>
<P>
Most people find it surprising that virus writers have any moral or
ethical boundaries. When Gordon presents her research on VXers at
industry conventions, she says, most of her audiences view virus writers
as "Antisocial kids with no girlfriends," They're shocked to learn that
in tests of ethical development, coders are usually withen the norms for
their ages. "A lot of the people who do this are, in all aspects,
normal, decent people," says Gordon.
</P><P>
Virus Writers who do happen to witness firsthand the human pain and
problems wrought by a digital catastrophe often become ex-virus writers
very quickly. "On a computer, you don't have contextual clues," Gordon
explains. "People lose touch, and they don't realize the impact they're
having on another persion. It's very possible that sometimes when virus
writers say, 'Viruses don't really hurt people,' they believe that. They
haven't seen that other person crying because they lost their thesis."
</P>
<P> <a name="SB"></a>The most public guilt-induced defection to the VX underground 
  has seen in recent years was that of <a href="specialc.htm#SB">Mike Ellison</a>, 
  a.k.a. <a href="ivsbring.htm">Stormbringer</a>, a former member of the <a href="groups2.htm#PS">Phalcon/Skism</a> 
  group. Ellison was fourteen and already interested in computer programming when 
  the Stoned virus turned up on his machine. (One of the oldest known viruses, 
  Stoned displays the message "Your PC is now Stoned!" on start-up.) At the time, 
  he says, viruses were "mysterious, something you kinda had to learn on your 
  own from disassembling them." He and a friend studied Stoned to see how it worked, 
  and before long he was experimenting with a virus of his own. Ellison still 
  remembers the day he wrote his first successful virus. "It was a bit of a rush," 
  he says. </P>
<P>
"Viruses are unique and quite interested in that they can travel without
additional human intervention." Creating such a thing, he adds, is "a
pretty neat feeling when you're that young."
</P>
<P> By the time he was sixteen, Ellison was a card-carrying member of Phalcon/Skism 
  as well as a second ground, the <a href="groups2.htm#THETRIN">Trinity</a>; he 
  had a respectable rep in the underground and had written a slew of viruses. 
  As Stormbringer, he wrote Key Kapture II, designed to capture the keystrokes 
  made by a user and save them on any writable drive when the drive was changed. 
  Writing for the Trinity, he produced Crucifixion, a virus that activated only 
  when a user hit CONTROL-ALT-DELETE on Sundays in March or April; once deployed, 
  the virus displayed a picture of Jesus on a cross, accompanied by music and 
  animated sing along lyrics: "If your the Messiah and you know it, clap your 
  hands." ("What can I say?" says Ellison. "I was bored.") </P>
<P> Ellison says that the members of Phalcon/Skism, with "one or two notable exceptions," 
  were "very much against writing destructive code. That wasn't the point. The 
  point was to learn and explore, and occasionally to one-up each other and other 
  groups with skill." Although he did publish the source code for his viruses 
  in the Phalcon/Skism zine, <a href="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40hex</a>, he never let 
  live viruses stray from his own machine. For the length of his tenure with the 
  group, he believed that the only outside copies of his viruses existed in anti-virus 
  research labs. </P>
<P>
"I really didn't think any of my viruses would ever be seen in the
wild," he says. "At the time, I didn't worry too much about publishing
the source of my viruses, either. For one thing, I wanted to provide
information and techniques to other virus writers and anyone else who
was interested. But also, I really didn't expect some random loser to
compile one of my viruses and go off infecting machines with it."
</P><P>
Reality hit in 1994 when Ellison was contacted by a user whose system
had been zapped by Key Kapture II. A third party had acquired Ellison's
source code, compiled it and loaded the virus onto the user's machine.
When Key Kapture II began filling up the hopeless user's hard drive with
captured keystrokes and he discovered he had only two megs of space left
on his disk, he e-mailed Ellison to find out how to get rid of the
virus. Ellison phoned the fellow to help him disinfect his machine.
Today he describes that conversation as "traumatic."
</P>
<P> "It really shocked me," he says, adding that he felt "very depressed and guilty." 
  to learn that he had "somehow unintentionally managed to hurt someone on the 
  opposite side of the world who had done nothing to me." Even worse, as Ellison 
  later noted in a post on the Net, the Key Kapture-infected user "was kind, almost 
  like he didn't really blame me... For some reason, this really shook me." Ellison 
  quit Phalcon/Skism the next day, <a href="misc0032.htm">posting a public retirement 
  letter on the Net</a>. </P>
<P>
Today, Ellison, 23, works as a software developer in Texas, "I've lost
quite a few weekends myself cleaning up after viruses that found their
way into companies," he says. "And while I've never seen a real loss of
data, the lost man-hours and trust of the users in their computers is
substantial."
</P><P>
Ellison still believes that "writing a virus in and of itself is in no
way wrong." But, he adds, "allowing it to spread into the wild, either
by one's own hand, which is malicious, or by another's, which I see as
negligent, is."
</P><P>
Asked how he views the currently active VX groups in terms of their
collective ethical mind-set, Ellison says the prevalent attitude today
is "rebellious but not intentionally destructive. There are a handful of
people who go into it with the intent of destroying random people's hard
drives and others who basically feel that they are spraying the
electronic equivalent of graffiti." Still others, he adds, genuinely do
feel that they are serving the greater good. "People trust computers and
technology too much, when so few really understand them," Ellison points
out. "Viruses, by that view provide a destablizing force to remedy
such unfounded trust."
</P><P>
Nick Fitzgerald claims that maliciousness in virus writing circles or,
as he puts it, the "screw them over and trash their data" ethic - has
become increasingly common within the last two or three years. But to
Opic and his friends, the public image of the "typical" virus writer as
a cyberterrorist hellbent on inflicting harm is just plain passe.
According to Opic, few of the writers he knows are still interested in
creating viruses that destroy data; the wave of the future is programs
that collect it. The PGP-key stealing capabilities of Caligula, he says,
merely scratch the surface in terms of what is possible.
</P><P>
Virus writers he points out, would not be such a threat to the computing
public if it weren't for the constant dumbing down of PC technology - a
result of the ever-increasing consumer demand for more-automated,
user-friendly software and the eagerness of companies like Microsoft to
meet it. There are a number of unsettling advances on the horizon that
play into this dynamic. The VX community is now exploring viruses that
propagate via programming languages like HTML, and Java, which are
commonly used to write Web pages. Executable code can be embedded into
HTML files, and because some newer communications programs automatically
execute HTML when it's found in an e-mail, it's conceivable that viruses
could be spread simply by users' viewing their mail. Java, says Opic,
presents the possibility of "remote and automatic infection" - ie, visit
a Website containing infected Java files, now you're infected. New
internet languages create the possibility, Opic says, for "global
infection in hours. A virus can spread to millions of computers before
anyone even suspects there's a problem."

Asked if he can understand why most people find that idea scary, Opic
says they should find it scary. Still, he contends that virus writers
and their creations are only a symptom; the problem itself is the
"overall development mentality" - namely, the low priority given to
security issues by software manufacturers like Microsoft - that allows
them to flourish. As long as there are operating systems and software
programs with vulnerabilities that can be exploited, virus writers are
going to exploit them - sometimes for no better reason than the fact
that they can.

<P> It's five in the morning, and lines of text are still marching across the 
  screen. "Humans are almost forced to open Pandora's box at times," Opic writes. 
  A few seconds later, a server message appears in the chat window: "Opic has 
  set the topic on channel #codebreakers to 'Curiosity Killed the cat.'" </P>
