<hr>
<p>Anti-virus firms are warning of a new computer virus that spreads through Internet 
  chat rooms and updates itself automatically with files from the Web. </p>
<p> &quot;This is the tip of the iceberg,&quot; on Tuesday said Eric Chien, senior 
  researcher for anti-virus software maker Symantec Corp., who stressed that the 
  virus' capacity to upgrade itself makes it a concern. &quot;Virus writers again 
  are using more network-centric ideas to create viruses.&quot; </p>
<p>Symantec (Nasdaq: SYMC) has only encountered two dozen reports of the virus, 
  dubbed W95.Babylonia, since it was discovered on Friday, Dec. 3. Another security 
  firm, Computer Associates Inc. (NYSE: CA), has only encountered 15 reports so 
  far. Currently, the virus infects executible (.EXE) and help (.HLP) files. </p>
<p>While the computer virus has not spread widely and currently has no dangerous 
  payload, anti-virus experts fear that a better-written clone could be more effective 
  in the future. </p>
<p>Or, just as bad for users, the virus writer could decide to add a new payload 
  to the virus. Unique in that it looks at a virus-exchange Web site in Japan 
  for updates, Babylonia is actually just an 11KB program that spreads itself 
  when an infected file is opened and transfers updates from the Web when the 
  host machine is online. </p>
<p><b>Virus downloads four modules</b></p>
<p> The current version downloads four modules from the Japanese virus-exchange 
  site. The first module is just another copy of the virus, which could update 
  the virus. The second module is a text file that replaces the autoexec.bat file 
  on the host computer with a new one containing the message:</p>

  <pre>     W95/Babylonia by Vecna (c) 1999 
     Greetz to RoadKil and VirusBuster 
     Big thankz to sok4ever webmaster 
     Abracos pra galera brazuca!!! 
     --- 
     Eu boto fogo na Babilonia! </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The text identifies the writer as Vecna, which Symantec claims is a member 
  of a Latin America virus group known as <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a> (or 
  666 in hexadecimal). The <a href="specialc.htm#BB">Bubbleboy</a> virus was allegedly 
  created by <a href="ivzulubb.htm">Zulu</a>, another member of the 29A group. 
</p>
<p> The third module sends an e-mail message to a Hotmail account established 
  to count the number of computers infected by Babylonia. And the fourth module 
  contains code that causes infected users who use mIRC chat software to send 
  a copy of the virus to everyone in the chat room using the DCC file transfer 
  feature of mIRC. </p>
<p>In most cases, the chat software will notify the recipients that someone is 
  sending them a file. However, users that have DCC downloading set to &quot;automatic&quot; 
  will receive no notification. Unless the file, which parades as a Y2K bug fix 
  (not coincidentally called Y2k bug fix.exe), is run, the user's computer will 
  not be infected with the virus. </p>
<p>However, any or all of these aspects of the virus could change. The writer 
  could add a new set of updates to the Web to change the copies of the virus 
  already infecting users' machines, tweak the methods the virus uses to spread, 
  or even add a destructive payload. </p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow, it could be using Outlook to spread,&quot; said Symantec's 
  Chien, referring to a number of recent viruses, including Melissa and ExploreZip, 
  that have spread by sending themselves using Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) Outlook 
  and its address book. </p>
<p>Ironically, the ability to update a virus resembles the LiveUpdate technology 
  that Symantec uses to keep its virus scanner in touch with the times. The ability 
  to upgrade is one that has been used by the software industry for a few years 
  to fix applications over the Net. </p>
<p><b>Problematic for home users</b></p>
<p> &quot;At this point, it is a proof of concept,&quot; said Narender Mangalam, 
  director of security products for Computer Associates. &quot;It spreads through 
  chat rooms, it will mainly be a problem for home users, who tend to be more 
  lax about security.&quot; </p>
<p>The current form of the virus can be detected by searching for a file called 
  Babylonia.exe on any questionable computer. In addition, computers that show 
  the aforementioned message at start up should be considered infected. </p>
<p>Just remember, however: Tomorrow, all bets are off -- the symptoms could change.

<hr>
<p>The Webmaster of a Japanese Web page that collects computer virus information 
  has removed the Babylonia virus from the site, saying , &quot;Its activity doesn't 
  match my policy.&quot; The new virus attracted researchers' attention because 
  it was clever enough to sneak onto a victim's computer in pieces and update 
  itself with fresh code.</p>
<p> The first piece of the Babylonia virus - called the &quot;stub&quot; by researchers 
  - can arrive posing as a Y2K fix. Once a user is tricked into opening it, the 
  other four pieces were pulled into the victim's computer from the infamous virus-hosting 
  Web site located in Japan.</p>
<p>By Tuesday morning, 25 customers of the antivirus firm Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq: 
  SYMC) were infected by W95.Babylonia, and about 25 Network Associates customers 
  had also been infected.</p>
<p><b>Risk evaluation</b></p>
<p>The &quot;payload&quot; is not serious: The program does not attempt to delete 
  or copy user files, and so far the virus has been transmitted principally in 
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) rooms. But Symantec says the risk is serious anyway.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;This doesn't do the damage of a worm.explorer.zip, for example, but we're 
  still worried,&quot; Symantec researcher Eric Chien said. &quot;At this very 
  second the virus writer could be putting up new code on the Web site that will 
  reformat your drive.&quot;</p>
<p>Victims who contract the virus have their computers directed to the Web site 
  hosted in Japan that is no longer operating; it was apparently authored by a 
  member of the &quot;29A&quot; virus writing group.</p>
<p>After initial infection, three additional pieces were downloaded to the victim's 
  computer, according to Symantec. The second piece modifies the virus to display 
  a message on boot-up; the third turns the virus into a worm that spreads over 
  IRC; and the fourth sends e-mail to babylonia_counter@hotmail.com, probably 
  so the virus writers can follow the program's infection rate.</p>
<p><b>Dual benefits</b></p>
<p> There are two advantages to splitting up the virus. First, the initial download 
  is small, making infection more likely. Second, the author can later choose 
  to change the virus and add a more destructive payload. Chien said the virus 
  might also be changed to circumvent detection by antivirus products. </p>
<p> &quot;It's the first we've ever seen that actually contacts a Web site to 
  gather more pieces for itself,&quot; Chien said. A Java-based virus named BeanHive 
  attempted the strategy in the past but never caused any real infections, he 
  said. &quot;This is the first we've seen that's effective.&quot;</p>
<p>The virus is unique in other ways. It's the first that's able to infect Windows 
  help files, according to Vince Gullotto, director of Network Associates ' anti-virus 
  research team. Gullotto was also concerned the initial virus will act like an 
  application programming interface, allowing multiple program authors to &quot;update&quot; 
  its payload.</p>
<p>&quot;This guy wrote it, but the rest of his mates in 29A could be writing 
  other applications as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An infected machine will display the message: &quot;W95/Babylonia by Vecna 
  (c) 1999 Greetz to <a href="tradgrps.htm#ROADKIL">RoadKil</a> and <a href="tradgrps.htm#VTC">VirusBuster</a>
