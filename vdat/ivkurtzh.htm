<UL>
<P>Well, born on the 15.12.1972, I am currently studying electrical engineering
at the University of Wuppertal. Beside studying and working on my AV programs
I like to hang around on IRC (molesting people on #virus is sometimes quite
funny :) ), read books (all kind of SF and fantasy, I prefer to read the
original English versions because the German translations are mostly very
bad), listening to music (EBM and Wave, mostly electronical things but
I actually hate Techno (ARGH!) and similar rubbish), playing computer games
(preferring network games, I usually only play (GL)Quake, and if the German
Telekom will be able to install ISDN here within this century, I will most
likely join one of the Quake clans :) ) and such things. </P>

<P>I got my first computer at the fall of 1986, of course a Commodore 64.
:) After about 6 months I came to the conclusing that coding Assembler
is by far superior to BASIC (I noticed that in ASM, you can change screen
colors within every rasterline :) ) and started learning Assembler. I was
busy coding demos and games on the C64, visiting demo parties and such
things until the end of 1991 when I got my first PC, a 80286/16 MHz with
4 MB of RAM and a 85 MB HDD. After about some weeks I caught my first PC
virus, Flash.688.A and was at once fascinated by the idea behind it. I
started to learn 80x86 assembler language and disassmbled every virus I
could find on the computers around, such as Flash, Stoned, Parity_Boot.B,
Tequila (that one was funny, I didn`t realize at that time that Tequila
infects both MBR and EXE files and low-level formated my HDD almost every
day to get rid of the virus :) ), Form and other common viruses. I also
started to write my first AV program, SYANBOOT at that time, followed by
SSC, SVS, SCRC, SDISK and MEMCHK (the SUSPICIOUS package). From the beginning
I was prefering all kind of generic virus detection and I focused on writing
heuristic detections. When the first macro viruses for Winword poped up
1995, I started to write a heuristic scanner for macro viruses, F/WIN.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many years have you been part of the anti
virus scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Since 1992. I wish I had the chance to join earlier because the really
interesting time was around 1987-1991. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What was your your first av program? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I didn`t wrote any Stoned cleaner :) (at the time I started with
AV, Stoned was almost extinct and I only found it on some *very* old 360
KB disks). My first AV program was &quot;SYANBOOT&quot;, some boot protection
tool that stored copies of the MBR and the bootsector and used saved interrupt
vectors to bypass stealth bootviruses. It was very simple, but I kept the
ugly color scheme for my programs until today. :) And like all my programs
it was written in Assembler. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have sales of your AV products increased or
decreased? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They are just stable. It depends if my programs get mentioned in some
popular computer magazine, then they increase for a while. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you see the number of new macro viruses
increasing or decreasing over the coming months, to a year? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The number is actually exploding and we can expect to reach at least
1000 if not 2000 or more macro viruses at the end of 1997 (there are about
650 known ones at the moment). The reasons for this are simple: it`s too
easy to write a macro virus (just take a look at WINWORD.HLP) and Winword
itself creates new, slightly corrupted variants due to bugs in some critical
DLLs. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><B>-- Java </B></P>

<P>I think it`s just a nice toy for the computer industry so far. Net computers
will never become widespread when the software keep on growing this way
(ok, we all want to download some MBs of data every time we want to write
letters, don`t we?) and the telephone companies keep on charging high prices.
</P>

<P><B>-- ActiveX </B></P>

<P>Never heard about it. :) </P>

<P><B>-- Office 97? </B></P>

<P>Yet another virus platform the AV must care about. :( </P>

<P><B>-- Microsoft </B></P>

<P>Hrmph... They really should have learned some lessons about how to do
secure programs since the first version of MS-DOS, don`t they? :( </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">If you could change anything about the Anti-Virus
industry, what would it be? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><B>a)</B> That some companies stop claiming their program is detecting
100% of all viruses (&quot;past, present and future&quot;...). There is
no 100% detection or cleaning of viruses. Some if not most AV advertisement
is simply ridiciulous - that is what happens if some merchandizers make
advertisement for high-tech products they don`t understand at all. It`s
funny to see that the products with the least level of perfection and features
have the highest advertisement presence - and especially these companies
exagerate too much then. </P>

<P><B>b)</B> That some AV companies stop their childish press release wars
(and similar things). They really have better things to do. :( </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have any future plans? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Regarding my AV programs: Finishing F/WIN32 with a *real* macro heuristic
and VxD based virus scanning, adding VBA5.0 support etc. . About other
things, well, I don`t have much time to think about that. :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you feel the window into anti virus programming
is still open or has the ship left the dock already, its too steep a learning
curve for beginners? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Regarding how fast Microsoft invents new and even more complex virus
platforms I think it`s getting almost impossible to create a really useful
AV program nowadays with unique features. Even the deafest AV companies
noticed that some degree of generic virus detection (and cleaning) is useful
(alas, there are still some products that don`t have heuristics). </P>

<P>The number of viruses keeps on growing very fast (though the DOS virus
increase is slowing down), you really need a person which is busy just
sorting and managing the virus base. Then you need a DOS coder, a Windows
coder (better three or more because Windows coder tend to waste much time
playing Mine Sweeper and such things :) ), some experts to analyse new
viruses, new file formats and so on. And I think it`s difficult to find
really talented coders nowadays that care about the necessary low level
stuff. Visual programming has it`s disadvantages, sure... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many virus programmer have you allready
persuaded to stop their work. (don't say noone. ;)) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hehe. None. They currently stopped because they got bored writing viruses
or reading stupid interviews. ;) I actually cannot even persuade myself
to do some work, get up early etc, how should I be able to persude other
ones then? :) </P>

<P>Actually I sometimes have the impression that F/WIN has the opposing
effect - some ******* think it`s a good idea to write some anti-F/WIN virus
everytime I release a new version. :( </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">If the anti virus people went by handles, what
would you call yourself and why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I only use a handle on IRC, and I choosed it from some funny Robert
Asprin books I read a long time ago. The person with that name is exceptionally
lazy and dull, but he also has much luck. I think that describes me good
enough, doesn`t it? :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think it's possible to make the PERFECT
av program? I mean a av program that find/remove all present/past viruses.
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There is no perfect AV program. The day after you released it, some
virus writer will find a weak point in it and write an virus called &quot;AntiXYZ&quot;.
And the day after that the AV program get`s improved. This will never stop,
but maybe some day the operating systems get so complex that writing a
virus is impossible because the virus writer cannot afford to buy the necessary
information from the operating system company, but the AV companies still
can afford buying it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think is the best asm virus at
the moment? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I haven`t looked at ASM viruses for a while because they are all getting
so boring. How do you define &quot;best&quot;? Best polymorphic engine,
best stealth, most tricky infection method or best code &quot;design&quot;?
Usually, the DOS viruses that try to combine that all into their code are
very buggy and will never spread at all. And doesn`t it seems senseless
to write a very complex polymorphic engine when some AV programs will rip
it away within some days or even hours of improvements? Or write a very
unique infection method when there are very little files of the type the
virus can infect?</P>
