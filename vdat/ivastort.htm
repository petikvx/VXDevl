<P><font color="#004080"><b>How did you start out in computers? </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I got a Commodore c64 when I was 6 for Christmas (Yes I am that Old!!) I 
    was hooked from there on in , I learned to program in Basic then a little 
    asm on the Amiga before I got enough money to move up to PC's a few years 
    ago. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> About 1995 a shareware library i got stuff from started a small vx section 
    and to their credit had all the <a href="tutorial.htm#DA">Dark Angel Tutes</a> 
    and a few other things like <a href="creatrs2.htm#NRLG">NRLG</a> - I got everything 
    they had and bought a few books on asm.Usual progression after that shitty 
    com ow , appender etc etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Asm and VB. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Asm its not as intuitive as VB but its just sooooo versatile and there's 
    no better way of messing with M$ operating systems internals. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Nope. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have great respect for HMVS and F-Prot ..... as for the rest of them well 
    avp seems to be one of the more sensationalist vendors. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I dont think there is a war anymore - its more of a case of how much can 
    the AV vendors sensationalise virus writing in front of the media just to 
    shift more units,exactly as we are seeing with the "supposed" Y2K virus threat. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My namesake is a Bomb-Throwing Anarchist tortoise from an Underground Punk 
    magazine called Arnie as for why I ended up with it as a handle its a long 
    story. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Macro viruses are obviously going to be viewed as beneath asm viruses - 
    but I think theres a hell of a long way to go with macros especially as developers 
    keep adding Macro functionality to apps without any concept of security issues 
    and esp. when the Macro Functionality involves the VBA engine. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="ezines1.htm#VXT">VXtasy</a> is definately one of the best Zines 
    Ive seen. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Lord Julus for the above reason.As for Groups its gotta be the <a href="groups1.htm#CB">CodeBreakers</a>. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Jello Biafra.Both for his music (dk's rule) and for educating the sheep 
    ;o) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> All are - theyve created a multi-million dollar industry around them so 
    thats good isnt it ??? </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, 
  girlfriend etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yep , Hi Mum Hi dad :O) Theres a few people that know mostly friends (hi 
    peeps) there's wierder hobbies out there. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I think it is a very short-sighted ragime that would see viral research 
    made illegal There is a difference between creation and spreading - I cant 
    condone spreading but why should writing and research be illegal.....Thats 
    like banning computer security research because a small amount of the information 
    will get used malicously. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Just because people tell you something cant be done doesnt mean it is impossible.... 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Any other comments (take all the space you need)? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> As Jimi Hendrix once said "There'll be no smoking in the Gas chambers".
