<P> <b><font color="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I started kinda late, when I was 14 years old. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I already knew about viruses, but just when Paraguay connected to Internet 
    I got in contact with virus scene, that was approximately in august '96. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would you like 
  to take credit for? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, I wrote a lot of viruses. I'll take credit only for the published in 
    e-zines: Kuarahy, Literatura, Stratovarius, Fuxpro, Win32.Borges, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I use normally music and literature related names. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Quick Basic, Visual Basic, WordBasic, Assembler, Pascal, C++, Foxpro (dos&win), 
    Cobol, PERL, HTML and some other script languages. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What programming language do you like using the most? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembler! Nihil assembly maius. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are/were you a member of a VX group? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I was a member of International Knowledge eXchange, <a href="groups1.htm#IKX">IKX</a>. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most? Which 
  the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I hate all AVs. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Code viruses to learn, get friends and fun. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It gives more condiment to the activity ;) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Int 13h is the BIOS interrupt that gives disk IO services. I selected that 
    nickname because some viruses use it to kill HDs and also is the working INT 
    for boot sector viruses. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Elite to code. Lame to use. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly or 
  HLL viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Assembly viruses are the king, HLL the pawn. The remainder is silence. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Paraguay is in the wild, at least in Paraguay. Vecna told me that he found 
    one of my old viruses (Asterix) in his univ. Also, my first boot infector 
    is travelling across Paraguayan boot sectors and master boot records. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least?
