<P>Character presentation: </P>

<P>Pottie Rottie is 21 years old. He's studying computer-science at a university
that he wouldn't like to be mentioned. He's the writer of about 10 viruses
of varying quality. We decided to met at a university-phest (party), it
was a blast. The next morning, both having a huge hang-over we sat down
in front his computer and I showed him the basics of viruswriting. If he
had enough time, my best guess is that he could've been an alright viruswriter
since his mind is insane creative and somehow sick. Two good abilities
when it comes to writing perverted programs :-). </P>

<P>- The Unforgiven. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Give me a short description of who you are?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am Pottie Rottie :). I'm 21 years old and I'm currently taking some
classes on a university not doing too well since I have no real motivation
(or time over, perhaps?) to study. I like to drink tea, eat toasts and
suck on girl's titties (preferable on the same time, and on my gf's titties
:)). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">From where did you get you handle, Pottie Rottie?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I really hate thinking up handles since already nearly all good handles
are in use, it's not a trivial task to pick one anymore. I inserted the
tag Pottie Rottie into a virus for no specific reason and that's pretty
much about it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Does your handle has some specific meaning?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Read above :). No, it has definitly no meaning. It's actually so bad
so I don't expect anyone else to take it :). I really hate double-handles.
This Dark-this-and-Dark-that is getting a bit annoying if you ask me..
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you discover the world of computers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My father bought a C64 (great computer) early in the 80's and when he
bought his first PC (8088), I ripped the C64 from him and that's how it
all started. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How long have you been active in the scene?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am not really active in the scene :). I think I called the first BBS
in the middle of 1992 or so. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you came into the virus business? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I read a few virus oriented virus-magazine's and it seemed to be a cool
thing to do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you start to write viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To see if I could make it. To invent a new kinda weapon for blackmailing?
Hehe, probably because the media gave it so much attention I couldn't resist
the challenge. When I eventually recieved some source codes from you it
proved not to be as hard I thought it would be. The media really exaggarated
the difficulty. This mean that you don't have to be a genious for writing
a self-replicating program ;). I'm not saying that I'm stupid or something,
I just ain't no technical-minded-genious. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which goals do you have as a viruswriter? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Do improve my low-level programming as long as I live? Well, I don't
have any specific goals really, I mainly write viruses because I find it
a fun thing to do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming-languages are you familiar
with, and what's your favourite language? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am familiar with Pascal and assembler. My favourite language is of
course assembler because you really understand what's happening inside
the computer when you're coding in it. The same knowledge can never be
gained by programming in a high-level language. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many viruses has you written? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think I've written about 10 viruses or so, not all of them are though
released yet. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The first name which comes to my mind perhaps? Or something that sounds
cool or in one or another way draw some attention. I think I will name
my next virus from someone who really has influented me in real life. But
on the other side, viruses named after girls are getting a bit old :).
(Haha! This was personally ment as an attack against you TU!) [* Fuck off
asshole! - TU *] </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which one was the hardest to write? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A virus I havn't written yet. I have a very nice idea how a virus could
be very hard to detect and what I figured impossible to remove. I just
don't have enough time or knowledge to write it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you think a virus should be styled?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, new virus techniques is always a neat thing to do, if you can't
think of or implement any new virus-technique, try to make something unique
and creative, but simple. The two viruses you asked me for does both include
somehow original ideas. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You seem to critizise the religion a lot in
your viruses any specific reason for this? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yeah. I always have a reason when I do something. Religion is really
stupid. First of all god doesn't exist and how can you believe in something
that doesn't exist? Then, religion is the main reason to all wars (which
I believe you mentioned in IR#6) and wars are very stupid. If I believe
in something it's satan. That's a lot more logical to do. The society is
evil, and aren't god good? It's a paradox and it's because of this I think
very many viruswriters are influent by satan (We're quite a logical bunch
and believing in god is very unlogical so we don't). Look at <A HREF="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">Glenn
Benton</A> and Azrael's viruses, it's (what I think) real deep thoughts
behind them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What motivates you to write viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>As I said - it's basicly all about learning. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did some of them carried a destructive payload?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. I don't remember which but I am sure some of them did. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think you will continue to write viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If DOS continues to live on I will otherwise I probably won't. For the
moment I haven't got enough knowledge to write viruses for other operating
systems than DOS. If I get I will consider it. But I don't think DOS will
die before my interest does... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you feel guilty if one of your viruses
made damage to a hospital? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well if I personally had infect the hospital and some person got hurt
because of it I would but if it was a result of arrogance from their side
I wouldn't. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you deliberate infect a school or government
institution if you know they would replicate well if you did so? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yeah. Everything which can make a headline is worth doing and besides
infecting a school or governmental institution can't harm anyone. Not fysically
anyhow. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you find it easier to infect pirated software,
than PD/SW software? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I don't think so. There is no such thing as an innocent user. This
also mean that I don't discriminate :). But if you really want a virus
to spread, infect a pirated software, SW won't leave the country. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you encourage deliberate destructive code
in viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't encourage someone else to code destructive viruses but I do
it myself. It's all up to the writer how he'll design his viruses. Including
destructive code in a virus is is kinda dumb since it will waste more bytes
and on the same time reduce the chanse for the virus to spread. Kinda contradictory
consider a virus goal is to replicate without being detected. An undestructive
virus has a greater chanse to survive, but on the other hand it sometimes
feels like the right thing to code them destructive. I have a splitted
opinions about the issue concerning destructive code inside viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What to you think of the issue concerning 'undestructive-viruses'?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it is real hard to write a undestructive virus due to all compatibility
problems. Even if you make a 100% compatible virus today it might not be
compatible tommorow. New executable's, new inviroments, new versions of
the specific OS (a lot of virus code is undocumented), won't make it easier
ya'know. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think one can make a virus benefictial?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have no idea really how to make one but in theory of course you can
make one benefictial. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever considered writing a GOOD virus?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I havn't. It's too hard, and noone would use it anyway since the
media really has scared most users for viruses.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Gonthev described in his 'write-up' &quot;<A HREF="eparegoo.htm">Is
good Computer-Viruses still a bad idea</A>&quot;, do you think one of those
viruses can be classified good? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I haven't tried any of the viruses described, but I doubt they are good
for everyone. It's hard (if not impossible) to control the spread of computer
viruses. Some who don't want the virus might get it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have any more argument why viruses can't
be benefictial than lack of control, recognition difficulty, resource wastening,
bug containment, compatibility problems, effectiveness, unauthorized data-modifications,
copyright violations, possible misuse, responsibility, and trust problems?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmm.. So hard to code that noone's tries? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">If you think its possible to write a good virus,
how to solve the above problems? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You can't solve all problems above. It's an impossible task. Some person
might think they've solved all problems but that's just in his opinion
and not everyone's opinions. Opinions can really vary. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">About <A HREF="creators.htm">virus-code-generators</A>,
what is your opinion about them, and about people using them thinking they
are hot-shot-elite? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I laugh at them. Those dorks can't code for shits. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you write viruses to get recognition in
the virus/AV community? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No I don't :). I mainly do it for the pure pleasure of it. But a few
articles in some big magazine would though be nice. It would be a neat
thing to hack a big newspaper and write your own articles and then send
them away and make sure they get published. But since my ego is great already
I don't need that kind of self-congratulation :-). But on the other hand
it would be a great hack, wouldn't it? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the media/AV describing
viruswriters as lonely individuals with no life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I laugh at them because they barely have talked with any viruswriter,
and can of course not tell how we're in a private matter. But people in
today's society is often lonely so to some extend, they're correct. This
is probably the fault of people's belief in materialism and addiction to
fysical things. Did that sound cryptic? Well, consider living 100 years
ago, back then you're dependent on other people doing things for you but
nowadays you manage living on your own.... This of course has a price too,
and among many things, loneliness is one. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think the scene is associal or not?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The scene can be both social and associal. The scene is what you makes
it to. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How are you in real life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I can't really describe myself since I am totally scitzo! :). Hmm, well
guess I'm just a orinary guy with an interest in computers and the technical
side of computing. I'm very involved in the student life. I have my own
'talk-show' on the student radio and I am also the editor of our student-magazine.
Furthermore I organize student- parties and I'm also working as a disc-jockey
sometimes. I like messing and screwing things around into a total chaos,
but I do however somehow manage to spend some quality time togheter with
my girlfriend and seeing 'normal' (IRL) friends. Occasionally I also study
:-). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you make your living? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am studying and get money from our dear government. Sometime I work
as well but as long as I can afford to live I don't. This also mean that
I don't have any money on any bank and so forth :). When I get money -
I spend 'em. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have the scene/viruswriting influent you in
real life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think it has influent me very much, if it has I am happily unaware
of it :). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do your parents/close friends thinks about
your viruswriting? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My parents don't know about it and if you knew me in a more private
matter than you do you wouldn't have asked this question since then you
would also know that I broke contact with them about 2 years ago. They
wouldn't respect my new girlfriend being from another country, not speaking
perfect swedish and if she wasn't good enough for them, well I just said
fuck-off and didn't call home anymore. Eventually, they tried to accept
her, but still they're very rude to her peaking on her's choice of words,
correcting her grammer and we kinda splitted with them again. When they
apologize, I might consider forgiving them, but honestly I don't know if
I ever do since I have a hard time respecting racists. </P>

<P>Some of my close friends knows about my interest in viruses since I'm
always the guy to help them out when they get a virus. They don't understand
why I'm writing them, but they won't really care either. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you into viruswriting only or other parts
of the computer-underground? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hacking? Well, its just a matter of definition I think. I do some hacking
but nothing serious. I haven't considered phreaking because I seldom call
out anyhow. I am not involved in any carding activity because it's very
easy to get caught and the laws are also very specific and hard on phraud
of that kind. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What in the scene do you find okay to do, and
what don't you do bcos you find it morally wrong? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think much is wrong. It all depends on the situation you're
in and not what you're doing. Killing can sometime be okay. I know this
sounds weird to some, but are really persons like Saddam Hussain worth
living? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What parts of the underground do you think
needs improvements? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The attitude part. It seems like people like flaming too much. I hate
it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Positive/negative aspects of the scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Negative: The attitude some people has.<BR>
Positive : The great flow of knowledge and information in general. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What's your opinion about the swedish scene?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The virus-scene has grown bigtime since TWL/HNS started. Before the
opening of this board the swedish virusscene was non-existence. Nowadays
a lot of viruses are being produced in Sweden. Look at TaiPan, Junkie,
Desperado and Scitzo - they were all reported everywhere. More and more
viruswriter's are popping up and more and more viruses are released from
here. It's a great development. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Whats your opinion about polymorphic engines?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They're cool programs. Really hard to make them totally polymorphic
and on the same time make them stable enough. I hate buggy code. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why do you think people won't use them? (other
than the inventors?) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>People want to write their own code rather than borrow other people's.
Writing an engine takes much time and knowledge. Most people don't have
either of them. Not even the inventors use their own engines very much
it seems. Once they've written the engine the challenge is taken and they
see no point in including it in a lot of viruses. It might also have something
to do with the AVers.. Once the engine is made public (released in a virus,
for example), its only a matter of (short) time before it's scannable.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the new computer-laws
propositions concerning viruses and such things? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It sucks. Do I really need to comment this? Viruswriting should never
be considered as a crime, maybe spreading should? I don't agree you on
this 'fuck-laws' things because I have no belief in people's moral and
think anarchy isn't the way to go. I am though very liberate to most 'youth-things'
(drugs, sex, alcohol, smoke, cloth), and well this also mean that I do
respect other people and consider myself open-minded. Maybe because of
my keen interest in other people, attitude's, belief's and all that which
makes people different? To name a few examples as 'proof', my girlfriend
is from Bosnia (meaning: I am unprejudicted) and one of my friends is a
drug-addict and homosexual. I dress like a 14-year old attitude-kid, but
that's not my problem. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think it's unethical to program viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Personally I don't think so, but I know a lot who does. Its pretty much
the same question about producing weapons. Whos responsiblity is it that
people get harmed with a gun? The one who designed/manu- factured it or
the one who used it? Of course it's the one who used it. Go and ask this
question to a judge and you'll get my point. . . </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Whats your opinion about the EU? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have no opinion about the EU. It's way too early to understand the
effects of our membership in it as for now. Haven't noticed any changes
at all really. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Whats your opinion about the swedish government?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have no opinion really since I have no interest in politics at all.
I guess they're ordinary humans. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have any spreaders to get around your
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. When I finish a virus, I might release it into the wild myself,
the less people involved - the less risc to get busted. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which virus programmer do you admire/like?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There are a few I really look up to but admire? Hmm.. I don't know really.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No idea :). Hmm.. A virus which is 100% compatible between all operating
systems and never gets detected? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect viruscoder: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A person who dedicates 24 hours/day for writing viruses or the person
who write's the perfect virus described above :). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the AV-community: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Mainly they're a bunch of geeks but some are different. I would really
like to see viruses written by respected anti-virus programmers, like Frans
Veldman. Those viruses would kick major butt. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV-program do you think is the best?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like Tbscan a lot, but it has yet to solve all false-positives. F-Prot
is alright too since it gives nearly no false-positives and they're updating
their product very often. AVP has a nice demo- section which just might
inspire viruswriters to make fancy payloads. Else I don't know really but
if you're paranoid about viruses, just install an integrity-checker which
is more reliable than any scanning software. The utils from TBAV is good
but I shouldn't be using them anyways because viruswriters seem to love
attacking Frans and his utilities :-). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think an AV-program can guarantee 100%
detection rate for all known &amp; unknown viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. There is always a way to code around a specific anti-virus program.
Even if the virus grow in size/complexity there will always be a way to
do it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you know/heard of any new technics coming
in the near future? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not really. But viruses written in protected mode could be quite a cool
thing to do, I think this will be done shortly. If we look at the future
in a wider perspective I think self-learning viruses is the next logical
step. This is fully doable with today's knowledge about A.I. Else, I think
viruswriter will aim for other and newer operating-system with the same
techniques as we see today (stealth/polymorphism, etc. etc. ). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Bontchev wrote an article &quot;Future trends
in viruswriting&quot;, how viruses in the nearest future could look like,
how to you think that will influent today's viruswriters? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think all Bontchev's articles makes a good read. Some of his ideas
is really hard to code but we might see one of his ideas in a virus, sometime..
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What to you think about the future for DOS
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know really. Trends changes on daily basis in the computer industry.
. . I can't really tell. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think viruses will be written for other
(newer) operation- systems like OS/2 and Win95? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. Sometime someone will start to code for them and when he (or she
;)) share his information more will begin.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think its possible to write a virus
for Win95? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Of course it's possible. Everything is possible. It just takes a lot
more effort. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think viruses then still will be programmed
in low-level assembly kinda language or high-level languages like C or
Pascal? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think assembly is the natural choice to write viruses in, and I doubt
people will start to use C/C++ for win95/NT, OS/2-Warp, etc. However, I
would really like to see how viruses for UNIX could be written. The problem
when writing a virus for UNIX is automatically to get full access so you
can modify the files. Maybe UNIX viruses will be written in C because C
is the natural choice when coding for UNIX. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any advice to people who want's to learn the
basic of virus-writing? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Read some theory of how it can be done and then start to write one with
your own ideas from scratch without looking on other people's code. After
you've done your first virus it can be wise to look at other people's solutions,
and learn from them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think the virus-problem will decrease
due to laws? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think so. Maybe a little? If the subject get a lot of attention
(again), it will only start '92 all over. Then the problem will increase
instead of slow down :). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Can you be reached somewhere? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, since I'm not a very scene-involved kinda guy, it's better they
contact you first and if you find them trustworthy and so on, just give
them my phone-number </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your mottoe is: </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Do whatever get's you trough the day&quot; Or: &quot;Flee from
the reality instead of face it&quot; is the mottoe of a friend but I won't
ripp him off since I don't agree him. I don't think I have a specific mottoe
but just fucking do what feels good and don't ever fear the consequence.
Maybe I will ripp of Nike's advertising saying &quot;Just do it!&quot;
because that's how things happends. For example, I have a cute little ending-story
here :-). My girlfriend was going to be 20 years old (at that time I didn't
know her) and I hadn't bought her a present since I didn't know her. And
when she opened the door I said &quot;Well, I have no present for you,
but since I want to give the greatest present to you, you can have me&quot;
since she looked incredible good and a friend told me she was nice as well,
I &quot;Just did it&quot;, and after the night we was a couple and have
been happily together ever since (2+ years ago). </P>

<P>No, I always tend to say what I want to say and if I don't I won't tell
it here :). Hmm.. but to please you, okay! &quot;Tea toast and (titanic)
titties forever and ever. . . . &quot;, and well I have not yet figured
out the reason why this interview was made but if some of your readers
does (or even enjoyed it (please, spare me the psychological analyze!)),
feel free to contact me.. !, and yeah, sorry about all english mistakes,
if some of your reader have any trouble with it send complaints to The
Unforgiven :-), hahaha! Will you print that? [* Yes I will, happy now?
