<P>Which are the most common viruses? We've answered this question several
times. Each time, we have produced slightly different answers because the
specific numbers reported depend on how precisely the virus is defined
in the survey, the actual rates of infection in the locality surveyed,
and the reporting rate. (It is likely that Michelangelo infections have
been reported at higher rates relative to their incidence frequency than
has Jerusalem.Standard). Our current answer is a result of compiling information
from several sources: market research, our own tallies, and tallies from
virus researchers around the world. </P>

<P>The table below lists and describes the 10 most common viruses. </P>

<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Virus Name</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Comment</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Cascade.1701</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified merely as Cascade, this
1987 Swiss virus may cause the text on your CGA screen to fall to the bottom
line. The original caused this cascading effect in October, November, or
December of 1988 only variations may not display the effect at all. This
family adds 1701 bytes to COM files, not infecting EXE files. The virus
is encrypted beyond the first 35 bytes. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Cascade.1704</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified merely as Cascade, from
which it was derived. Adds 1704 bytes to files, may cause random reboots,
and won't drop any letters from your screen. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Dark Avenger.1</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified merely as Dark Avenger.
Written by a Bulgarian who calls himself Dark Avenger and called this,
his (and Bulgaria's) first virus Eddie version 1.0&quot;. Written in September,
1988, it adds 1800 bytes to COM and EXE files. Contains no text, does no
damage, infects well. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Dark Avenger.4</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as Dark Avenger, Eddie
II, V2100, and 2100. This variant is 2100 bytes. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Frodo</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as 4096 or 4K (for the
number of bytes it adds), 100 years (because it marks files as infected
by adding 100 years to the file's date stamp, Frodo (because it tries to
place a boot sector birthday message to Frodo in the fall) or Stealth (because
once in memory, its size increase does not show with the DIR command.)
Infects COM and EXE files rapidly, including COMMAND.COM, and infects on
file open, so if it isn't detected by your scanner when it is in memory,
it will infect every file your scanner opens to check. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Green Caterpillar.1</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as 1575 and/or 1591,
this virus is spreading rapidly, despite the fact that it lets DOS place
the date/time on the file showing when it became infected. Infects COM
and EXE files, adding 1575 bytes (or so). Infects when a DIR or COPY command
is executed, rather than when files are executed. Likely to make your screen
lurch when you give a DIR command, as it pauses to infect something. May
display a green caterpillar. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Jerusalem.Standard</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as Jerusalem or Jerusalem-B,
this October 1987 virus infects COM and EXE files, adding 1813 bytes to
the size of COM files and re-infecting EXE files. Memory resident, it infects
files as they are run. The original deleted the file you were executing
on Friday 13th, but numerous variants now perform this miracle on a variety
of date conditions. One half hour after going memory resident, the original
scrolls up a bit of your screen, revealing a black hole, one of its synonyms.
</TD>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Michelangelo</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Recent star of stage and screen, Michelangelo
is derived from Stoned.Standard. Infecting only 5.25&quot; disks in drive
A: and the Master Boot Record of C:, it does nothing but spread well until
March 6. On March 6, booting with this boot virus will give it a chance
to overwrite your entire boot drive, starting from the outside tracks.
Predictions of 5 million infections were untrue. This virus appeared in
June, 1991, barely makes our Top Ten chart, and is very rare. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Stoned.Standard</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as Stoned, this was
written by a 16 year old in New Zealand in 1988, rapidly spreading worldwide.
The original only infected 360K disks in drive A: and the Master Boot Record
of C:. Intended to cause no damage, it overwrites a sector of the FAT on
hard disks lacking slack space, and variants willingly cause damage to
root or FAT on 3.5&quot; floppies. The original displayed the message Your
PC is now Stoned! in one of 8 or so boots from an infected floppy. The
boot sector will contain the non-displaying message Legalise Marijuana!
in the original. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="182" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Yankee Doodle 2885</TD>

<TD width="546" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Often identified as TP44VIR, this is
the 44th version of a virus series written by a Bulgarian author with the
initials T.P. in September, 1989. It plays Yankee Doodle at 5PM, but causes
no damage. </TD>
