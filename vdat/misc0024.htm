<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Features:</b> CollectionMaker uses so-called report files (or logfiles), 
    which are generated by some antiviruses during their run. Those report file 
    includes (except other information) information about files on your disk which 
    are infected by virus. Using this information CollectionMaker is bale to sort 
    your virus collection in handy way. CollectionMaker can create directories 
    with names derived from virus names (they can be extracted from such a logfile) 
    and copies coresponded files there. (e.g. virus A will be in directory A). 
    Afterwards, it is much easier to navigate in such a sorted collection. If 
    you are looking for, for example macrovirus WM97M/Melissa.A, just enter to 
    directory named W97M/Melissa.A...</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Features: </b>TBweeder (Frans Veldman) is an &quot;in
    house&quot; sorter for ThunderByte Anti-Virus.</p>
    <p>TbWeeder is a utility to weed out duplicate files.</p>
    <p>Virus researchers often receive large virus collections
    which contain many duplicate files. Not all anti-virus
    vendors use the same virus naming convention, and often a
    virus sample is renamed to match to the name printed by the
    scanner used to identify the virus. These renamed files are
    copied into other collections, causing many renamed but equal
    files floating around in all kind of virus collections. </p>
    <p>TbWeeder can help to identify duplicate files, and
    automatically delete them.</p>
    <p>Duplicate files are files with the same 32-bit CRC and
    length. To be absolutely sure, TbWeeder will perform a full
    match - byte by byte - of the files if both files are
    available.</p>
    <p>TbWeeder can also maintain a database so it is not
    necessary to rescan all files over and over again to search
    for duplicates. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Features:</b> VGrep is an attempt to provide a solution
    to a problem which vexes anyone who takes technical support
    calls in the anti-virus industry. In spite of the best
    efforts of CARO, there are very little signs of convergence
    in virus naming 'conventions'. By it's very nature, it is an
    ugly problem.<br>
    <br>
    What VGrep does is attempt to provide a system to
    cross-reference this myriad of names. The logic is that if I
    run X scanner products across our virus collection, I will be
    able to combine the log files generated by the products (the
    primary key being the filename, of course) into a table. The
    reality, of course, is nothing like as easy as this, and this
    work requires a fair amount of processing power.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Features:</b> A virus collector's tool allowing a virus
    collector to keep a clean collection of viruses that have
    been sorted out into uniq infections based upon standard
    Anti-Viral scanner log files. Virsort is also a tool which
    allows virus traders to trade viruses between each other,
    only sending the scannable viruses that each other do not yet
    have. VIRSORT (for Win95) can create sorted subdirs (and
    files) that are in the DOS 8.3 file-name convention, or
    create dirs and filenames in the LongFileName (LFN) format.
    VIRSORT will NOT overwrite files like it did in the past.
    When a filename exists that is IDENTICAL to the filename in
    the database (in 8.3 mode) an error message is created and
    placed into a file called OVRWRITE.LOG. This file is ONLY
    created if the sort is in 8.3 mode, and if the name of the
    database used is VIRSORT.DAT. </p>

    <p><b>Features: </b>LWM will allow you to safely examine the
    macros present in Word version 6 and templates without the
    need to load the file into Word and possibly activate a virus
    or trojan that could delete files, format the drive or
    install a virus of your system. Since LWM does not use Word
    (or Windows!) to read the file, there is no chance that any
    malicious macros can do anything to your system. Just run LWM
    with the name of the Word template and it will write out a
    new file with the extension 'mac' containing all the macros
    listed much like they would be listed in Word (see program
    notes below for some exceptions). </p>

  <p><b>Features: </b>"RenExts" was written to rename files back to their original 
    extensions. It does this by checking the contents of the file and matching 
    those contents to known formats. It is HIGHLY accurate. I use this program 
    EXCLUSIVELY on my (Phage's [CCTX]) collection. The program scans all the files 
    in the current subdirectories and recurses into any other directories. As 
    it goes it writes output to the screen, to a file called "BadList.Lst" and 
    to a batch file named "RenF.Bat". The theory is this: run the program in the 
    directory that you want checked. Look at the "badlist.lst", if you agree with 
    the results run "RenB.Bat". If you do NOT agree with the results, send me 
    a copy of the files and why you disagree.</p>
