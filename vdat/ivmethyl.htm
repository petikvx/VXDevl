<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started off with BBC MICROs in my primary school (which were BASIC
only machines). I also had a friend of the time which ran an Amstrad with
BASIC and CP/M. I read the manuals from both computers and learnt BASIC
(though we didn't have CP/M manuals at that time).<BR>
Soon after, I made a friend who gave me an IBM XT with a 40meg MFM hard
disk and a monochrome monitor. A year later, he gave me an IBM AT with
40meg hard disk and EGA. Soon after I got a 386SX-16 with 4 megs of ram.
Then I aquired a 200meg hard disk (which died after a few years of loyal
use) and a SVGA screen. Recently I bought a 486DX2-66 with 400meg hard
disk and 16 megs of RAM. This should do me for at least another year. You
could say quite confidently that I've been through the whole progression
of personal computer technology ;) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it started when I recieved some DOS 5 install disks and they
kept complaining about some errors in unpacking files during installation.
After running an AV (probably McAfee) I learnt I had a virus (which was
pretty neat at the time).<BR>
Then I read about viruses in Ralf Burger's book (I forget the title) and
bought a book by McAfee on &quot;Computer Viruses Data Diddlers Trojan
Horses, and other threats to your system&quot;. It sucked but oh well.<BR>
Then someone gave me a copy of Stoned, then I built up a collection, then
I learnt assembly language (beforehand I knew C++, which I'd written a
few trojans in, hehehe). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Of course I've written viruses. Unfortunately none so far have been
very unique. Actually I've only written a few viruses with most of my other
time writing documentation on virus technology. </P>

<P>One thing I do want be known for is Facade, and a new virus which I'm
in the process of writing called Essence. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They're usually named according to what is stressing me at the time
in real life, or alternetively, according to what is special about the
virus. Here is a short list: </P>

<P><B>Girl In Green: </B></P>

<P>At this time I had a crush on a girl who I saw on the bus home from
school, who always wore a green school uniform. I spoke to her once in
a shopping center for like 2 seconds while she looked me up and down (I
was dressed somewhat strangely). As a matter of fact I think I saw her
just a few days ago at a bus stop (of course, not in uniform). </P>

<P><B>Toilet Bowl: </B></P>

<P>Hehehe, this got its name from the payload it used which was when it
detected it was being traced by TBCLEAN (with prefetch tricks) it'd jump
into the video segment and start executing code. I thought this was like
flushing TBCLEAN down the toilet :) </P>

<P><B>Facade: </B></P>

<P>This was written for a friend who wanted it to say 'Facade' in the payload.
</P>

<P><B>Lauren and Lauren Obsession: </B></P>

<P>I was obsessed with a girl called Lauren in america who has in the last
year dissapeared :( I can't get into contact with her. </P>

<P><B>Black Tide: </B></P>

<P>A friend of a friend had died from a crack overdose and I was upset.
I walked down to the beach at midnight and wrote a poem about it called
the black tide. </P>

<P><B>Fractured Reality: </B></P>

<P>This was a new version of Black Tide I think... it didn't include the
poem but it included a little short text which blaspheme'd against God
for taking away my friend's friend (who, quite strangely, might not have
ever existed at all! it's a long story). </P>

<P><B>Essence: </B></P>

<P>This is the latest virus I'm writing. It uses a new form of polymorphism,
the technology of which is based upon the very factors which evolved life
from nothingness. The very essence of life itself is used in the polymorphism,
hence the name. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>At one time or another I've been fluent in Turbo Pascal, C, C++, Visual
Basic (1), and assembly language. These days however, I don't remember
a word of VB, Pascal I'd need a refresher course on, C/C++ I'm relearning
right now, and I know assembly language pretty well at the moment and am
trying to grasp protected mode basics. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have to say now that I -HATE- all BASIC and languages derived from
BASIC. It just has no structure. </P>

<P>Pascal sucks because nobody uses it anymore, and access of files in
it sucks from what I remember. </P>

<P>C/C++ is very good though. I love the structure. </P>

<P>Assembly Language is very good too! </P>

<P>I'm thinking of learning ADA95, it sounds good, but I guess I don't
really know anything about it, so it's best I don't comment (yet) :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I used to be a member of [<A HREF="groups1.htm#IRG">Immortal Riot/Genesis</A>]
but I have since left and am starting my own group. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I really dislike all AV software. I mean, companies are spending more
time on interfaces than the actual methods of virus detection under the
hood. </P>

<P>For instance, TBAV's heuristics started good but are now just really
slack. DSAV can miss a virus strain because it uses CRC-32 and any change
of even one byte will make it miss the virus completely. FPROT is really
just an okay all round virus scanner but doesn't have that good heuristics
and names alot of viruses as variants when they're not. </P>

<P>Some other pathetic packages worth mentioning are McAfee, Virus Buster
and VET (two packages native to here in Australia). They suck real bad.
NAV and PC-CILLAN are supposed to be really bad too. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'd say world domination but that's too cliche. Actually more than anything
I want my group to be known, I want governments and military to label us
terrorists and fear us :) </P>

<P>On a more personal level, I want to become better at writing viruses,
I want to develop some new technology to make viruses better. I want to
be part of writing the virus which changes the world. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I hate the AV with a passion. I mean, not on a personal level, but just
on a business level where they produce crappy products and slap it in a
nice user interface and spoon feed the users garbage about 'new virus detection
methods inside!' which are just bullshit. </P>

<P>Then again, who can blame them, a majority of computer users are braindead
idiots, as far as using a computer goes that is. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Methyl is short for 'The Methyl Lated Spyryt'. Before that I was throwing
around a few handles, looking for one which suited me. I was being called
'Casper the unfriendly ghost' at the time by some friends who knew what
I was up to... and I enjoyed being a ghost. But then I saw a bottle of
methyl-lated spirits on the shelf of a toilet and thought &quot;Hey, why
don't I call myself The Methyl Lated Spirit??&quot;. A few years later
it evolved to 'Spyryt' instead of &quot;Spirit&quot;. </P>

<P>Unfortunately people think of Methyl as in various chemical substances,
especially alcohol, and being associated with that really pisses me off.
This is why I'm chosing a new handle (also to coincide with the creation
of my new group), it seems likely at the moment to be 'IndianOwl'. </P>

<P>The reason for that is because I love owls (yes, whoot whoot, the ones
which fly). They are the most elegant and beautifull creature :) I also
love how spiritual the red indians were... they really were cool. I am
a deeply spiritual person (in a general sense) and I love owls, so why
not be a red indian owl? :P You could say, i'm a red indian owl spyryt...
RIOS :) </P>

<P>No handle is definately decided upon yet. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I never really worked out how to use <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</A>,
but the idea of a GUI was nice, it could have been implemented much better
however. </P>

<P><A HREF="creatrs2.htm#PSMPC">PS-MPC</A> and <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#G2">G2</A>
however were very good, I like them. I generated alot of code to look over
when I was trying to understand how a virus can go TSR. <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#BW">BW</A>
(Biological Warfare) was quite good too, sort of. I liked the colours :)
</P>

<P>Most new viruses generators suck compared to these old two. I personally
like VCKs. I see it as a challenge to write a good one, and in the end
they might help somebody, and cause lots of glut for the AV. Hey, it's
a VCK, it creates viruses, what's so bad about that? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HLL viruses I don't like too much, especially ones which use more assembly
than the high level routines. I guess this is just a result of my virus
upbringing, and has no real reason to it :) </P>

<P>Macro viruses however, hehe, it's funny to see how many assembly language
coders disrespect macro VWs (I even used to!). But look, macro viruses
really are spreading well in the wild, moreso than the new assembly language
viruses are.<BR>
On the other hand, I hate any form of BASIC and WordBasic is the main macro
virus language. Also, just the idea of macro's is sort of limiting, but
with DLL calls etc that's not so true anymore. </P>

<P>I don't especially like macros or HLL viruses but if they get the job
done, who am I to complain? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yup, Facade was in the wild. I never spread it, I just gave the source
to 2 people and told them not to hand it out. Then after a few months I
decided to release the source to anyone that asked.... and then ShadSeek
came to me and told me he'd gotten paid to remove my virus from some university
over in the United States. He said he'd never seen the virus of anyone
he knows in the wild before :) </P>

<P>Personally he should have waited... in a few months the payload would
have destroyed all the infected hard disks :) Facade was my first destructive,
and so far only destructive, virus. Girl In Green did corrupt the floppy
disk boot sector on activation but this was by a coding error. </P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like nor hate these people, they make money, that's what they
do. If they can sleep at night, knowing that they are ripping off computer
users with marketing tricks, then that's fine with me. The less protected
people are the easier for my group to do what we need to do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My Brother: </P>

<UL>
<P>He won australian craftsman of the year award, he's the most artistic
person I know and does some cool indian and framing stuff.</P>
</UL>

<P>Hitler: </P>

<UL>
<P>I hate this person for what he did, but he achieved lots in his lifetime.
He rose from being nothing to nearly taking over the whole of Europe, and
I can't help but respect that.</P>
</UL>

<P>I respect very few other people, namely because in general, people suck
bigtime. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have strong views that destructive viruses with a long period before
activation, spread better than others. </P>

<P>For example, imagine a virus on a users hard disk. It replicates quickly
into all of his files. That user, will over time, is likely to swap whatever
files and other infectable objects with their friends over a certain period
of time, say 3 months. After that time, they will rarely interact with
other people. </P>

<P>So after 3 months, your virus is likely to get noticed by that person
as they install new AV software, or notice strange things happening with
their computer. If you destroy their computer, they won't have time to
discover your virus, and meanwhile your virus is spreading through all
the other people that person knew. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Good is a relative term :P I think viruses are very usefull where other
software would fail. For instance, targetting a high security place so
you can gain access through backdoors installed by the virus, or even just
causing mass computer chaos. That stuff is not so easy with 'freeware'
or trojan horse software ;) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Computer viruses really are my life. At the moment I'm taking a college
course on electronic engineering, but I might switch over to a programming
class soon. Both interest me, but are only there so I can get a job and
stay alive while I code viruses. One day I wouldn't mind working for the
government in espionage or maybe writing an AV for them :) It's always
best... to work from the inside out, hehe. Gain their trust then take the
bastards down! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I've never had a girlfriend :P My parents and family don't know shit
about computers though so that's useless. I gave a 15 minute speech to
my whole electronics engineering class on basic encryption/polymorphism
methods, and what viruses are etc... so I think they might all be onto
me ;) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not really. I mean we all pirate stuff when we need to, but I don't
sit around hording warez CD's or anything. </P>

<P>I also just installed linux and am relearning C/C++ so maybe I can learn
a little about hacking, although it's not so much important as boycotting
Win95. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't really care. The only thing that will ever stop me writing viruses
is me, not any crappy law. </P>

<P>As for spreading, well if anyone spreads my viruses and I get blamed
for it when I don't even know the person spreading it... the person who's
blaming me can go straight to hell. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I can't, there's no such thing :P </P>

<P>Of course, I do have views on BETTER viruses. I think that viruses can
become MUCH better at polymorphism, and also MUCH better at living in the
wild. </P>

<P>The thing is, you see, that people aren't really writing viable for
the viruses anymore, and they don't know how to :P They all have the wrong
impression of what a viable virus is. </P>

<P>For instance, not using just one or two routines to infect files, or
go resident, or tunnel.. but rather using a whole list of routines and
selecting among them. This is the idea behind a new coding style which
I'm writing a document on, I call it 'Smart Virus Technology' but it'll
probably change, since like I said, it's more a way of coding than code.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I hate it. It's too big, it's too slow, and it demands hardware which
is far from my reach. Even on the best systems it leaves too many temporary
files laying around the hard disk. Also, it's important to me how much
an operating system is hiding from me. Linux doesn't hide anything, DOS
hides a little but not much, and Win95 hides everything. 'Hiding' makes
it harder to fix problems and create new software. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Don't lose faith, computer viruses are still viable for the wild if
you code correctly. Also, back up your hard disk, you'll lose it many times
while you're testing your viruses :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Absolutely, I'm usually 'Methyl' on IRC undernet (go to the server us.undernet.org)
on #VIRUS. Lately I'm trying the nick/handle 'IndianOwl' on too so you
might find me under that. At the very worst go into #VIRUS and ask around.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sure! Hi everyone! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any other comments? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The AV need to give me a challenge. Meanwhile, the rest of you virus
writers need to lift your game and get off your asses and start coding
viable infectors again. </P>

<P>Also here's a list of document's I've written/am writing: </P>

<P><B>Tunneling Document Series</B></P>

<P>: This was a series of 4 documents, it teaches you everything about
tunneling that there is to know. It has everything for people from the
very beginner to the most advanced. </P>

<P><B>Tunneling Grimoire</B></P>

<P>: This is under development, it's a complete rewrite of the above series
into one giant document. Lots of new information, lots of old confusing
stuff removed, better example software, etc. Definately look out for it
but it might not be out for quite a while. </P>

<P><B>Mid-File Infection Series</B></P>

<P>: I started this series on the 2 main ways of mid file infection but
scrapped the project because <A HREF="ivsandmn.htm">MrSandman</A> said
that he was releasing a complete document on it in the near future. If
he doesn't put his in 29A#2 I'll release mine. </P>

<P><B>Life Support for Viruses</B></P>

<P>: This is about a new method of coding that keeps your viruses in the
wild for longer. It's still being written. </P>

<P><B>RHM Evolving Polymorphism:</B></P>

<P>: 2 beta's have been released on this, it may eventually be included
in the 'LSV' document above. </P>

<P><B>Virus Techniques</B></P>

<P>: This was a document on the current virus technologies available, and
the pros and cons of using them. It was released as a beta, I probably
won't update it, or it might be put into my 'LSV' document. </P>

<P><B>Computer Viruses - Artificial Life?</B></P>

<P>: This is in development, you DEFINATELY should read this if you're
interested in computer viruses at all. It is the best philisophical read
ever :P </P>

have been better if Genesis stayed on its lonesome (not that IR is bad
or anything). </P>

<UL>
<P>Well, we weren't really organized at all. At least not me, I only know
the emails of a few of the members, and it seemed to me that nobody was
really doing anything. I asked for some help in releasing another magazine
but nobody really cared. </P>

<P>I think that part of the group died when Sepultura left, he really was
the brains and the momentum behind the magazine #8 and it would never have
been possible without him. </P>

<UL>
<P>Really, there is none as far as I know :P On my side of Australia I
only know of one other virus coder, and he is now retired (and dissapeared!).
On the other side of Australia you HAD Sepultura and Qark (both retired),
and <A HREF="misc0006.htm">Harry McBungus (dead)</A>. The only living people
there who still code (as far as I know) are QuantumG and DV8. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you ever consider releasing a virus creator?

<UL>
<P>Yup, I was thinking of working on one a few days ago. </P>

<UL>
<P>IRG plans on sitting back and waiting for someone else to release IRG#9
hehehehe. I myself am working on all my documents listed above, and getting
my team together. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will IRG increase the number of members? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know, until they show some activity I don't think anyone would
want to join :) </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you leave IRG? What were they like?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>IRG was, and still is, a team of really excellent people. I mean seriously,
I love half the people in that group :) Unfortunately, not many that I
knew of were really coding, or if they were, were not interesting in helping
me release a magazine. </P>

<P>I realized that an inactive group was not for me and for me to realise
my full potential, and to bring it out in other people, a new, fresh and
exciting group was needed... a group of my own. </P>

<P>I just hope you don't think I don't like IRG or don't appreciate once
being part of the group. By all means, the people are great and I really
did enjoy being part of IRG. Just because I didn't see anything happening
doesn't mean that something wasn't happening behind the scenes, after all
I didn't know all the members. And just because they aren't active now
doesn't mean that they aren't going to burst into a burning productive
fury any minute :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">New group?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Above, I was asked much about my old group, I thought it only convenient
to let your readers know about what I hope my new group will turn out to
be. Of course, things will change as new members join and voice their opinion.
</P>

<P>This group, is not like your ordinary group. We will be a worldwide
network of virus writers (and possibly people of other specialities) who
communicate regularly. We will be democratic in nature. There is of course
a heirachy, but rather than concentrating on the level of ability in a
person, it will concentrate on what skills they have with which they can
contribute to the group. </P>

<P>We will be labelled by the governments as terrorists, and by people
as freedom fighters. We will interact with violence, wherever we as a group
feel that people or information are being suppressed, even if this means
releasing some of the worlds most virulent and dangerous viruses into the
wild, for which there is no protection. </P>

<P>We will research cutting edge technology, and use what we learn to create
such viruses, the virulence of which never seen before. We will use computer
viruses to their full potential, and should they fail to achieve their
designated impact, we will resort to other, more physical means, to do
what we deem as right. </P>
