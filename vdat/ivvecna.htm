<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In 1986, my parents gave me a CP-400 computer (a brazilian clone of
a TSR-80 Color2)... I always wished for a video-game, but my parents gave
me a comp... I found very few programs for my computer, and started to
code my own stuff... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started trying to code a virus in 1988... But it seems that to write
a virus that infects the K7 tape drives in a CP-400 is impossible... :)<BR>
In 1992 I got a 386, and released in the wild my first working virus a
couple of months later... It was a non-res companion ('a la' GoldBug) written
in Turbo Pascal... I spread it in all BBS's that I could find, and it is
still in the wild on some BBS's, that still have my virus dropper online
(a fake utility to double the size of the RAM). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm not very proud of my virus in pascal, neither my first virus in
asm, but I consider them a step in improving my actual coding skills...
I consider my latest virii very good, although they don't show all I can
do and I'm proud of them... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I dunno... The names are of things that sometimes appear in my mind...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>BASIC, C/C++, Pascal, Delphi, Assembler for 80x86 and 6908e and a couple
of others in a minor way, like pearl, lisp, forth, fortran, cobol, etc...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Lately, I code almost exclusively in assembler, even for non-virii things
Sometimes I code in Pascal and Delphi too... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yep... <A HREF="groups2.htm#SGWW">Stealth Group World Wide</A>...<B>
<I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Vecna is now (2/98) a <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A>
member / Cicatrix]</FONT></I></B></P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I use AVP and TBAV... Lately, I started to test DrWeb, IceNOD and Adinf.
They seem pretty good... I think that the best virus defense is an integrity
checker, expecialy one allows you to rename the checksums databases, to
avoid deletion by antivirus... The worst antivirus is McAfee's Scan...
I don't need to explain why.... ;&gt; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My objectives in virus scene are almost the same that I have in life...
Know how things work, do interesting things, know people, and especially,
*CHANGE* things that I consider wrong...<BR>
I know that virus coding and spreading, especially the destructive ones
like mine, is a form of terrorrism... I can't stop thinking about people
that lost their data because one of my virii, and I'm very sorry for this...<BR>
But this form of terrorrism is the only way that a south-american guy can
help to destroy the imperialism that reigns in our world... I know that
this is a tiny blow, but is a duty of all good men fight evil... Even if
the weapon is as inoffensive as a virus... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>This war is a commercial one... The virus writers, in the majority,
are guys that want to create mindless havoc, without a definite objective,
and the AVs are guys that do a simple job... The only want to have money...<BR>
Very few people, in both sides, fight because they feel they are doing
something right... Some want money, some want recognition, respect, and
like.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I got this handle from the AD&amp;D rpg game... I have others nicks,
but always in Portuguese... The virus that I published in <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD#7</A>
was under the handle Vecna, and peoples start to know me by this handle...<BR>
I don't like the handle 'Vecna' very much... I still prefer 'Sangue Sujo'...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They are used, generally, by guys that have no other wish than to create
havoc... Although to create havoc helps me in my project of changing wrong
things, I don't have too much respect, as virus writer, for people that
use them.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like macro virii very much, because I don't see anything advanced
in them... But recently, <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A> started to
do good things in this field.. Assembly is still the best language to code
virus, because that language works very fast and is very small, and can
access the hardware directly... HLL virii are fine, but they need to be
advanced... Overwriting or parasite non-res virii are worthless, in the
world of today, being in asm or HLL...<BR>
I consider a virus, be it in WordBasic, HLL or assembler, like a book...
They serve to spread ideas... If you have a good idea, the type of paper
that you use is not important... The same happen with virus... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yep... Hardcore2(boot) and a HLL virus are in the wild in Brazil...<BR>
Outsider (BOOT/FILE) was spread through Internet and will be in the wild
soon I hope... I must thank <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A> for the
release of a macro construction kit and for including my Vecna (BOOT/FILE)
virus in a release... The macro virus will drop the virus when it activate...
I think that this will spread this virus very well. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like almost all e-zines... <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29a</A> and <A HREF="ezines1.htm#IV">Infected
Voice</A> are that ones that I consult most frequntly, because the technical
text...<BR>
The only ones that I don't like are the <A HREF="ezines1.htm#EVOL">YAM</A>
and some <A HREF="ezines1.htm#MINO">argentinian vx zines</A>... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I found Yosha a very nice guy, good coder and nice friend... I like
very much of Pockies too... I think that all peoples of #virus are nice...<BR>
Other guy that I like is Eternal Maverick, the only guy that I can have
a technical discussion... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know the AV world very much... Seens that Veldman and Kaspery
are good coders... I respect good coders... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Che Guevara and Bakunin in politicals... Maybe Fidel Castro and Mao
Tse Tung too... Pavlov, Skinner and Piaget have a nice work in the study
of the human psyche... Vigotsky and Chomsky in their work about linguistic...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We live in a sick world, and sometimes we need use sick weapons... I
personally use destructive payloads in my virii... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yep... A virus, a book, a picture that helps to change the mind of people
in a positive way is always a good thing... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I study in university and work... I studing 'Fonoaudiologia'(dunno the
english name), a branch of medicine and pshychologic that studies human
communication... A 'fonoaudiologo' is a professional that helps deaf, mutes,
peoples with neurologic problems to communicate and live a better life...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My parents and my girl know... Other peoples also know, because i was
kicked from my first university for coding and spreading virus... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have a basic knowledge about hacking from my BBS days, and use this
and warez trading sometimes... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Virii should not be illegal... But because they hurt the political elite,
they are...<BR>
Writing a virus is like writing a book... Spreading a virus is like doing
what your book says... It is good that people write a virus, but it is
better that they spread it too...<BR>
A book about human rights is a good thing, but is better if the writer
also does the thing that he wrote...Writing is the theory... Spreading
is the practice... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In the technical view point, the better virus is the one that the victim
only detect when there's no way back... Compatibility is the key word<BR>
A virus that can fullfil the wishes of the author is a perfect virus...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well... Is a new platform to infect, and it makes things easier to people,
so people will use it more and more, so, if we can infect it, we will be
able to reach your objectives better...<BR>
I personaly don't like win95, and I'm a DOS coder, although this will change
soon... I hope... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Be creative, and don't get kicked of university doing stupid things,
like putting in the virus the same handle that you have in your email adress...
;&gt; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Email me at <A HREF="mailto:vecna_br@hotmail.com">vecna_br@hotmail.com</A>
or talk with me in undernet #virus... I will give you my PGP key and another
email adress where you can find me... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think that I learn a bit with all people that I talked to in my life...<BR>
I thank the world... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you get into SGWW? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I was searching a group to join, and saw the email of SGWW in VLAD#7...
I got email from LovinGOD, and send a message... I showed LovinGOD my betas
from OUTSIDER virus, and I was accepted... I joined to SGWW because I can
work in a major group, with good coders to exchange ideas and liberty to
use my destructive payloads... Also I like the view point that LovinGOD
has about destructive payloads very much... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is SGWW organized? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I really dont know... I only know that LovinGOD is the president, and
Caesar is the president in Ukraine... I not even know the handle of all
members... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is the virus scene in South America? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The country that has the most virus writers is Argentina... But the
Argentinians have the nasty habit of thinking yourself about all others
(I know this... I was born in Argentina, although I have lived in Brazil
since I was 3 years)<BR>
I talked, through IRC, with Darkside1 and Jack Qwerty, that are very nice
guys... Darkside1 said me that Dark Chacal, a SLAM member, is Brazilian
too, but I never talked with him...<BR>
It seems that not many people code virii here... But the number seems to
be growning... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will you ever release a virus creator? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I read an article from Bontchev, talking about this... A good and very
variable virus creator can be ultimate weapon against AVs... We can code
thousands of virus with the kit and send directly to AVs companys... They
will need extract scan string, update the scanners and like... If they
decide to ignore us, we can start to spread some of them, or send it to
small companies, that will happily say the their scanners detect 10.000
virii that the others scanner don't...<BR>
This will be the downfall of scanning... Only integrity checker will survive...
Maybe, if I found people to work with me, I could code this virus creation
kit... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is in your future and the future of SGWW?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I will slow down my virus coding, because I found it more helpfull to
people to spend my time helping the society with 'fonoaudiologia'... And
I need to finish the university... But I don't think I'll stop virus coding...<BR>
Although the only member that I have frequent contact with is Eternal Maverick,
I think that SGWW is still strong, and will be strong in the future...
We have very good coders... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will SGWW increase the number of members? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Good coders and peoples with ideas will always be welcome... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will SGWW go into other scenes except VX? (hacking,
etc.) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think that SGWW is and will be only a virus group... </P>
