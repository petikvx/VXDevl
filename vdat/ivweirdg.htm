<P> <font color="#004080"><b>How did u get your name "Weird Genius" ? </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I was programming my second assembly virus together with a friend somewhere 
    in 1994 and up to then we used the names Psycho & Freud. When I solved a programming 
    problem in an inventive way, Freud said: you're a genius, but a weird one. 
    That's how I got that name :^) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programing languages did you know ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> When I started coding viruses I knew Basic and very little Pascal. I learned 
    assembly by doing the whole lot, writing on overwriting COM infector of 30 
    bytes and so on. When MS Office came around Visual Basic was my next language. 
    I do not know any C++ etc. Even if I wanted to know about it, I just don't 
    have the time to learn it :^( </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Did you join a vx group before you join to the Codebreakers 
  ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Nope, Codebreakers is the first group I joined. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Why did you join the Codebreakers ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Two reasons, first of all I wanted my creations to gain some attention. 
    The assembly viruses I wrote took about 4!! years to appear in the AV lists. 
    I published the source code on www.ilf.net then and suddenly everyone (AV) 
    knew it. Now when I write something, people know where to find it instantly 
    :^) </p>
  <p> Second reason is that Codebreakers has a very open structure which is accessible 
    for the newbie. If someone comes with a good question that person will defenitly 
    get a serious answer. I like that approach. Programming a virus is easy once 
    you know the basics. But to write a virus and be creative doing it with completely 
    new things in it is difficult. That is what I want to tell new people. (And 
    help them doing it) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which AV programs did you try for yourself ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I used to use TBAV when I was writing ASM bugs, I really loved the heuristic 
    part of it as the flags produced by the scanner would give away exactly what 
    TBAV was looking for in the code. This made it very easy to bypass and most 
    of the times other scanners would not find the virus then as well. </p>
  <p> Since I work with VBA I use AVP, but I have to say that all AV software 
    that looks for Macro viruses sucks big time. I don't understand that it it 
    still possible to write a macro virus that is undetectable. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Why do you think this AV program is the best ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't :^) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which viruses do you think are the viruses of the 
  next generation ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Cross platform viruses, spreading from VBA to EXE to DLL to HTML whatever. 
    The more platforms one virus can jump the more difficult it is to get rid 
    of it. Size of viruses don't have to be that small anymore. The majority of 
    computer users don't look at the size of a file anymore, the only thing they 
    look at is how many gig's are still free on their hard drive and when it's 
    full, they add one. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How many viruses have you coded ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> About 10 I guess, two of them in 1994 DNA.1206 and Getpass (Weird.1800) 
    where assembly viruses. (Getpass is funny as it steals Novell 3.12 passwords) 
    Then I quit writing viruses for a long time. Decided to write some again in 
    1998 and then started to code Macro viruses. Easy and funny :^) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What did you think about destructive payloads in 
  viruses ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Nothing, I wouldn't do it. There's a lot of arguments that every virus is 
    a treath even when it has no intention to destroy data. I tend to agree with 
    that. But since I am a virus writer, I try to minimize the damage as much 
    as possible:^) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which payloads did you try in your viruses ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Mainly annoing payloads. Getpass would collect Novell usernames and password 
    and print them on the first of the month. My macro viruses have some payload 
    like a message box or refusing to open a document on a Sunday afternoon :^) 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Did you spread your viruses and when how did you 
  do it ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I did never spread my viruses, but I always publish the source code. It 
    is surprising to see how the AV world is monitoring the VX sites. Where it 
    took 4 years to have DNA and Getpass in the AV lists, it now takes about two 
    weeks before my bugs appear in there. (Congrats to AVP, you're the best doing 
    that) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What did you think about java viruses ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> To be honest, I haven't looked at it much and because of that I always have 
    Java disabled. Hehehe. It is an interesting concept and I will have to look 
    into it in the near future. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which viruses will you create in the next future 
  ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't know yet, for now I still enjoy writing macro viruses. But I probably 
    will write something in assembly again in the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Greets to other VXér and groups </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> OK, there we go: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> All the CodeBreakers </li>
  <li> VicodinES (retired, but I'm pretty sure he's still lurkin:^) </li>
  <li> Webmaster 'Virus' </li>
  <li> AVM </li>
  <li> Foxz from NoMercy </li>
  <li> Freud (1967 - 1995) I will not forget you my friend. </li>
</ul>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Hate messages to: </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> No one. I'm not a hatefull person, Even no hate message to Fred Cohen. I 
    think that with his actions he has become himself that what he seems to hate 
    the most... </p>
  <p> Just one remark left. Browsing trough alt.comp.virus for example I cannot 
    ignore the fact that a lot of AV people are acting just as 'childly' as they 
    claim virus writers are acting. One remark to those people, if the VX world 
    would stop writing a single virus for the next few years you will have to 
    find new way's to put bread on your table. Be aware that, altough you hate 
    our guts, we are also your means of existance. </p>
  <p> Ugh! </p>
