<P>To get a better idea of how a virus can attack a computer, think of
the computer as a walking, talking, living person and the computer virus
as a biological virus. To aid in this analogy, we've included a table written
by Ralf Burger and Rune Skardhamar as a comparison between Biological Viruses
and Computer Viruses. Please note, this table refers to an IBM-PC Compatible
computer running the MS-DOS operating system: </P>

</TABLE>

<P>While this table give you an idea of how a computer virus is similar
to a biological virus, it is not entirely correct. </P>

<P>In the biological systems, a virus can infect a cell more than once.
In fact, a cell may be infected by many viruses at the same time. This
creates the possibility of viral interactions leading to mutations of the
viruses. A similar effect may happen in a virus infested computer system.
Several different computer viruses may infect the same program at the same
time. While in biological viruses this may result in new mutations, in
computer viruses this usually results in a non-functional virus and a corrupted
file. </P>

<P>Rune Skardhamar, author of <B><I>VIRUS Detection and Elimination</I></B>,
has created a slightly more up to date comparison chart (included below).</P>

<TR>
<TD>Biological viruses are parasitic. They need a cell in which to live
and reproduce. </TD>

<TD>Computer viruses are parasitic. They need another program to exist
and in which to reproduce.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Once a cell has been infected, the infected cell is forced to make
new copies of the virus.</TD>

<TD>Once a program has been infected, it is forced to make new copies of
the virus.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Biological viruses rarely, if ever, infect the same cell twice.</TD>

<TD>Computer viruses seldom infect the same program/disk twice.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Specific biological viruses target specific cell types.</TD>

<TD>Specific computer viruses target specific program types (EXE, COM,
SYS, etc.).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>An infected cell can go on living for a long time without any obvious
sign of infection.</TD>

<TD>An infected program need not show any obvious sign of the infection.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>After an incubating time of varied length, a biological virus often
releases some kind of payload, which can prove fatal to the whole living
system in which the infected cell lives</TD>

<TD>After an incubating time of varied length, a computer virus often releases
some kind of payload, which can prove fatal to the whole system in which
the virus-infected program lies.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The DNA of a typical small virus, such as the polio virus, contains
information that if reproduced on a computer would add up to some 5,000
bytes. The smallest virus discovered to date is equal to about only 200
bytes.</TD>

<TD>A typical computer virus has a size of some 1,000-3,000 bytes. However,
if the DOS interrupt subroutine (called by the <B>int</B> instruction)
is added to that, the full size can easily be multiplied by two (And that's
not even counting the microcode actually being executed by the CPU.)</TD>
