<b><font color="#004080">Before we begin is there anything you would like to confess? 
</font></b> 
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm a HLL coder, My spelling sucks and I'm just me :-) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Who are you, what do you do, what kind of music do 
  you like etc.. and how did you get your nick?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I'm Knowdeth, I'm a HLL Coder, not to be confused with macro coder <br>
    I do code macro's but also Batch, VBS, QB, VB and played with mIRC Script. 
    <br>
    What kinda music do I like.. Well Punk and Metal mostly but I do like some 
    Techno/Industrial and Alternative. <br>
    Ahh my nick, Thats a long story and boreing hehe :-) I'll sum it up with just 
    a Ex g/f told me I didnt know death. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Where are you from? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>USA </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How would you describe yourself (eg. mad, antisocial, 
  above average intelligence etc..)? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I guess I would call myself friendly and helpful, some have called me crazy 
    but ah well :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you get involved in the VX scene? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>After a WelcomB infection I wanted to learn more about them so I got to collecting 
    virii. I found I liked HLL virii better because of the fact of what a HLL 
    coder must face. Its not like asm where you have control, I've been with it 
    every since. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Are you part of any VX team, if so which one(s) and 
  fer how long? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I'm leader of <a href="groups2.htm#META">Metaphase VX Team</a> and I'm a 
    member of <a href="groups2.htm#NOMERCY">NoMercyVirusTeam </a><br>
    I've been in Metaphase over a year and a half and about 3-4 months as a member 
    of NoMercy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How many viruses have you written to date, and which 
  do you feel was the 'best' one? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I know at least 30+. The best one, Well it would have to be the one I havent 
    written yet. :-) Each time I code a new one It was better than the last as 
    long as I keep improveing my new one will always be my fav. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you see as the future fer yourself (and your 
  team(s))? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I see new'er and better HLL, as long as M$ gives us somthing to work with 
    it will always be that way. I see things heading more Internet also. It is 
    the new fronteer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What languages do you know? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I know basic (and most subsets eg. GW, QB,), Batch, VB, VBA, VBS, C++, mIRC 
    Script, Pascal, VC++, Cobol, HTML, J++, JS, Perl, Delphi and Fortran. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Are there any viruses in particular which you think 
  were good (eg. great survival, stealth, encryption etc..)? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>What I think are good are new idea's. Sometimes Ideas that are new are better 
    than survival ect, just to show that it is possible to be done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of viral payloads - and more specifically 
  destructive payloads? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I love a good payload, graphical, a lil trick even a new virus, but I DISLIKE 
    destructive payloads. Why Make a virus if your going to make it kill itsself? 
    A virus that kills it host kills itself. If you wanna hurt someone code trojans 
    and dont waste your time learning any lauange use QB 4.5 and do a &quot;shell 
    c:\deltree c:\*.* /y&quot; See anyone can do a trojan but few can do a good 
    virus :-) so why waste the time with that junk and why be lame and hurt the 
    system?. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Unique question here - Can you describe the perfect 
  virus? </b> </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Windows 9.x?? perfect virus, eats everything and takes total control. hehe, 
    really I hope I never see a &quot;perfect&quot; virus</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What is your opinion of pro-virus members/groups, 
  and why? </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There my family, My brothers, sisters and cusins. <br>
    I see everyone in the scene family, and its the way it should be keeping us 
    strong! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What is your opinion of anti-virus members/companies, 
  and why? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Rod Fewster is killer, Nick Fitz needs to be killed. <br>
    Depends on the person, AV are about money.. How many major AV's are freeware? 
    hehe Its just my hobby to get around them. Its people like Nick Fitz and Sarah 
    Gordon that keep my codeing strong. So I guess I gotta tell um thanks for 
    pissin me off hehe :-) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>If Microsoft offered you a job to work on MSAV - Would 
  you take it? </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For what I would loose outta my life I dont thank they could agree to my 
    terms to even get me to work, <br>
