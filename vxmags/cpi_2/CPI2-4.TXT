        One of the  main problems with viruses is that  once you set one loose,
it is no longer under your control.  I propose to stop this by introducing some
standards of  virus writing that will  enable them to  be deactivated  whenever
they enter a 'friendly' (CPI) system.  In the long run,  even the author of the
virus is not immune to being attacked. The following are what I have termed the
CPI standards for writing viruses.  They will allow a virus to easily check any
system they are  being run on  for a type of 'identity badge'.  If it is found,
the virus will  not infect the  system it is being run on.  The other standards
are mostly written around this.

CPI Standards for writing viruses -

        1 - The virus will have  an 'active  period' and an  'inactive period'.
            The active periods will be no more than one year in length (to make
            it more difficult to discover the virus). You may release different
            versions of your virus  with different 'active periods'.  It is not
            recommended that your  virus deactivate itself after the set active
            period, as this would enable  people to deactivate viruses by using
            their computer with the date set  to 2069 or something.  It is also
            required  that  activation  periods  begin on January 1  and end on
            December 31. This will coincide  with the changing  identity codes.

        2 - The virus will check for an  identity code by  executing Interrrupt
            12h  with the  following register  settings:  AX - 4350, BX - 4920,
            CX - AB46, DX - 554E.  If the system  is  friendly, then a  pointer
            will be returned in CX:DX to an ASCIIZ (0-terminated) string  which
            will have different contents in different years.  The codes are not
            to be included in any text file,  and should only  be given through
            E-mail on CPI affiliated systems.  You can always ask me by sending
            me  mail at  The Andromeda Strain BBS.  If a system  is detected as
            friendly, the virus will not attempt to infect or damage it, but it
            is ok  to display a  little  greeting message  about  how lucky the
            user was.

        3 - We very much encourage you to upload your virus, along with a breif
            description on the  workings into the  CPI section at The Andromeda
            Strain BBS.  Only CPI members  will know about your virus.  This is
            so that CPI members  can share techniques and  it also allows us to
            verify that  the identity check works.  If we see  any improvements
            that could be made, such as ways to streamline code, better ways of
            spreading, etc. we will inform you so that you can make the changes
            if you wish.

        4 - It is also suggested that you use ADS standard for virus storage on
            infected disks.  This meathod uses disk slack space for storage and
            is more thoroughly described in a previous text file by me. I think
            that this is the most effective  and invisible way to store viruli.

        5 - A list of CPI-Standard  viruli will be  avaliable at all times from
            The Andromeda Strain BBS, to CPI users.  Identity strings will also
            be available to anyone in CPI, or anyone who uploads source code to
            a virus which is 100%  complete except for  the Identity string (it
            must be written to CPI-Standards). Non-CPI members who do this will
            be more seriously considered for membership in CPI.
