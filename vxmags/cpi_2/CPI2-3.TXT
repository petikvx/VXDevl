         "Ok, I've written the virus, now where the hell do I put it?"

        Ok,  wow!  You've just  invented  the most  incredibly nifty virus.  It
slices, it dices, it squshes,  it mushes (sorry Berke Breathed)  people's data!
But the only problem is, if you go around infecting every damn file,  some cute
software company is going to  start putting in  procedures that  checksum their
warez each time they run, which will make life for your infecting virus a total
bitch. Or somebody's going to come up with an incredibly nifty vaccination util
that will wipe it out. Because, i mean,  hey,  when disk space starts vanishing
suddenly in 500K chunks people tend to notice.  Especially people  like me that
rarely have more than 4096 bytes free on their HD anyway. Ok.  So you're saying
"wow, so what, I can make mine fool-proof", etc, etc. But wait! There's no need
to go around wasting your precious time when the answer is right there in front
of you! Think about it,  you could be putting that time into writing better and
more inovative viruses,  or you could be  worring about keeping  the file size,
the date & time, and the attributes the same.  With this system,  you only need
to infect one file, preferably one that's NOT a system file, but something that
will get run alot, and will be able  to load your nifty virus on a daily basis.
This system also doesn't take up any disk space, other than the loader. And the
loader could conceivably be under  16 bytes (damn near undetectable).  First of
all, you need to know what programs to infect. Now, everybody knows about using
COMMAND.COM and that's unoriginal anyway,  when there are other programs people
run all the time. Like DesqView  or Norton Utilities or  MASM or  a BBS file or
WordPerfect; you get the idea. Better still are dos commands like Format,  Link
or even compression utilities.  But you get the point. Besides,  who's going to
miss 16 bytes, right? Now, the good part: where to put the damn thing. One note
to the programmer:  This could get  tricky if  your virus  is over  2k or isn't
written in Assembly, but the size problem is easy enough, it would  be a simple
thing to break your virus  into parts and have  the parts load each  other into
the system so that you do eventually get the whole thing. The only problem with
using  languages besides assembly  is that it's  hard to  break them up into 2k
segments. If you want to infect floppys, or smaller disks, you'd be best off to
break your file into 512 byte segments, since they're easier to hide. But, hey,
in assembly, you can generate pretty  small programs that do alot, tho.  Ok, by
now you've probably figured  out that we're talking  about the part of the disk
called 'the slack'. Every disk that your computer uses is divided up into parts
called sectors, which are (in almost all cases) 512 bytes. But in larger disks,
and even in floppies,  keeping track of every single sector would be a complete
bitch. So the sectors  are bunched together  into groups  called 'clusters'. On
floppy disks,  clusters are  usually  two sectors,  or 1024 bytes,  and on hard
disks, they're typically 4096 bytes, or eight sectors.  Now think about it, you
have  programs on  your  hard disk,  and what are  the odds that they will have
sizes that always end up in increments of 4096? If I've  lost you,  think of it
this way: the file takes up a  bunch of  clusters,  but in  the last cluster it
uses, there is usually some 'slack', or space that isn't used by the file. This
space is between where the actual file ends and  where the actual cluster ends.
So, potentially, you can have up  to 4095 bytes of 'slack'  on a file on a hard
disk, or 1023 bytes of 'slack' on a floppy.  In fact, right now, run the Norton
program  'FS /S /T'  command from your root directory,  and subtract  the total
size of the files from the total disk space used. That's how much 'slack' space
is on your disk (a hell of alot, even on a floppy). To  use the slack,  all you
need to do  is to  find a  chunk of slack  big enough to  fit your  virus (or a
segment of your virus)  and use direct disk access (INT 13)  to put  your virus
there.  There is one minor  problem with this.  Any disk write to that  cluster
will overwrite the slack with 'garbage' from memory. This is because of the way
DOS manages it's disk I/O and it can't  be fixed without alot of hassles.  But,
there is a way around even this. And it involves a popular  (abeit outdated and
usually ineffectual) form of  virus protection called the READ-ONLY flag.  This
flag is the greatest friend  of this type of virus.  Because if the file is not
written to,  the last cluster is not written to, and voila!  Your virus is safe
from mischivious accidents.  And since the R-O flag doesn't  affect INT 13 disk
I/O, it won't be in your way. Also, check for programs with the SYSTEM flag set

because that has the same Read-only effect (even tho I haven't seen it written,
it's true that  if the  file is designated system,  DOS treats it as read-only,
whether the R-O flag is set or not).  The space after IBMBIOS.COM or IBMDOS.COM
in MS-DOS (not PC-DOS, it uses different files,  or so I am told; I've been too
lazy to find out myself) or a protected (!) COMMAND.COM  file in either type of
DOS would be ideal for this. All you have to do is then insert your loader into
some innocent-looking file, and you are in business.  All your loader has to do
is read  the sector into  the highest part of memory,  and do a far call to it.
Your virus cann then go  about waiting  for floppy disks  to infect,  and place
loaders on any available executable file on the disk. Sound pretty neet? It is!
Anyway, have fun, and be sure to upload your virus, along with a README file on
how it works to CPI  Headquarters so we  can check it out!  And remember: don't
target P/H/P boards  (that's Phreak/Hack/Pirate boards) with ANY virus. Even if
the Sysop is a leech and you want to  shove his balls down his throat.  Because
if all the PHP boards go down (especially members of CPI), who the hell can you
go to for all  these nifty  virus ideas?  And besides,  it's betraying your own
people,  which  is uncool even  if you  are an anarchist.  So, target uncool PD
boards, or your  boss's computer  or whatever,  but don't attack  your friends.
Other than that, have phun, and phuck it up!

PS: Watch it, this file (by itself) has about 3 1/2k of slack (on a hard disk).

Call these boards because the sysops are cool:
Oblivion                (SATAN HQ)   Sysop: Agent Orange   (SATAN leader)
System: Utopia          (SATAN HQ)   Sysop: Robbin' Hood   (SATAN leader)
The Andromeda Strain    (CPI HQ)     Sysop: Acid Phreak    (CPI leader)
D.U.N.E.                (DUNE HQ)    Sysop: Freddy Krueger (DUNE leader)
The Jolly Bardsmen's Pub & Tavern
The Sierra Crib
The Phrozen Phorest
Knight Shadow's Grotto

And if I forgot your board, sorry, but don't send me E-mail bitching about it!
