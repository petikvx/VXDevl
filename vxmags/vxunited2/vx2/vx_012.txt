BAT.Oneline is a single line batch worm and virus with built in critical error
handeler.  It will replicate/copy to every directory in the path.  It appends
a keep-alive statement to each batch file in the path.  It works with Windoze
95.  It creates C:\WINSTART.BAT so that each time Windoze starts it reinfects.

******In order to have this fit in the zine, i had to edit it of course... to 
put it back in its original state, just hit backspace once when the cursor is 
at the begining of each line, or just see the .bat in the zip file included.***
