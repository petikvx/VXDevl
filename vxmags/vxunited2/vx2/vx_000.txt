	Welcome to the second issue of Vx United! Whew., I'm glad to say that.
This was a project that I was unsure if it was ever going to be completed.
A lot of things have changed since the last issue, in the computer world, and 
in mine. School started, been working, doing way too much partying., you know 
the routine. As far as the vx world, there has been many accomplishments. The 
release of the first java virus (strange brew) was something that most people 
said would never happen. This again shows that if someone leaves a fault, then 
someone else will always find and exploit that fault. Also the exploits of html
and browser configurations allowed the first html viruses to form, and those 
nifty little winscript viruses have also come to light. It has been a busy time
since the first issue of this zine.
	The release of a security tool from Cult of the Dead Cow (Back Orifice)
is another great example of peoples will to exploit things. Now anyone can have
almost total control of a remote win95/98 machine with the help of a simple, 
easy to install trojan.,.hehe,. Despite the arrogant press releases from 
microsoft, im sure they did sweat it, and im sure they will take action against
the weakness of their OS sometime. "It's not a problem" is just not gonna cut
it with this one. That, and the fact that linux is on the rise, im sure we are 
going to get some sort of show from microsoft within the next year or so. I 
dunno, lets just wait and see.,.hehehe., (that line was written before i found
out that they are releasing the next version of winNT as windows2000 or 
whatever, which is a whole different debate on its own.. gotta love those 
guys.)
	Lets see, what else has gone on. The codebreaks released the 4th issue 
of their zine, and by now i should be looking for the 5th. During the process 
of putting together this zine, the coder of this viewer has become a member 
of their crew. Big ups to ya Evil-E! 29a should be releasing their 3rd issue 
within a short period of time after you read this, but lets just wait and see.
Im excited as to see what those guys come up with next, and im looking forward
to seeing the source to that virus from GriYo which has its own SMTP server,.
geeze he is a nut. eheh,.
	I must say im sorry for the delay between the first issue and this. As
i said, a lot of shit has been going down. I gave everyone a break from having
me harass them for a donation, and i also didn't feel like putting much effort 
into it after the first was released. I got a few negative reactions due to 
including content from people who are strongly disliked in the vx world, and 
i am expecting that again. For those who know, just remember why this project
was started and my opinions about it. I don't think its my right to exclude a 
contribution because i don't like them on a personal basis. Im not involved
in drama, nor do i take sides, nor am i about ready to start any. Anyway, the 
third issue should be released with a shorter delay, as almost 5 months seems 
a little to long. Id like to push things to a monthly basis, but i dont think
that will ever happen. Its hard to get people to do work when they are busting
their ass with their own groups,.eeheh., It also keep getting delayed week by
week for one reason or another. It would have been here a week before if i had
not of gotten the flu and hurled out of my chix0rs car window doing 80mph down
i95 south between D.C and richmond. It also would have been out if everyone in
the world lived in the same damn time zone. Europe should be relocated to my 
side of the world damn it.
	The content of this issue is what i think great for the second run, as
people are starting to be a little more willing to donate to this project, and 
as im learning to package things together a little more. If things keep running
the way they are now, the third issue should of course be another major step in
the right direction. This issue is about 98% source code, which im not sure if 
its a problem or not yet, im looking forward to your reaction. New viruses and 
disassembles are always nice, and writing articles is not something a lot of 
coders want to spend their time doing. Remember, this zine is not compiled from
a group, so i don't have much control over what is done for it. Im hoping to 
include a few more articles than was published this time, so if your interested
just let me know.
	CIH hype, marburg being distributed on wargames and other cd's, RAiD's
Matrix virus registering avp, someone spamming hundreds of users from a spoofed
account of zvi, battles in alt.comp.virus, the return of some old school writers
, #vir growing everyday, sourceofkaos taking the web by storm, id say the virus 
scene is headed out strong once again. I dunno, maybe im being too optimistic, 
but it seems some great things are bound to happen on the way to the year 2000.
