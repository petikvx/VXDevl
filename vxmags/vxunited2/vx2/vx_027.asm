than 64k! If i had told evil-e and gotten him to recode the viewer, hell
knows when this zine would have been released. So just move on for now, 
and later have a look at vx_034.asm, that's the source to hare..


                          Sorry, 
                       and/or tough,
             depending on your attitude about this.
