	Last time around you guys got a little something old, now its time for
something new. Buzzo has been a great friend over the past year or so, and has
been involved in the vx scene for almost the same amount of time. Even though
he has been coding viruses long before then, he just was not around. After 
his efforts to get the invaders going, and watching it crumble before it ever
really got off its feet he let go of it. Soon after he was swept up by the 
Feathered Serpents for his coding abilities. Ive heard all sorts of crazy ideas
come outta this kid, so you guys better watch out. I expect to see something
great come out of him and the rest of the FS crew in the near future. Anyway,
I'm sure nobody wants to sit here and listen to me rant on about how this guy
is gonna be known one day, so move on and enjoy the second author spotlight!
