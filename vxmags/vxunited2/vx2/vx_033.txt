Info's about the viewer:
========================

This program was written in Turbo Pascal 7.0 with some inline assembler (for
speed). The source is 1732 lines long.
My viewer uses the 640x350 16 Color EGA-Mode. In this display mode you have
two screen pages. And that is all I want ;-).
I started writting this piece of code in august of this year. Hope you like
it. But unfortunately I don't have much time now. So I hope it runs error
free on your system. If not please send me an E-Mail.
I'm a proud member of the Codebreakers for about one month now.
So the world will hear from me again ...
