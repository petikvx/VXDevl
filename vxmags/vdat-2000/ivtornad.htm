<p><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you chose your handle?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back in the beginning of the 90's, I thought the name "TorNado" was great 
    for me, as it's something you can relate to the real world, and yet something 
    very destructive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you fit the geeky virus writer stereotype?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nooooo. I look pretty normal, but people who REALLY know me tell me that 
    I'm really strange, because I like to say and do totally insane things (I'm 
    a true DOMAIN freak).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What religious beliefs do you hold?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Religion really confuses me, but I do believe in the existence of something 
    greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you find out about computers?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I recieved my first SX Spectrum when I was 12, then later, a Commodore 64, 
    and when I was 16, my first IBM PC (286, 2MB memory, and a 120MB HDD).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you discover computer viruses?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In 1989 I read some articles in a computer magazine, concerning a post office 
    that was infected by the virus Friday the 13th, along with some other viruses 
    which were "in the wild" at the time. I was interested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you start writing viruses?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, me and Darkman were in the same class (Computer Science) and we started 
    to spend a lot of time in IRC (Unix style), and then suddenly he became a 
    member of <a href="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</a>, and that was my way into the 
    scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That depends. But I can give an example: When Yitzhak-Rabin was killed, I 
    thought that would be a perfect name for my next virus, which by the way was 
    spread widely in Denmark and around in Europe, and in lots of US universities 
    (none of which were done by me, I just wrote the virus). One of the big Internet 
    providers in Denmark called Datafellows for help, because it was all over 
    their site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages have you been fluent in?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pascal, C++, and Visual Basic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you like to lay out your source code?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I like to make it understandable for other people, like making a lot 
    of comments, remarks and stuff like that. I do this so that, hopefully, newbies 
    can learn from them, or at least grab some ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your thoughts on destructive code?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you had asked me that question 2 years ago, I would have said "I really 
    don't give a shit if it's destructive or not". But today, I really don't see 
    any beauty in destructive code - because it normally gets a virus caught quickly. 
    It's more interesting to see a peice of code that can integrate into an OS 
    without being noticed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How has your virus writing impacted your 'real life'?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I would say it hasn't impacted much, but true friends that know of my interaction 
    with viruess would say that it has had a big impact on me, because I have 
    spent so much time with virus writing. But it's nothing I go around and tell 
    to everybody, because most people have strange ideas about virus writers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you use yourself?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>AVP. It's the perfect AV tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your thoughts about those who create viruses in non-ASM languages?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Darkman once made a Pascal virus! What can I say? Assembly is the only language 
    where one can code a tight and well optimized virus, there is nothing more 
    to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do others in your personal life know that you write viruses?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Only 2 of my best friends know, and they are not family. Once I did try to 
    give my Uncle a hint (he is a Tandem programmer), but I don't think he got 
    my hint. Or, well, I don't know, we never talked about it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your virus infection hits a hospital and kills someone... are you depressed?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I would be depressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your thoughts on viruses and the law.</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Break the law. Nobody can enforce it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What virus technologies interest you the most?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Usually the ones I am busy creating :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your advice to those just beginning.</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Go find a good assembly language book, and READ it twice. Then go through 
    all of the virus magazines which are out and can be found on the Internet. 
    In my opinion, that's the best way to start out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What you think lies in the future of virus coding?</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We'll have to find out and explore that one ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus.</font></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn't exist.</p>
