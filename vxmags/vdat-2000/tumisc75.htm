<P> By seeing the title, you can think that this article will talk about the way 
  for defeat heuristic scanners and such like. No, my intention is to share my 
  ideas. This article wasn't dessigned for the ppl that doesn't have imagination. 
  I think that the imagination is our weapon, and this little document is only 
  about my ideas in a determinated moment of my life, so if you think i'm wrong, 
  just demonstrate it, and i'll very pleased. Anyway, here you have </P>
<P> <b>What is heuristic?</b></P>
<P> Is the analysis and the extrapolation of the data based in the experiences 
  that happened in the past, and its consequences. Yeah, the experience is the 
  mother of the science. This theory seems simple: too little lines... but the 
  concept is very important. Imagine you crash your car just after ignore a stop... 
  i'm sure that you won't do it anymore :) It seems that we (the humans) act basing 
  our knowledge in the experience of the errors we made in the past. </P>
<P> In another kind of language, we can say that the heuristic is the way for 
  le arn by basing our theories in the empiric knowledge. So now you can understand 
  what the hell the heuristic AV do: they search basing its criterions in the 
  "experience" of what the viruses use to do. But this isn't a 100% heuristic 
  software: the "experience" was previuosly coded, so the word heuristic is misused 
  when we are talking about an AV. </P>
<P> <b>A better approach to heuristic in AV</b></P>
<P> What do they search for? It's very simple, they search for the code of the 
  things that the viruses ussually do, as code for intercept functions, load the 
  boot sector, a decryption loop... So, don't believe the things the AV companies 
  ussually say (shit like "We detect the 100% of the known viruses and the unknown 
  too"), because that are fucking lies. The heuristic is easily foolable: just 
  do something strange for perform an ussual action, and voila! your virus is 
  anti-heuristics. Programs like TBAV have the huge fail that they don't look 
  the content of the registers so... what if we move in the register we want a 
  xored value, and later re-xor it? Hey! The AV will be mad ;) I've explained 
  more of this shit in the article "Harder to Detect", in this same magazine :) 
</P>
<P> <b>Interest for VX?</b></P>
<P>
 Mmmm... i find  this interesting. Just imagine if we code something that can
 learn the way that  a file is executed, using  only a  complex routine  that
 saves  each  step of the execution, and  the weak  points  of  the  executed 
 file, and  with enough criterion to decide if the file is infectable or not.
 It can sound like sci-fi, but i think that the computer viruses will grow in
 this way, in a  future. The objective is create something following moreless
 this shit:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
 .---------------------------.
 | Preparation for execution |--.
 '---------------------------'  |
 .---------------------------.  |
 | Program loaded in memory  |--|
 '---------------------------'  | .---------------------------.
                                |-| Virus following execution |
 .---------------------------.  | '---------------------------'
 | Execution                 |--|
 '---------------------------'  |
 .---------------------------.  |
 | Return control to OS      |--'
 '---------------------------'   
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P> The description is a little vague, i know, but it can (i hope) guide your 
  steps to the rite way. But i don't mean that the virus will be able to iden- 
  tify and infect new kinds of executables and such like. Remember that the heuristic 
  is based in the experience, so a good choice will be build tables for each file 
  executed, and when a determinated number of files of a determinated kind are 
  executed, compare each table and look what things are equal and what doesn't, 
  in order to catch all the usual things that the executable files do. So, we 
  will need as the basical "toolkit", for do something alike what i am trying 
  to describe, a good code emulator, and a lot of good ideas, because this matter 
  wasn't discussed in the past (at least i think it), and it needs an overdose 
  of good ideas. </P>
<P>
 The emulator, must  emulate ALL the program execution, and look for the most
 used things (interrupts and such like).
</P>
<P> <b>Sci-fi?</b></P>
<P>
 People, when reading this will think that i wrote it when i was drunk (well,
 it was :) , but i think that this  could be made, but in the future... When?
 I don't know. But it  could be made. The  only problem  could be the size: a
 good  emulator + a good code generator + the virus body = huge virus. But...
 who  cares about a virus of 30k? In  the HDs of the computers  of this  time
 there's  a lot of space... And if  you optimize your code a lot (hi Super!),
 the  size of the thingy  will decrease  a lot. Anyway,  nowadays there isn't
 something like  i'm trying  to describe... But there is a lot of interesting
 ideas about this same matter, and the ones i like most are the StarZer0 ones
 (hi T00FIC! ;). The nearest  approach of what i'm trying to describe are the
 metamorphic  viruses. But the  project of heuristic  applied  to  viruses is
 more complex (and cool i think :P).
</P>
<P> <b>Last Update</b></P>
<P> Coincidence? Bad luck? Fuck! I realized that <a href="tumisc72.htm">Rajaat 
  made an article</a> about the same matter as i do... but... the problem is that 
  i wrote this little article in late October/early November of 1998, and <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29A#3</a> 
  wasn't released yet! Anyway i think that this is a very different article, and 
  the only they have common is the label "Heuristic". Anyway, i hate my life. 
  Btw, i really recommend you to read Rajaat's document, because it's good to 
  see always more than a viewpoint in all the things of the life. (Rajaat: CoF 
  rulez!!!!) </P>
