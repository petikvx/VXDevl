<font color="#004080"><b>Normally nobody gets into the VX by accident.When and 
especially why did you choose to enter upon this career ? </b></font> 
<blockquote> 
  <p> Hello!! First of all, lemme tell you I am an "always learning" kind of guy. 
    By this I mean I always like to search, research, discover and test new things. 
    And, as programming represents what I like to do mostly, I keep on searching 
    and researching this area. Virus writting offers me the chance to try all 
    diferent aspects of programming... By virus writting and researching I get 
    in touch, sort of speak, with all insides of the computers. We got to admit 
    that because of viruses, many new technologies for data storage, data encryption 
    and security appeared. So, I choosed being a VXer because when you want to 
    learn you need a goal. The virus provides me that goal... By it, I learn...

<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you think about the virus writer's position 
  in this society ? Why aren't they accepted ? Is it only a question of ignorance 
  ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> The problem was discussed over and over again and as we speak I am writing 
    an article called "Perusing the virus writer mentality" which will be ready 
    soon... The virus writer's position in the society will _always_ be the one 
    of a paria... This because in the human mind, even if there are levels off 
    good and levels of bad, sometimes when it comes to consider somebody people 
    seem to throw everybody in the same bucket... If you kick a priest you are 
    really a bad guy... If you break a window... still the bad guy... It doesn't 
    matter that one action is more cruel than the other. So, as long as the virus 
    will exist as it is (a piece of code that attaches itself to other programs' 
    images), the virus writer will be considered a bad person. He will always 
    be the one that invaded honorable people's computers... And this way of thinking 
    comes, yes, sometimes out of ignorance. If one is not smart enough to make 
    a virus, he sure feels preety bad when he realizes somebody else was capable 
    of making something that conquered his system. I say that yes, its a certainity 
    that the virus writer will always be considered an anti-social person. </p>

<P> <font color="#004080"><b>"Lord Julus", why did you choose this name ? </b></font></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> The story goes like this: three years and a half ago, when I first discovered 
    the IRC I didn't quite know anything about it... So I looked up the help and 
    made a /list and then I joined a channel which had more people logged on to... 
    Suddenly I saw all the people that where there had nice nicks like: Sir something, 
    Count, Marquis, Baron, etc... Anyway, I quickly typed /nick Lord Julus... 
    Actually I wanted to be Julius, but so it came... ;-) Anyway, I stick to that... 
    I also used another nick from time to time and that's Viking Child... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which programming languages do you use ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Mostly ASM. I'm also a Borland Pascal programmer. I use C++ only for strange 
    things... Lately as I moved towards win32 I started using Visual C++ and Delphi... 
    But still ASM is my love... I sometimes use Visual Basic too for some quick 
    visual thigies... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where do you live and how is the situation of the 
  virus scene in your land ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Romania, that's my country... The situation of the virus scene here is that 
    it doesn't exist ;-(( The only virus writers which I know of are Virtual Daemon 
    (leader of <a href="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</a>), Alex (writer of Alex viruses), 
    RP & MuRPhy (authors of RP.family and Dodgy). But only I and VeeDee are curently 
    joined to a virus group and we share knoledge. Virus makers still exist (there 
    are quite many romanian viruses), but I haven't got a clue who they are... 
    But we have some AV dudes who make some romanian products (RAV and AVX - rav*.exe 
    and avx.exe for retro routines ;-))))) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Tell us something about your last projects...The 
  Undertaker and, of course, Manowar... </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I finaly decided I completely move to win32, therefore I left unfinished 
    most of my DOS work... I uploaded on my page my Whiplash viruses, but not 
    the multipartite Whiplash, which only had the BOOT infection routine ready. 
    The <a href="engine1.htm#MOF">MOF polymorphic engine</a> is still one thing 
    I am proud of but it didn't get used probably because of the way I made it 
    into a demo and hard to take out... Anyway, the demo files generated by MOF 
    are "recognized" by AVP as MbrKiller virus... Hahahaha... and there is nothing 
    to raise even 1 flag there!!! MOF32 is under work and almost ready... It's 
    a very neat poly I based my second poly article on... I use some smart arrays 
    to generate any kind of instructions... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">The win32 work consists until now of two major projects: 
  </font></b></P>
<ol start="2">
  <ol>
    <li> UNDERTAKER is a win32 virus that does this:<br>
      <br>
      - searches for the Kernel32<br>
      - searches for windows APIS<br>
      - locates 3 files in current directory, windows directory and system directory 
      and infects them by increasing the last section<br>
      - it is not polymorphic, but it uses a FPU encryption (actually FPU.Taylor 
      which calculates EXP(x) and uses the result in encryption)...<br>
      - I think it works ok on all win32 platforms... but I didn't check it on 
      something else than win95...<br>
      - has no payload, but a message window<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>MANOWAR is a win32 ring0 resident virus:<br>
      <br>
      - it only works on win95/98<br>
      - it gets ring0 by modifying the IDT<br>
      - uses VxD calls to get heap and goes resident<br>
      - hook the File System API<br>
      - on every .EXE file open it infects them<br>
      - uses SEH frame and error checking<br>
      - has no payload or message </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Also I have under work a great project called PExIC (Portable Executable 
    Infector Creator) which is a win32 virus mass creator. It will be pretty nice! 
    For now I finished only the IDE fully written in ASM... </p>
  <p> Now I work on a new virus... I realized that Ring0 cannot offer a WinNT 
    compatibility therefore I am trying to make a process spawner, combined with 
    a new technique I found (using the Process32First and Process32Next to locate 
    the running processes and as they close they get infected)... It'll be out 
    in a month or so... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where do you search for inspiration for writing something 
  of new ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I guess I let myself go with the flow... If I hear that maybe something 
    new is possible, I try to make it... Usualy I use a lot of books and text 
    files I have info in... I try to gather as much info as I can... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">You are a member of SLAM. Other groups you've worked 
  in/with ? Are there particular goals you and SLAM want to achieve ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Yep... But the fact is that I don't know how much the SLAM group will still 
    be as it is now... We are thinking to start over under a different name... 
    Who knows what is going to happen... I didn't work with anybody else (Mr.Sandman 
    published my first article in 29A#2), I tried to form my own one year ago 
    (HVC - Hottest Virus Congregation), but I couldn'd find people at the time 
    so I gave up... Here people are more shy... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Will the 32-bit OSs prevent beginners from learning 
  asm and writing viruses ? Won't they rather choose the "easy" way of macro than 
  studying asm ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> 16bit asm is also difficult. Actually the ones who start directly by studying 
    the 32bit programming will learn it faster then those who are masters of the 
    16bit... That's because the old 16bit environment pulls you back... And, I 
    have to say: 32bit programming is WAY more easy than 16 bit programming... 
    I mean, let's be serious... you don't have to remember difficult parameters 
    and many interrupt numbers, or ports... All you need is a book with the API 
    names and argument (Win32 help does it), push arguments on the stackand call 
    it by the name (which is more than logic). Also all the addressing modes possible 
    makes it way more easy!!! And the tricks... well every system has tricks... 
    once you learned the basics finding tricks is a game... So, I think that win32 
    viruses will overrun the 16 bit viruses in less than 2 years... And one thing 
    about macro: I HATE IT!!!!! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Have you ever considered to move totally to other 
  scenes like hacking or something like that ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Well... no... I think hacking is less fun... and more time consuming. I 
    think I'll stick to VX for now... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are there things you dislike within the VX ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Yes: the fact that sometimes there are intra-VX fights (virus writers or 
    virus groups have a sort of a fight for supremacy). This only leads to group 
    breaks, members flee and a general impression that the VX scene is a little 
    childish. Conclusion: we don't have enough unity... Also I don't like at all 
    destructive activity. Viruses are fun, but only until they kill... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Special criteria of choosing your virus' names ? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Nope... Just what gets thru my mind... Manowar is the name of my all time 
    favorite heavy metal band... I am thinking of making a Manowar serie... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Does the VX have an influence on your life/friends 
  ? Has it changed ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> No! My life didn't change a bit... I have thousand of friends, a gorgeous 
    girlfriend named Moniue, I have enough time to go to the sea-side, mountains, 
    bars and so... I think it's a good equiliber (how do I spell this? ;-))) between 
    my life and my virus research... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you want to make an appeal to anyone ?(beginners, 
  ex-writers, whole scene) </font></b> </P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I think it's a human quality to like to make an appeal. Those who don't 
    want it are introvertites or selfish persons... Yes I like it... Sometimes 
    maybe too much. I admit it's a bad characteristic of mine... But I always 
    admit that in my stuff there exist the knowledge of hundred others I admire 
    and respect... Any beginner "likes" people who seem to know more... I remember 
    when I was a completely beginner and I looked up at people which I find out 
    later that were not quite as I imagined... So I like to tell people exactly 
    what I know, where do I know it, why is it useful and how to use it... If 
    they like it or not... it's their bussiness... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What else do you do when you aren't coding a virus 
  ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I graduated the college in 1997 and I work now. I also write SF stories 
    and poems... I adore the actress Sandra Bullock and I have a lot of posters 
    with her... In most of my free time I listen music (Manowar, DIO, Rainbow, 
    Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc...). </p>
