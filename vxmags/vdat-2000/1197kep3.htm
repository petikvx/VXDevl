<P><B>DIGITAL IMMUNE SYSTEM</B> for cyberspace is planned to work as shown
here. An unknown virus spurs a client machine to forward a sample to an
administrative machine <B>(1)</B>, which in turn sends an encrypted sample
to a central virus-analysis machine <B>(2)</B>. This machine replicates
the virus in a &quot;petri dish&quot; device and analyzes its behavior
and structure <B>(3)</B>. The resulting prescription is sent back to the
administrative machine <B>(4)</B>, which forwards it first to the infected
client <B>(5)</B> and then to other machines on the local network <B>(6)</B>.
Subscribers around the world receive regular antivirus updates that protect
them from the new virus <B>(7)</B>.</P>
