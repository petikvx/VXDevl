Future</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>In our health-conscious society, viruses of any type are an enemy. Computer
viruses are especially pernicious. They can and do strike any unprotected
computer system, with results that range from merely annoying to the disastrous,
time-consuming and expensive loss of software and data. And with corporations
increasingly using computers for enterprise-wide, business-critical computing,
the costs of virus-induced down-time are growing along with the threat
from viruses themselves. Concern is justified - but unbridled paranoia
is not. Just as proper diet, exercise and preventative health care can
add years to your life, prudent and cost-effective anti-virus strategies
can minimize your exposure to computer viruses. </P>

<P>Because Symantec is the world's largest supplier of anti-virus technology,
we are uniquely able to offer comprehensive virus protection options and
service plans. As an introduction, we offer this white paper series. In
concise text, graphs and illustrations, we will give you a overview of:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>A history of computer viruses </LI>

<LI>Who writes viruses - and how they can reach you </LI>

<LI>The early warning symptoms of virus infection </LI>

<LI>The real numbers behind the growth of viruses and their costs </LI>

<LI>How viruses work - and how virus protection can stop them </LI>

</UL>

<P><B>What, Exactly, Is A Computer Virus?</B></P>

<P>A computer virus is a program designed to replicate and spread, generally
with the victim being oblivious to its existence. Computer viruses spread
by attaching themselves to other programs (e.g., word processors or spreadsheets
application files) or to the boot sector of a disk. When an infected file
is activated - or executed - or when the computer is started from an infected
disk, the virus itself is also executed. Often, it lurks in computer memory,
waiting to infect the next program that is activated, or the next disk
that is accessed. </P>

<P>What makes viruses dangerous is their ability to perform an event. While
some<BR>
events are benign (e.g. displaying a message on a certain date) and others
annoying (e.g., slowing performance or altering the screen display), some
viruses can be catastrophic by damaging files, destroying data and crashing
systems. </P>

<P><B>How Do Infections Spread?</B></P>

<P>Viruses come from a variety of sources. Because a virus is software
code, it can be transmitted along with any legitimate software that enters
your environment: </P>

<UL>
<LI>In a 1991 study of major U.S. and Canadian computer users by the market
research firm Dataquest for the National Computer Security Association,
most users blamed an infected diskette (87 percent). Forty-three percent
of the diskettes responsible for introducing a virus into a corporate computing
environment were brought from home.<I>1</I> </LI>

<LI>Nearly three-quarters (71 percent) of infections occurred in a networked
environment, making rapid spread a serious risk. With networking, enterprise
computing and inter-organizational communications on the increase, infection
during telecommunicating and networking is growing. </LI>

<LI>Seven percent said they had acquired their virus while downloading
software from an electronic bulletin board service. </LI>

<LI>Other sources of infected diskettes included demo disks, diagnostic
disks used by service technicians and shrink-wrapped software disks - contributing
six percent of reported infections. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What Damage Can Viruses Do To My System?</B></P>

<P>As mentioned earlier, some viruses are merely annoying, others are disastrous.
At the very least, viruses expand file size and slow real-time interaction,
hindering performance of your machine. Many virus writers seek only to
infect systems, not to damage them - so their viruses do not inflict intentional
harm. However, because viruses are often flawed, even benign viruses can
inadvertently interact with other software or hardware and slow or stop
the system. Other viruses are more dangerous. They can continually modify
or destroy data, intercept input/output devices, overwrite files and reformat
hard disks. </P>

<P><B>What Are The Symptoms Of Virus Infection?</B></P>

<P>Viruses remain free to proliferate only as long as they exist undetected.
Accordingly, the most common viruses give off no symptoms of their infection.
Anti-virus tools are necessary to identify these infections. However, many
viruses are flawed and do provide some tip-offs to their infection. Here
are some indications to watch for: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Changes in the length of programs </LI>

<LI>Changes in the file date or time stamp </LI>

<LI>Longer program load times </LI>

<LI>Slower system operation </LI>

<LI>Reduced memory or disk space </LI>

<LI>Bad sectors on your floppy </LI>

<LI>Unusual error messages </LI>

<LI>Unusual screen activity </LI>

<LI>Failed program execution </LI>

<LI>Failed system bootups when booting or accidentally booting from the
A: drive. </LI>

<LI>Unexpected writes to a drive. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>The Virus Threat: Common - And Growing</B></P>

<CENTER><P>How real is the threat from computer viruses? Every large corporation
and organization has experienced a virus infection - most experience them
monthly. According to data from IBM's High Integrity Computing Laboratory,
corporations with 1,000 PCs or more now experience a virus attack every
two to three months - and that frequency will likely double in a year.<BR>
<BR>
Actual And Projected Virus Infections Worldwide <BR>
<IMG SRC="epcorp1.gif" ALT="Graph 1" HEIGHT=289 WIDTH=350> </P></CENTER>

<P>The market research firm Dataquest concludes that virus infection is
growing exponentially. It found nearly two thirds (63%) of survey respondents
had experienced a virus incident (affecting 25 or fewer machines) at least
once, with nine percent reporting a disaster affecting more than 25 PCs.
</P>

<P>The 1993 Computer Crime Survey by Creative Strategies Research International
and BBS Systems of San Francisco found 64 percent of U.S. respondents had
experienced infection in 1993 alone. </P>

<P>If you have only recently become conscious of the computer virus epidemic,
you are not alone. Virus infections became a noticeable problem to computer
users only around 1990 - but it has grown rapidly since then. According
to a study by Certus International of 2,500 large U.S. sites with 400 or
more PCs, the rate of infection grew by 600 percent from 1990 to 1991.
</P>

<P><B>More Viruses Mean More Infections</B></P>

<CENTER><P>Virus infections are a growing problem, in part, because there
are more strains of viruses than ever before. In 1986, there were just
four PC viruses. New viruses were a rarity, with a virus strain created
once every three months. By 1989, a new virus appeared every week. By 1990,
the rate rose to once every two days. Now, more than three viruses are
created every day - for an average 110 new viruses created in a typical
month. From those modest four viruses in 1986, today's computer users face
thousands of virus strains.<BR>
<BR>
Number Of Unique Viruses <BR>
<IMG SRC="epcorp2.gif" ALT="Chart 2" HEIGHT=271 WIDTH=356> </P></CENTER>

<P>Here is the frightening part: Most infections today are caused by viruses
that are at least three years old. That is, the infections are caused by
viruses created no later than 1990, when there were approximately 300 known
viruses. Today, there are thousands of viruses. If that pattern of incubation
holds, the explosion of new viruses over the past few years could result
in another explosion in total infections over the next few years. </P>

<P><B>The History Of Viruses: How It All Began</B></P>

<P>Today, the existence of viruses and the need to protect against them
are inevitable realities. But it wasn't always so. As recently as the middle
1980s, computer viruses didn't exist. The first viruses were created in
university labs - to demonstrate the&quot;potential&quot; threat that such
software code could provide. By 1987, viruses began showing up at several
universities around the world. Three of the most common of today's viruses
- Stoned, Cascade and Friday the 13th - first appeared that year. </P>

<P>Serious outbreaks of some of these viruses began to appear over the
next two years. The Datacrime and Friday the 13th viruses became major
media events, presaging the concern that would later surround the Michelangelo
virus. Perhaps surprisingly, tiny Bulgaria became known as the world's
Virus Factory in 1990 because of the high number of viruses created there.
The NCSA found that Bulgaria, home of the notorious Dark Avenger, originated
76 viruses that year, making it the world's single largest virus contributor.
Analysts attribute Bulgaria's prolific virus output to an abundance of
trained but unemployed programmers; with nothing to do, these people tried
their hands at virus production, with unfortunately successful results.
</P>

<P>This growing activity convinced the computer industry that viruses were
serious threats requiring defensive action. IBM created its High Integrity
Computing Laboratory to lead Big Blue's anti-virus research effort. Symantec
began offering Symantec Anti-Virus, one of the first commercially available
virus defenses. These responses came none too soon. By 1991, the first
polymorphic viruses - that can, like the AIDS virus in humans, change their
shape to elude detection - began to spread and attack in significant numbers.
That year too, the total number of viruses began to swell, topping 1,000
for the first time. </P>

<P>Virus creation proliferated, and continues to accelerate, because of
the growing population of intelligent, computer-literate young people who
appreciate the challenge - but not the ethics - of writing and releasing
new viruses. Cultural factors also play a role. The U.S. - with its large
and growing population of computer-literate young people - is the second
largest source of infection. Elsewhere, Germany and Taiwan are the other
major contributors of new viruses. </P>

<P>Another reason for the rapid rise of new viruses is that virus creation
is getting easier. The same technology that makes it easier to create legitimate
software - Windows-based development tools, for example - is, unfortunately,
being applied to virus creation. The so-called Mutation Engine appeared
in 1992, facilitating the development of polymorphic viruses. In 1992,
the Virus Creation Laboratory, featuring on-line help and pull-down menus,
brought virus creation within the reach of even non-sophisticated computer
users. </P>

<P><B>More PCs And Networks Mean More Infections, Too</B></P>

<P>The growing number of PCs, PC-based networks and businesses relying
on PCs are another set of reasons for rising infections: there are more
potential victims. For example, in the decade since the invention and popularization
of the PC, the installed base of active PCs grew to 54 million by 1990.
But that number has already more than doubled (to 112 million PCs in 1993)
and will climb to 134 million PCs by 1994. </P>

<P>Not only are PCs becoming more common - they are taking over a rising
share of corporate computing duties. A range of networking technologies
- including Novell NetWare, Microsoft Windows NT and LAN Manager, LAN Server,
OS/2 and Banyan VINES - are allowing companies to downsize from mainframe-based
computer systems to PC-based LANs and, now, client-server systems. These
systems are more cost-effective and they are being deployed more broadly
within organizations for a growing range of mission-critical applications,
from finance and sales data to inventory control, purchasing and manufacturing
process control. </P>

<P>The current, rapid adoption of client-server computing by business gives
viruses fertile new ground for infection. These server-based solutions
are precisely the type of computers that are susceptible - if unprotected
- to most computer viruses. And because data exchange is the very reason
for using client-server solutions, a virus on one PC in the enterprise
is far more likely to communicate with - and infect - more PCs and servers
than would have been true a few years ago. </P>

<P>Moreover, client-server computing is putting PCs in the hands of many
first-time or relatively inexperienced computer users, who are less likely
to understand the virus problem. The increased use of portable PCs, remote
link-ups to servers and inter-organization-and inter-network e-mail all
add to the risk of infections, too. Once a virus infects a single networked
computer, the average time required to infect another workstation is from
10 to 20 minutes - meaning a virus can paralyze an entire enterprise in
a few hours. </P>

<P><B>What Is Ahead?</B></P>

<P>The industry's latest buzz-phrase is &quot;data superhighway&quot; and,
although most people haven't thought about those superhighways in the context
of virus infections, they should. Any technology that increases communication
among computers also increases the likelihood of infection. And the data
superhighway promises to expand on today's Internet links with high-bandwidth
transmission of dense digital video, voice and data traffic at increasingly
cost-effective rates. Corporations, universities, government agencies,
non-profit organizations and consumers will be exchanging far more data
than ever before. That makes virus protection more important, as well.
</P>

<P>In addition to more opportunities for infection, there'll be more and
more-damaging strains of virus to do the infecting. Regardless of the exact
number of viruses that appear in the next few years, the Mutation Engine,
Virus Creation Laboratory and other virus construction kits are sure to
boost the virus population. Viruses that combine the worst features of
several virus types - such as polymorphic boot sector viruses - are appearing
and will become more common. Already, Windows-specific viruses have appeared.
Virus writers, and their creations, are getting smarter. In response to
the explosion in virus types and opportunities for transmission, virus
protection will have to expand, too. </P>

<P><B>The Costs Of Virus Infection</B></P>

<P>Computer viruses have cost companies worldwide nearly two billion dollars
since 1990, with those costs accelerating, according to an analysis of
survey data from IBM's High Integrity Computing Laboratory and Dataquest.
Global viral costs are projected to climb another 1.9 billion dollars in
1994 alone. <I>2</I></P>

<CENTER><P>The Cost Of Virus Infections <BR>
<IMG SRC="epcorp3.gif" ALT="chart 3" HEIGHT=371 WIDTH=343><BR CLEAR=all>
</P></CENTER>

<P>The costs are so high because of the direct labor expense of cleanup
for all infected hard disks and floppies in a typical incident. The indirect
expense of lost productivity - an enormous sum - is higher, still. In a
typical infection at a large corporate site, technical support personnel
will have to inspect all 1,000 PCs. Since each PC user has an average 35
diskettes, about 35,000 diskettes will have to be scanned, too. </P>

<CENTER><P>Recovery Time For A Virus Disaster (25 PCs)<BR>
<IMG SRC="epcorp4.gif" ALT="chart 4" HEIGHT=328 WIDTH=359><BR CLEAR=all>
On average, it took North American respondents to the 1991 Dataquest study
four days to recover from a virus episode - and some MIS managers needed
fully 30 days to recover. Even more ominously, their efforts were not wholly
effective; a single infected floppy disk taken home during cleanup and
later returned to the office can trigger a relapse. Some 25 percent of
those experiencing a virus attack later suffered such a re-infection by
the same virus within 30 days.</P></CENTER>

<P>That cleanup is costing each of these corporations an average $177,000
in 1993 - and that sum will grow to more than $254,000 in 1994. If you're
in an enterprise with 1,000 or more PCs, you can use these figures to estimate
your own virus-fighting costs. Take the cost-per-PC ($177 in 1993, $254
in 1994) and multiply it by the number of PCs in your organization. </P>

<P>At a briefing before the U.S. Congress in 1993, NYNEX, one of North
America's largest telecommunications companies, described its experience
with virus infections </P>

<UL>
<LI>Since late 1989, the company had nearly 50 reported virus incidents
- and believes it experienced another 50 unreported incidents. </LI>

<LI>The single user, single PC virus incident is the exception. More typical
incidents involved 17 PCs and 50 disks at a time. In the case of a 3Com
network, the visible signs of infection did not materialize until after
17 PCs were infected. The LAN was down for a week while the cleanup was
conducted. </LI>

<LI>Even the costs of dealing with a so-called benign virus are high. A
relatively innocuous Jerusalem-B virus had infected 10 executable files
on a single system. Because the computer was connected to a token ring
network, all computers in that domain had to be scanned for the virus.
Four LAN administrators spent two days plus overtime, one technician spent
nine hours, a security specialist spent five hours, and most of the 200
PC on the LAN had to endure 15-minute interruptions throughout a two-day
period. </LI>
</UL>

<P>In the October 1993 issue of Virus Bulletin, Micki Krause, Program Manager
for Information Security at Rockwell International, outlined the cost of
a recent virus outbreak at her corporation:<I>3</I></P>

<LI>In late April 1993, the Hi virus was discovered at a large division
of Rockwell located in the U.S. The division is heavily networked with
nine file servers and 630 client PCs. The site is also connected to 64
other sites around the world (more than half of which are outside the U.S.).
The virus had entered the division on program disks from a legitimate European
business partner. One day after the disks arrived, the Hi virus was found
by technicians on file servers, PCs and floppy disks. Despite eradication
efforts, the virus continued to infect the network throughout the entire
month of May. </LI>

<LI>160 hours were spent by internal PC and LAN support personnel to identify
and contain the infections. At $45.00 per hour, their efforts cost Rockwell
$7,200. </LI>

<LI>Rockwell also hired an external consultant to assist Rockwell employees
in the cleanup. 200 hours were spent by the consultant, resulting in a
cost of $8,000. </LI>

<LI>One file server was disconnected from the LAN to prevent the virus
from further propagating across the network. The server, used by approximately
100 employees, was down for an entire day. Rockwell estimated the cost
of the downtime at $9,000 (100 users @ $45/hr for 8 hours, with users accessing
the server, on average, 25% of the normal workday). </LI>

<LI>While some anti-virus software was in use, Rockwell purchased additional
software for use on both the servers and the client PCs for an additional
$19,800. </LI>

<LI>Total Cost of the virus incident at Rockwell was $44,000. </LI>

<H4>Technical Overview</H4>

<P><B>Computer Viruses And How They Work</B></P>

<P>Viruses are small software programs. At the very least, to be a virus,
these programs must replicate themselves. They do this by exploiting computer
code, already on the host system. The virus can infect, or become resident
in almost any software component, including an application, operating system,
system boot code or device driver. Viruses gain control over their host
in various ways. Here is a closer look at the major virus types, how they
function, and how you can fight them. </P>

<P><B>File Viruses</B></P>

<P>Most of the thousands of viruses known to exist are file viruses, including
the Friday the 13th virus. They infect files by attaching themselves to
a file, generally an executable file - the .EXE and .COM files that control
applications and programs. The virus can insert its own code in any part
of the file, provided it changes the hosts code, somewhere along the way,
misdirecting proper program execution so that it executes the virus code
first, rather than to the legitimate program. When the file is executed,
the virus is executed first. </P>

<P>Most file viruses store themselves in memory. There, they can easily
monitor access calls to infect other programs as they're executed. A simple
file virus will overwrite and destroy a host file, immediately alerting
the user to a problem because the software will not run. Because these
viruses are immediately felt, they have less opportunity to spread. More
pernicious file viruses cause more subtle or delayed damage - and spread
considerably before being detected. </P>

<P>As users move to increasingly networked and client-server environments,
file viruses are becoming more common. The challenge for users is to detect
and clean this virus from memory, without having to reboot from a clean
diskette. That task is complicated because file viruses can quickly infect
a range of software components throughout a user's system. Also, the scan
technique used to detect viruses can cause further infections; scans open
files and file viruses can infect a file during that operation. File viruses
such as the Hundred Years virus can infect data files too. </P>

<P><B>Boot Sector/partition table viruses</B></P>

<P>While there are only about 200 different boot sector viruses, they make
up 75 percent of all virus infections. Boot sector viruses include Stoned,
the most common virus of all time, and Michelangelo, perhaps the most notorious.
These viruses are so prevalent because they are harder to detect, as they
do not change a files size or slow performance, and are fairly invisible
until their trigger event occurs - such as the reformatting of a hard disk.
They also spread rapidly. </P>

<P>The boot sector virus infects floppy disks and hard disks by inserting
itself into the boot sector of the disk, which contains code that's executed
during the system boot process. Booting from an infected floppy allows
the virus to jump to the computer's hard disk. The virus executes first
and gains control of the system boot even before MS-DOS is loaded. Because
the virus executes before the operating system is loaded, it is not MS-DOS-specific
and can infect any PC operating system platform - MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2,
PC-NFS, or Windows NT. </P>

<P>The virus goes into RAM, and infects every disk that is accessed until
the computer is rebooted and the virus is removed from memory. Because
these viruses are memory resident, they can be detected by running CHKDSK
to view the amount of RAM and observe if the expected total has declined
by a few kilobytes. Partition table viruses attack the hard disk partition
table by moving it to a different sector and replacing the original partition
table with its own infectious code. These viruses spread from the partition
table to the boot sector of floppy disks as floppies are accessed. </P>

<P><B>Multi-Partite Viruses</B></P>

<P>These viruses combine the ugliest features of both file and boot sector/partition
table viruses. They can infect any of these host software components. And
while traditional boot sector viruses spread only from infected floppy
boot disks, multi-partite viruses can spread with the ease of a file virus
- but still insert an infection into a boot sector or partition table.
This makes them particularly difficult to eradicate. Tequila is an example
of a multi-partite virus. </P>

<P><B>Trojan Horses.</B></P>

<P>Like its classical namesake, the Trojan Horse virus typically masquerades
as something desirable - e.g., a legitimate software program. The Trojan
Horse generally does not replicate (although researchers have discovered
replicating Trojan Horses). It waits until its trigger event and then displays
a message or destroys files or disks. Because it generally does not replicate,
some researchers do not classify Trojan Horses as viruses - but that is
of little comfort to the victims of these malicious stains of software.
</P>

<P><B>File Overwriters</B></P>

<P>These viruses infect files by linking themselves to a program, keeping
the original code intact and adding themselves to as many files as possible.
Innocuous versions of file overwriters may not be intended to do anything
more than replicate but, even then, they take up space and slow performance.
And since file overwriters, like most other viruses, are often flawed,
they can damage or destroy files inadvertently. The worst file overwriters
remain hidden only until their trigger events. Then, they can deliberately
destroy files and disks. </P>

<P><B>Polymorphic viruses</B></P>

<P>More and more of today's viruses are polymorphic in nature. The recently
released Mutation Engine - which makes it easy for virus creators to transform
simple viruses into polymorphic ones - ensures that polymorphic viruses
will only proliferate over the next few years. Like the human AIDS virus
that mutates frequently to escape detection by the body's defenses, the
polymorphic computer virus likewise mutates to escape detection by anti-virus
software that compares it to an inventory of known viruses. Code within
the virus includes an encryption routine to help the virus hide from detection,
plus a decryption routine to restore the virus to its original state when
it executes. Polymorphic viruses can infect any type of host software;
although polymorphic file viruses are most common, polymorphic boot sector
viruses have already been discovered. </P>

<P>Some polymorphic viruses have a relatively limited number of variants
or disguises, making them easier to identify. The Whale virus, for example,
has 32 forms. Anti-virus tools can detect these viruses by comparing them
to an inventory of virus descriptions that allows for wildcard variations
- much as PC users can search for half-remembered files in a directory
by typing the first few letters plus an asterisk symbol. Polymorphic viruses
derived from tools such as the Mutation Engine are tougher to identify,
because they can take any of four billion forms. </P>

<P><B>Stealth Viruses</B></P>

<P>Stealth aircraft have special engineering that enables them to elude
detection by normal radar. Stealth viruses have special engineering that
enables them to elude detection by traditional anti-virus tools. The stealth
virus adds itself to a file or boot sector but, when you examine the host
software, it appears normal and unchanged. The stealth virus performs this
trickery by lurking in memory when it's executed. There, it monitors and
intercepts your system's MS-DOS calls. When the system seeks to open an
infected file, the stealth virus races ahead, uninfects the file and allows
MS-DOS to open it - all appears normal. When MS-DOS closes the file, the
virus reverses these actions, reinfecting the file. </P>

<P>Boot sector stealth viruses insinuate themselves in the system's boot
sector and relocate the legitimate boot sector code to another part of
the disk. When the system is booted, they retrieve the legitimate code
and pass it along to accomplish the boot. When you examine the boot sector,
it appears normal - but you are not seeing the boot sector in its normal
location. Stealth viruses take up space, slow system performance, and can
inadvertently or deliberately destroy data and files. Some anti-virus scanners,
using traditional anti-virus techniques, can actually spread the virus.
That is because they open and close files to scan them - and those acts
give the virus additional chances to propagate. These same scanners will
also fail to detect stealth viruses, because the act of opening the file
for the scan causes the virus to temporarily disinfect the file, making
it appear normal. </P>

<P><B>Anti-Virus Tools And Techniques</B></P>

<P>Anti-virus software tools can use any of a growing arsenal of weapons
to detect and fight viruses, including active signature-based scanning,
resident monitoring, checksum comparisons and generic expert systems. Each
of these tools has its specific strengths and weaknesses. An anti-virus
strategy that uses only one or two of the following techniques can leave
you vulnerable to viruses designed to elude specific defenses. An anti-virus
strategy that uses all of these techniques provides a comprehensive shield
and the best possible defense against infection. </P>

<P><B>Signature-Based Scanners</B></P>

<P>Scanners - which, when activated, examine every file on a specified
drive - can use any of a variety of anti-virus techniques. The most common
is signature-based analysis. Signatures are the fingerprints of computer
viruses - distinct strands of code that are unique to a single virus, much
as DNA strands would be unique to a biological virus. Viruses, therefore,
can be identified by their signatures. Virus researchers and anti-virus
product developers catalog known viruses and their signatures, and signature-based
scanners use these catalogs to search for viruses on a user's system. The
best scanners have an exhaustive inventory of all viruses now known to
exist. The signature-based scanner examines all possible locations for
infection - boot sectors, system memory, partition tables and files - looking
for strings of code that match the virus signatures stored in its memory.
</P>

<P>When the scanner identifies a signature match, it can identify the virus
by name and indicate where on the hard disk or floppy disk the infection
is located. Because the signature-based scanner offers a precise identification
of known viruses, it can offer the best method for effective and complete
removal. The scanner can also detect the virus before it has had a chance
to run, reducing the chance that the infection will spread before detection.
Against these benefits, the signature-based scanner has limitations. At
best, it can only detect viruses for which it is programmed with a signature.
It cannot detect so-called unknown viruses - those that have not been previously
discovered, analyzed and recorded in the files of anti-virus software.
Polymorphic viruses elude detection by altering the code string that the
scanner is searching for; to identify these viruses, you need another technique.
</P>

<P>Stealth viruses can elude detection by scanners by removing their tell-tale
traces when the file is opened for the operation of the scan. To detect
them, a scanner must include an anti-stealth defense that monitors MS-DOS
calls at a very low level as the scan is underway. When it sees other code
intercepting open/close calls, the anti-stealth defense suspects an unknown
stealth virus is at work. It then rescans the file in question while it
is closed - and after it has been re-infected. If the result of the two
scans is different, the anti-virus software alerts the user to the virus
activity. Another drawback of signature-based scanners is their inherent
inability to stay current on virus detection. They offer no protection
against viruses discovered after their inventory of signatures is assembled.
Periodic update files are available but these will offer a lag between
the time a virus could infect your system and the time you'll receive the
update. You must continually install updates on all of your systems - and
run the risk that individual users may fail to use them properly. </P>

<P><B>Terminate-And-Stay-Resident (TSR) Monitoring</B></P>

<P>Virus scanners generally operate in batch mode, scanning all the files
on a system, hard disk or floppy disk, when requested by the user. TSR
monitors, on the other hand, operate like other TSR programs, that is,
in the background, while other programs are running. Anti-virus TSR programs
can provide any combination of protective activities, including real-time
monitoring of disks and files, expert system analysis of virus-like behavior
and code, and stealth- and polymorphic-specific detection. </P>

<P>The advantage of TSR-based virus protection is its automatic nature.
Users, especially less-experienced users, do not need to activate the software
or remember to run it. That makes it more convenient and more useful, since
it is always operating. TSR monitors protect systems invisibly, continuously,
without user intervention. </P>

<P>However, every technique has its weaknesses. The full-time, automatic
nature of anti-virus TSRs can also be a problem. They can take up scarce
memory space needed for other TSRs or software. They can cause false alarms
triggered by over-reactions to normal disk writes and the unconventional
techniques of backup, data compression and sector editing software. Beyond
being annoying, false alarms can lead some users to deactivate the TSR,
reducing protection. </P>

<P><B>Multi-Level Generic Detection</B></P>

<P>Signature-based detection is useful against known viruses, for which
tell-tale signature code can be identified and stored for comparison with
suspect code. But it cannot detect unknown viruses. Multi-level generic
detection fills this gap. The technique is, as the name suggests, a combination
of defenses, including checksum comparison, intelligent checksum analysis
and cleaning, and expert system virus analysis. These tools meet the need
to detect unknown viruses. Together with signature-based analysis, these
tools produce the highest available detection of known and unknown viruses,
the least false alarms, and the lowest risk of additional contamination
during anti-virus activity. </P>

<P>Checksum comparison is based on comparing the current checksums of a
suspect file or disk to checksums recorded when the system was in a known,
clean state. Checksums are the fingerprints of a file - a unique representation
of a file's bit sequence. The checksum is created by an algorithm that
reads a file's bytes sequentially, essentially creating a unique numeric
code that represents the file. Any subsequent change to the file will produce
a change in the checksum calculation. Comparing two checksums of the same
file at different times can flag file changes caused by a virus. </P>

<P>Intelligent checksum analysis and cleaning improves upon traditional
checksum comparisons in three ways. First, it distinguishes between legitimate
changes to a file and those that might be caused by a virus, thanks to
additional algorithms that can recognize file writes, for example, updating
a device driver. It works to understand when and why the file was changed,
leading to greater accuracy in distinguishing viruses from legitimate file
changes. Second, it includes generic cleaning as well as generic detection.
It can disinfect files, restoring them to their original condition; traditional
checksums can only detect viruses. Third, it provides better security against
viruses that specifically target anti-virus software. Together, these advances
increase scanning speed, provide better and faster detection and cleaning
against unknown viruses, and reduce the need for frequent updates. </P>

<P>Expert system virus analysis adds two major benefits to the virus protection
mix: it can locate previously unknown viruses (i.e., viruses without recorded
signatures) and it can identify those viruses - as well as known viruses
- without having any previous system information to use for comparison.
The expert system is superior to checksum-based generic anti-virus technology
that may be triggered by non-virus file changes. It detects a higher percentage
of boot sector viruses without using signature checking. </P>

<P>An expert system is a series of proprietary algorithms that performs
millions of tests on your system's software, examining the code flows,
calls and executions, and other software functions. It assigns a number
of points to the software based on the results of each of these tests,
and identifies a virus on the basis of these point scores. Unlike rules-based
approaches, the best expert system does not execute code in order to analyze
it; it can analyze unopened files and identify virus code. As a result,
the expert system avoids the risk of additional system infection associated
with opening files that may contain stealth viruses. As mentioned earlier,
polymorphic viruses created with a virus construction toolkit such as the
Mutation Engine can assume any of up to four billion forms. The best anti-virus
products include an expert system that can identify and clean these viruses.
First, it must perform thousands or millions of tests on suspect code to
determine the presence of a virus. Then, it runs tests to identify the
virus' decryption code and decrypt the virus. In its true state, the virus
can be positively identified if it is listed in the inventory of the anti-virus
software. The expert system algorithms detect and save the virus - specific
decryption code, so they can then use this code to retrieve the original
file information and restore or clean the host file to its original condition.

<HR><I>1. The Computer Virus Market Survey was conducted by Dataquest in
October 1991 for the National Computer Security Association. 602 respondents
completed the phone survey. They were selected from a list of sites with
300 or more PCs. 62 percent of respondents were responsible for the security
of PCs for their entire organizations, with the number of PCs averaging
1,027. The survey included U.S. and Canadian corporations and government
agencies. </I></P>
