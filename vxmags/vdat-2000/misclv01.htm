<p>A destructive computer worm swept several continents Thursday, touching tens 
  of thousands of individual users as well as the Central Intelligence Agency, 
  Ford Motor Co. and Britain's Parliament. <br>
  Over a five-hour period the worm spread across Asia, Europe and the United States 
  via e-mail messages titled &quot;ILOVEYOU.&quot; The menace clogged Web servers, 
  overwrote personal files and caused corporate IT managers to shut down e-mail 
  systems.</p>
<p>The FBI said Thursday it was investigating the so-called &quot;Love Bug&quot; 
  virus. FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman said the investigation, coordinated by 
  the agency's National Infrastructure Protection Center, would try to determine 
  whether there have been any violations of the federal Computer Abuse Act.</p>
<p>A scan of the Visual Basic code included in the attachment reveals that the 
  virus may be corrupting MP3 and JPEG files on users' hard drives, as well as 
  mIRC, a version of Internet Relay Chat. It also appears to reset the default 
  start page for Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The attack may have originated in the Philippines. Sky Internet Inc., the Quezon 
  City, Philippines, Internet service provider that inadvertently hosted some 
  of the &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; worm code, said Thursday that the company is hunting 
  the writer. </p>
<p>Numerous corporations have reported problems with the bug, and several have 
  shut down e-mail servers to prevent it spreading and to implement fixes. </p>
<p> Sources at San Francisco-based Pacific Bell said the company shut down its 
  e-mail servers to stop the bug's spread. A company spokeswoman said &quot;there's 
  been no significant impact for any Pacific Bell company,&quot; but she didn't 
  know the extent of the infection.</p>
<p> A Pentagon office that compiles news clippings sent the &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; 
  message to all recipients on its mailing list, including contacts at the Central 
  Intelligence Agency, Civil Air Patrol, General Accounting Office, military commands 
  and the National Infrastructure Protection Center.</p>
<p> The British Parliament was also said to be affected, with the House of Commons 
  shutting down its e-mail system for about two hours on Thursday to safeguard 
  against the virus.</p>
<p> Ford Motor Co. said it shut down its e-mail system, serving more than 100,000 
  employees worldwide, this morning after the virus infiltrated its system in 
  Europe.</p>
<p> In New York, a spokeswoman for brokerage house Merrill Lynch confirmed the 
  company had been infected with the virus, saying it was &quot;currently being 
  eradicated and has had no impact on the business.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Spreading quickly</b></p>
<p> Virus hunters say the bug has spread quickly, particularly when compared with 
  previous infections.</p>
<p>When a user running the e-mail program Microsoft Outlook clicks on the attachment, 
  the virus sends a copy of itself to every person in his or her address book.</p>
<p>A Microsoft security spokeswoman told ZDNet News the company currently has 
  no plans to issue a patch or security warning to its customers. Instead, Microsoft 
  is simply reminding its users to &quot;continue to follow best security practices, 
  such as to be leery of dubious e-mail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a virus. The anti-virus companies are the experts here,&quot; 
  the spokeswoman said. &quot;We are working closely with the anti-virus community 
  to provide them with any information we can.&quot; She added that, right now, 
  Microsoft has no plans to temporarily shut down its own internal mail servers 
  -- something the company did to halt the <a href="specialc.htm#MEL">proliferation 
  of the Melissa virus last year</a>.</p>
<p><b>Melissa was limited; 'Love' bug isn't</b></p>
<p> &quot;Melissa was limited to 50 (addresses). That's the big reason why we 
  think it's been spreading so fast,&quot; said Narender Mangalam, director of 
  security strategy at Computer Associates.</p>
<p>The good news is that the huge publicity generated by Melissa seems to have 
  made computer users and corporations far more alert to the problems of viruses.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction times (are much faster) compared to a year ago with Melissa. 
  Last year we were talking days for some to react. Now we're talking almost minutes 
  to react,&quot; said Vincent Weafer director of the Symantec AntiVirus Research 
  Center.</p>
<p>And that helped limit the damage somewhat caused so far.</p>
<p> &quot;There's less of an impact in terms of actually bringing down (e-mail 
  servers), but the footprint is much larger,&quot; said Computer Associates' 
  Mangalam. &quot;Our UK division says that almost 15 percent of business are 
  affected. We haven't seen one that goes out that far since Melissa.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Not restricted to Outlook</b></p>
<p> But users should be aware that the damage is not limited to simple propagation, 
  nor is it restricted to Outlook users.</p>
<p>Once activated, the virus will attempt to rename files with the following extensions: 
  MP3, JPEG, VPOS, JS, JSE, CSS, WSH, SCT and HTA.</p>
<p>It also attempts to spread itself via Internet Relay Chat and tries to access 
  files located on the Web.</p>
<p>&quot;It tries to go up to four separate Web sites and bring down code that 
  can obviously allow the guys who own the Web site access to the (users) computer. 
  But the Web sites seem to be down. There's no immediate danger,&quot; Mangalam 
  said.</p>
<p>Symantec said it has reports of more than 1,000 infections. The bug, which 
  the company called VBS.LoveLetter.A, uses Microsoft Outlook to replicate itself, 
  sending messages with the message &quot;kindly check the attached LOVELETTER 
  coming from me.&quot; </p>
<p>The name of the attachment is &quot;LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs.&quot; </p>
<p>Once the attachment is opened, the worm replicates itself and adds several 
  files to the user's computer. </p>
<p><b>Origin in the Philippines</b></p>
<p> The file may have originated from a user dubbed &quot;spyder&quot; in the 
  Philippines. The text of the virus script also contains the phrase &quot;i hate 
  to go to school.&quot; </p>
<p>Sky Internet Inc., the ISP that inadvertently hosted some of the &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; 
  worm code, said on Thursday that the company is hunting the writer. </p>
<p>According to Ronald Eociario, a system administrator for the ISP, the four 
  Web pages that acted as remote download sites for the worm have been shut down, 
  and the company has traced back the source of those accounts to another hosting 
  provider in the Philippines. </p>
<p>&quot;Our service was used as a gateway,&quot; said Eociario. &quot;We already 
  have pinpointed the suspect. They are within the Philippines, but we are not 
  sure whether they are host.&quot; </p>
<p>Melissa brought worldwide attention to the problems of computer viruses when 
  it struck e-mail systems in March 1999. The program knocked out e-mail servers 
  at dozens of corporations and is estimated to have caused millions of dollars' 
  worth of damage. </p>
<p>David L. Smith, <a href="specialc.htm#MEL">the alleged author of the Melissa 
  virus</a>, was recently arraigned in a New Jersey court on charges of interruption 
  to public communications, conspiracy to commit the offense and attempt to commit 
  the offense.</p>
