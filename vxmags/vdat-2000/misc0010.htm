<TD>Where were you in January of 1986?
<P>I remember exactly where I was on January 28. I was driving a truck
up the California coast, delivering pet supplies to pet shops. I had stopped
briefly in Nipomo and was watching television with the store owner. We
watched as Challenger lifted off from Cape Canaveral and exploded. </P>

<P>My computer experience at the time was limited to programming assembly
language on a Z80 and a Commodore 128. I didn't get a PC until I started
an online research service in 1987. </P>

full-stealth capability. </P>

<P>In December of 1986, a file infecting demo virus was introduced. It
was called Virdem and was created in Germany. </P>

<P>In October of 1987, Brain was discovered in the wild, at the University

<P>Other viruses were first discovered in 1987 at Universities around the
world. In November, the <B><I>Lehigh Virus</I></B> was discovered at Lehigh
University in the United States. The virus only infected Command.com. Since
Command.com remains resident, this was technically the first memory resident
file infector. </P>

<P>In December, the <B><I>Jerusalem virus</I></B>, appeared at the Hebrew
University of Israel. It was the first file infector designed to go memory-resident.
It is possible that Jerusalem was the fourth in a series of viruses by
the same author. The other three were the Suriv variants 1, 2, and 3. (Suriv
is Virus spelled backwards). These however came to light after Jerusalem
did. Jerusalem was also the first virus discovered that infected programs
with either .COM or .EXE extensions (and the first to contain a bug which
causes it to re-infect already infected programs). </P>

<P>Reportedly, around this time, <B><I>Stoned</I></B> (the first MBR infector)
was written by a student at the University of Wellington in New Zealand
and the <B><I>Vienna Virus</I></B> was written by an Austrian high school
student. </P>

<P>In 1987 a book was released with a disassembly of the Vienna virus.
Also in that book was source code for other viruses, including the Burger
and Number One viruses. </P>

<P>The <B><I>Den Zuk</I></B> viruses (two versions) were created in March
by Denny Yanuar Ramdhani in Bandung, Indonesia. The virus will detect and
remove the Brain virus. It also immunizes the disk against Brain infection.
This was evidently the first anti-virus virus. (A letter from the virus's
creator was published in the Virus Bulletin of February, 1991) </P>

<P>The <B><I>Cascade Virus</I></B> is found in Germany. It is a memory-resident
virus and introduced self-encryption using a random key. Cascade was evidently
the first encrypted virus. </P>

<P>By the time I examined my first virus on August 16, 1989, there were
about 30 known viruses. Until then I had only read about them. I had been
writing security and copy protection programs in assembler at the time
and had made a program to detect viruses and Trojans. I ran it on the virus
(Jerusalem.1808.Standard) and several alarms sounded. Today the program
would be called a heuristic scanner. It had very limited distribution on
a couple of local BBS's and a total of one registered user. </P>

<P>Not long after I got the virus, that one registered user (Rick Mendosa)
offered me a job at a business magazine where I became the research editor.
One day soon after that he handed me a clipping about a virus that people
thought would soon wreak havoc on civilization. </P>

<P><B>DataCrime</B> </P>

<P>The Washington Post of September 17, 1989 reported, under the headline
&quot;Computer Virus Sparks a User Scare; Some Analysts Say the 'Friday
the 13th' Fears Are Overblown&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;A computer 'virus' that springs to life destructively on Friday
the 13th is on the loose, and across the country computer users are rushing
helter-skelter to protect their machines against it.&quot; </P>

<P>There was actually some confusion in the flurry of news reports and
quoted &quot;experts&quot;. Actually two viruses were being described in
the reports. One was <B><I>DataCrime</I></B>, which would trigger any day
after October 12th. The other was Jerusalem, which triggers on any Friday
the 13th. And this October 13th was on a Friday. </P>

<P>Here are some other headlines from other stories about DataCrime from
this period: </P>

</UL>

<P><B>Dark Avenger</B> </P>

<P>Yet, although DataCrime was blown all out of proportion, several important
viruses did first appear during 1989. One in particular was mentioned in
the headline: </P>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;'Dark Avenger' wreaks havoc at software firm&quot; - PC Week,
December 25, 1989 </LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B><I>Dark Avenger.1800 virus</I></B>, unlike DataCrime, actually
could represent a threat worldwide. The virus was reportedly written in
Sophia, Bulgaria in January of 1989, by an individual calling himself Dark
Avenger. It well represented the coming escalation in the virus vs. anti-virus
war. </P>

<P>This virus introduced two worrisome features. </P>

<P>First, it was designed to do slow, insidious damage to the system rather
than sudden obvious damage. It would randomly write garbage to sectors
of the drive. So damage would tend to go unnoticed. In turn damaged files
would be backed up. </P>

<P>Second, it was a fast-infector. Resident viruses before this would infect
programs as they were run. Dark Avenger also infects programs if they are
opened. Therefore, if the virus was in memory and you ran an anti-virus
scanner (that wasn't aware of the virus) on the system, the virus would
piggyback on the scanner and infect every program the scanner looked at.
</P>

<P><B>Frodo Lives</B> </P>

<P>In October of 1989, another important virus was discovered in Haifa,
Israel. This was the <B><I>Frodo virus</I></B>. Frodo was the first full-stealth
file infector. It was designed to damage the hard disk if run on or after
September 22 of any year. However, in all reported samples of the virus
the damage routine is corrupted and Frodo simply hangs the system. </P>

<P>Frodo got its press coverage the following year with the headline: </P>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;Computer Virus Is Due to Strike Today, Expert Warns&quot; - Los
Angeles Times, September 22, 1990 (From Reuters) </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Et cetera</B> </P>

<P>Other interesting viruses in 1989 were: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Alabama virus discovered in Israel. </LI>

<LI>Amstrad virus reportedly published in a magazine. </LI>

<LI>DBase virus reported by Ross Greenberg. </LI>

<LI>Do Nothing virus on BBS's in Israel. </LI>

<LI>Trackswap virus. With text: &quot;(C) June, by the CIA.&quot; </LI>

<LI>Vacsina (and later Yankee Doodle) viruses. </LI>

<LI>Zerobug virus. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Research and Development</B> </P>

<P>A few months before I got my first virus, Steve White organized the
High Integrity Computing Laboratory at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center. About the same time, IBM released its first antivirus product.
</P>

<P>One month before I got my first virus, a journal called <A HREF="http://www.virusbtn.com">Virus
Bulletin</A> began. It was and is an excellent source of accurate, timely
information on viruses. </P>

<P>In retrospect, it seems that many seeds sprouted around this time that
grew into today's antivirus industry. For example, in these early days
before 1990, most of today's top antivirus professionals got started. </P>

<P>Among these are: </P>

<P>Bill Arnold, Tjark Auerbach, Pavel Baudis, Vesselin Bontchev, David
Chess, Paul Ducklin, Richard Ford, Ray Glath, Ross Greenberg, Dmitry Gryaznov,
Jan Hruska, Eugene Kaspersky, Jeff Kephart, Mike Lambert, Igor Muttik,
Roger Riordan, Fridrik Skulason, Alan Solomon, Wolfgang Stiller, Morton
Swimmer, Roger Thompson, Frans Veldman, Joe Wells, Steve White, and Righard

<LI>Windows 3.0 </LI>

<LI>(Hardware) 80486 released. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Have you ever seen a Stealth, Polymorphic, Armored, Multipartite virus?
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Stealth is a mechanism by which a virus hides size increase and/or
its own code. </LI>

<LI>Polymorphism involves encrypted viruses where the decryption routine
code is variable. </LI>

<LI>Armoring is used to prevent anti-virus researchers from disassembling
a virus. </LI>

<LI>Multipartite is a virus that can infect both programs and boot sectors.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Well, 1990 was the year of mix and match. Demo viruses from two separate
researchers in the United States introduced advanced polymorphism as well
as armoring (these were the V2Px viruses, Virus-90 and Virus-101). The
Fish virus was full stealth and encrypted with a very short decryptor (14
bytes). Joshi took boot sector stealthing to new levels. </P>

<P>The title of &quot;first successful multipartite virus&quot; should
probably go to the <B><I>Flip virus</I></B> (which is also polymorphic).
There were however two multipartite viruses that probably predate Flip.
They were Anthrax and V1, but neither was very successful. </P>

<P>Then we found out what armor really was. A new virus appeared that was
more armored than a M1A1 Abrams tank. </P>

<P><B>The Mother of all Viruses</B> </P>

<P>I was still a magazine editor in 1990. I asked a well known anti-virus
developer about a new virus and he predicted some degree of doom and gloom.
Good thing I never published his prediction. It was the Whale virus, and
a better description of its effectiveness was given at a virus conference
in early 1991. There, Steve White of IBM said that he could gave the Whale
virus to everyone in the audience and it still wouldn't spread. </P>

<P>While there was not much frenzy in the press about Whale, there was
way too much paper and ink wasted on it in the anti-virus industry. Even
more time was wasted by anti-virus researchers. </P>

<P><B>VxBBS</B> </P>

<P>During 1990, a new threat arose in the form of virus exchange BBS's.
These boards had huge virus collections for download. But to download viruses,
the user had to upload viruses first. This resulted in hundreds of viruses
being created just for upload. Moreover, many hacked viruses, non-viruses,
attempts at viruses, and completely innocent programs were being uploaded.
In turn, these unwieldy conglomerate masses made their way into antivirus
research collections. Worse still, such horrific &quot;test collections&quot;
fell into the hands of product reviewers. (During 1992, one of these sets
was sold in the United States for $100.) </P>

<P><B>Anti-Virus Products</B> </P>

<P>By the end of 1990 there were a number of anti-virus products available.
While researching this timeline, I found a list of scanners I was going
to test for a magazine review. The list is dated December 18, 1990. The
products I had for testing were: </P>

<UL>
<LI>AntiVirus Plus from Iris </LI>

<LI>Certus from Certus International </LI>

<LI>Data Physician from Digital Dispatch </LI>

<LI>Turbo Antivirus from Carmel </LI>

<LI>Virex-PC from Microcom </LI>

<LI>Virucide (McAfee's Pro-Scan) from Parsons </LI>

<LI>Virusafe from EliaShim </LI>

<LI>ViruScan from McAfee </LI>
</UL>

<P>At the time, I felt this list was fairly complete. It isn't. Other anti-virus
scanners from 1990 include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit from S&amp;S </LI>

<LI>F-Prot from Frisk Software </LI>

<LI>ThunderByte from ESaSS </LI>

<LI>Vet from Cybec </LI>

<LI>VirusBuster from Hunix </LI>

<LI>Virscan from IBM </LI>

<LI>Vi-Spy from RG Software </LI>
</UL>

<P>One other product appeared in December of 1990 of which I had heard
rumors. Its release foreshadowed a new direction the antivirus industry
would take in 1991. The product was Norton AntiVirus.</P>

<P>I never finished that review. Instead, one of the companies I had been
dealing with hired me as a programmer. In January of 1991 I accepted a
job with Certus. I moved my family (wife and four kids) from sunny southern
California to snowy northern Ohio and began my career in anti-virus research.
</P>

<P>Also in January of 1991, Roger Riordan of Cybec in Australia discovered
a Stoned variant. He found that it triggered on the birthday of a Max Telfer.
Max, evidently not wanting the thing named after him, suggested the name
of someone else born on that day. So Roger named it <B><I>Michelangelo</I></B>.
</P>

<P>In March, at an anti-virus conference, Roger gave me a copy of the virus.
I really didn't think much about it at the time. I had no inkling at all
of the magnitude of media mayhem that Michelangelo would cause. </P>

<P>Also in March, Dark Avenger announced on a Bulgarian BBS that he and
his friends were working on a new virus that would mutate in 1 of 4,000,000,000
different ways. That &quot;virus&quot; didn't appear until January of 1992
and actually turned out to be something that hit the anti-virus community
harder than Michelangelo hit the press. It wasn't actually a virus, it
was a object file to link to viruses. It was a mutation engine (<A HREF="engine1.htm#MTE">MtE</A>).
</P>

<P>Additionally in March of 1991, the <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#VCS">VCS V1.0</A>
was discovered. VCS stands for Virus Construction Set. The set allowed
the user to build viruses. Other virus construction kits followed. Nowhere
Man's <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</A> (Virus Construction Lab) had a
nice Borland-like DOS interface and allowed the user to build viruses by
pointing and clicking. Later, Phalcon/Skism's <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#PSMPC">PS-MPC</A>
also allowed virus mass-production. Look in any anti-virus products virus
list and you're sure to see lots and lots of VCL and PS-MPC viruses. </P>

<P>April of 1991 saw the discovery of the ultimate SPaM virus. <B><I>Tequila</I></B>
is not only Stealth, Polymorphic, and Multipartite, it is also an anti-anti-virus
virus (or retrovirus) and uses tunneling. </P>

<P>On a plane ride with Peter Tippett, returning from that conference in
March, we discussed anti-virus techniques and problems. The result of that
discussion was a new product called Novi. We designed it so that it detected
common viruses during installation and thereafter prevented infection by
known and unknown viruses. The box said &quot;No Updates Required.&quot;
Novi was released in September of 1991. In the following month a new type
of virus was discovered and we had to update Novi. </P>

<P>The DirII virus did not infect in the traditional ways. It has been
termed a &quot;linking virus&quot; and &quot;cluster virus.&quot; It actually
places a single copy of itself on the disk. Then it infects by setting
the cluster pointers in directory sectors to point to itself. </P>

<P><B>Corporate Takeover</B> </P>

<P>The antivirus industry started to look, smell, and taste like money.
</P>

<P>The big news in the antivirus industry in 1991 involved the utility
software companies in the United States. After Symantec released Norton
AntiVirus, their competitors jumped in by repackaging Israeli anti-virus
products. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Central Point released CPAV (Carmel's Turbo AntiVirus). </LI>

<LI>Fifth Generation released Untouchable (BRM's V-Analyst). </LI>

<LI>X-Tree released ViruSafe (EliaShim's ViruSafe). </LI>
</UL>

<P>The last two were actually released in January of 1992. The other main
anti-virus product from Israel, AntiVirus Plus from Iris, was later licensed
by Cheyenne Software. </P>

<P>In the years that followed 1991, an amazing consolidation occurred.
It seemed to start when Symantec bought Certus. I moved back to California
and worked on Norton AntiVirus 3.0. </P>

<P>The consolidation went like this: </P>

<UL>
<LI>1992 - Symantec acquires Certus (and I move back to California). </LI>

<LI>1993 - Central Point Merges with X-Tree. </LI>

<LI>1993 - Symantec acquires Fifth Generation. </LI>

<LI>1994 - Symantec acquires Central Point. </LI>

<P><B>Vendor Nightmares</B> </P>

<P>In January of 1992 we received Dark Avenger's mutation engine. Not too
long before this Fridrik Skulason and Alan Solomon had wrestled with descriptions
of variably modified decryption routines and coined the term &quot;polymorphic&quot;
as it applies to computer viruses. Here was polymorphism incarnate. </P>

<P>In February, I traveled to California for meetings with other anti-virus
vendors. I liked the term &quot;polymorphic&quot; so much that I drilled
it into everyone else's psyches. The trip included a dinner with John Dvorak.
Soon after, he wrote an article pushing the MtE, polymorphism, and multipartitism.
</P>

<P>It is of interest that Dark Avenger took several months to produce his
mutation engine and most anti-virus developers had detection for it in
a day or two. Well, actually, many had detection that was too good. They
could detect 101 percent (all MtE samples and a few other files). MtE brought
to light the high risk of false positives in polymorphic viruses. Many
of us went back to the drawing boards. </P>

<P>As if this wasn't enough, before 1992 was over, Dark Avenger send us
his next nightmare creation. Commander Bomber was highly polymorphic, but
not encrypted. Moreover, we had to coin another term to describe the way
it infected. It was the first polymorphic, permutation virus. </P>

<P>Other innovative viruses appeared in 1992: </P>

<UL>
<LI>EXEBug introduced CMOS modification to prevent clean booting. </LI>

<LI>Groove was the first .EXE infecting MtE virus. It also targeted many
anti-virus products. </LI>

<LI>Invol was the first .SYS infector. It was also slightly polymorphic.
</LI>

<LI>Starship was a SPM, slow infector. It also introduced a new way to
infect the hard drive. </LI>

<LI>V-Sign was the first polymorphic boot sector virus.</LI>

<LI>WinVer 1.4 was the first Windows virus. </LI>

<P><B>User Nightmares</B> </P>

<P>March meant Michelangelo media mayhem. As in the case of the DataCrime
virus in 1989, Michelangelo hit the headlines in early 1992. The differences
were that Michelangelo actually was in the wild and that there were more
anti-virus companies competing for user dollars. Predictions of destruction
ranged from one company spokesman who allegedly claimed that as many as
5 million systems would go down, to another company spokesman who said
that it was more likely that you'd spill coffee in your keyboard than get
the virus. </P>

<P>Below is an example of how the headlines paralleled the DataCrime frenzy.
The relevant headlines just in the Los Angeles Times were: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Michelangelo Virus Is Alive and Virulent, Waiting for March 6 - Feb
21 </LI>

<LI>Doomsday Nears for Infected PCs - Feb 20 </LI>

<LI>Most Escape Brush With 'Michelangelo' - Mar 7 </LI>

<LI>Few Casualties From Dreaded Computer Virus - Mar 8 </LI>
</UL>

<P>The full extent of this media mayhem was documented by Pamela Kane in
an article titled &quot;Anatomy of a Virus Scare&quot; (ISPNews of May/June
1992) and in her book <I>P.C. Security and Virus Protection Handbook</I>.
</P>

<P>While cases of the virus were few, anti-virus software sales soared.
Because of this, some anti-virus companies appear to have thought that
this feast would continue. Some overextended themselves and were unready
for the sales famine that followed later in the year. Some of those companies
no longer exist.</P>

<P>In mid-1993 I moved back to California to work at Symantec's Peter Norton
Product Group. About this same time I started a personal project to document
exactly which viruses were being reported in the wild. I compiled a list
of 100 viruses from various lists of &quot;common viruses&quot; and posted
it to other members of CARO. I asked them to confirm or challenge each
virus on the list. </P>

<P>In July I posted the first official WildList. </P>

<P>A number of significant new viruses appeared in 1993. </P>

<P>Soon after the release of MS-DOS 6.0, which contained Central Point
Anti-Virus (CPAV) under the name Microsoft Anti-Virus (MSAV), a virus appeared
in Germany that contained code to disable the resident portion of this
anti-virus product. That virus was Tremor, which is still fairly common
in Europe. </P>

<P>A buggy, bloated new virus appeared in the wild in the Washington, DC
area that was called <B><I>SatanBug</I></B>. The virus got some minor press
coverage. With the assistance of the anti-virus industry, federal agents
tracked down its author and paid him a visit. Since he was a minor nothing
came of the investigation. </P>

<P>Another virus that appeared was <B><I>Monkey</I></B>. Monkey is loosely
based on the Stoned virus, but is full-stealth and stores the original
master boot record (MBR) in an encrypted form. Unlike Stoned the virus
does not leave the original partition table for the infected drive in place.
The result is that the drive is invisible to DOS if the system is booted
from an uninfected floppy diskette. </P>

<P>An additional problem with Monkey involved a &quot;cure-all&quot; technique
that was publicized and became popular after Michelangelo became well known.
The technique involves using an undocumented option with FDISK (a partitioning
utility shipped with DOS). Using the command &quot;fdisk /mbr&quot; writes
the code portion of the master boot record, but doesn't make any changes
to the partition table in the MBR. </P>

<P>For viruses like Stoned and Michelangelo this overwrites the start of
the virus code and leaves the partition information. The technique does
&quot;kill&quot; the virus. In the case of Monkey-like viruses that don't
preserve the partition information using this command &quot;kills&quot;
the virus and leaves virus code in the partition table. The drive is then
inaccessible to DOS. </P>

<P>Other interesting viruses this year were: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Strange, a boot virus that exploits an undocumented bug in DOS versions
(early versions of PC-DOS and all versions of MS-DOS). </LI>

<LI>Cruncher, touted as a &quot;good&quot; virus because it compresses
infected programs and gives the user more disk space.</LI>

<P>During 1994 there were a number of interesting new viruses as well as
some non-incidents. </P>

<P>A virus called <B><I>Kaos4</I></B> was posted to the alt.binaries.pictures.erotica
news group in a file called Sexotica. </P>

<P>The virus, which was encoded as text, was downloaded by a number of
users, decoded into an executable program and run on their systems. In
this way, visitors to this particular location along the superhighway,
launched a small epidemic. </P>

<P>Fortunately, Kaos4 is a truly mediocre virus. Had it been a more effective
virus, it could easily have become pandemic. As it is, the virus is still
reported in the wild in many countries. </P>

<P>Another virus called Chill, or Chill Touch, was found in some games
on ZiffNet. Few were downloaded via Compuserve and the virus, like Kaos4,
was mediocre, so the virus never really spread. </P>

<P>A virus called <B><I>Junkie</I></B> appeared and there was some initial
press release hype about it. The virus was not initially wide spread, but
has slowly taken hold and has become slightly common. </P>

<P>A destructive virus called <B><I>Pathogen</I></B> appeared in England.
It contained a polymorphic engine called <A HREF="engine2.htm#SMEG">SMEG</A>
and was written by Black Baron. The author was later <A HREF="lgguilty.htm">tracked
down by New Scotland Yard's Computer Crime Unit and jailed. </A></P>

<P>Two notable viruses appeared during 1994 that have since become quite
common. Both are polymorphic and multipartite. These are <B><I>One_Half</I></B>
and <B><I>Natas</I></B> (Satan spelled backwards).</P>

<LI>PC-DOS 7.0 released. </LI>

<LI>Windows 95 released. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The year began quietly enough. Things were continuing as in the past.
Everyone was waiting for the release of Chicago (Windows 95) and wondering
what effect the new operating system would have on the future of anti-virus.
</P>

<P>It was known that the most common viruses were boot viruses which would
not replicate under Windows 95. Some anti-virus companies were starting
to foresee the death of their anti-virus products as DOS died. Then in
August every thing changed. </P>

<P>Sarah Gordon at Command Software Systems discovered and analyzed a new
type of virus. Jimmy Kuo suggested a name the next day. Since that time
it has been called Concept. Concept was a <A HREF="miscella.htm#macrovir">macro
virus</A>. </P>

<P>Concept is a macro virus written in WordBASIC (an interpreted programming
language similar to Visual Basic for Applications). The language is built
into the Microsoft Word environment. Specifically, the virus is written
in the English-language implementation of WordBASIC. Therefore, Concept
will not run within the MS-Word environment if WordBASIC has been implemented
in another language. </P>

<P>DOS viruses run in the DOS environment, Mac viruses run in the Mac environment,
and Concept runs in the MS-Word environment. Thus, Concept <B>appears</B>
to be cross-platform. It runs on systems that MS-Word runs on (Windows
95, Windows NT, Macintosh, etc.). But, Concept is not a Windows virus or
a Macintosh virus. It is an MS-Word virus. The MS-Word environment is the
operating system that Concepts replicates within. </P>

<P>Although the anti-virus community has pointed out that the idea of macro
viruses is nothing new, most of the product developers were quite unprepared
for Concept. </P>

<P>Dealing with Concept involves more than simply releasing a signature
or a new database. Most anti-virus product developers have had to make
major code changes in their products. </P>

<P>That the anti-virus community was unprepared is illustrated by the fact
that Virus Bulletin's July, 1996 testing reported that eight of twenty-four
scanners they tested (using default mode) failed to detect Concept. One
third of these anti-virus products missed the world's most common virus.
</P>

<P>By the end of 1995, several other macro viruses were produced. While
this new type of virus required a rethinking of viruses, it actually also
breathed new life into the anti-virus field. </P>

<P>The new operating systems are no longer a hostile environment for viruses.

<P>During 1996 many more macro viruses have appeared. A few (Nuclear, NOP,
and Wazzu) have become fairly common, but by no means a common as Concept.
By the middle of the year, Concept was clearly the most common virus in
the world. </P>

<P>Also in 1996 the first virus specifically for Windows 95 appeared. The
virus, <B><I>Boza</I></B>, is a pitiful virus and is highly unlikely to
spread. It was, however, widely publicized by anti-virus vendors and the
press.</P>

<P>In like manner, another virus called <B><I>Hare</I></B> was also trumpeted
far and wide by the publicists. It became wide spread by being downloaded
from the Internet, but is also buggy, mediocre, and unlikely to spread.</P>

<P>Still another notable virus caught the attention of the anti-virus marketing
community. This was Laroux. </P>

<P>Laroux is notable as the first virus to successfully infect Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets. It was first discovered and analyzed by Sarah Gordon
of Command Software Systems. However, like Hare, only a few reports of
the virus in the wild have been received (actually, only two sites at this
writing). </P>
