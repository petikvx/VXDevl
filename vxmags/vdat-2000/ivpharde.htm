<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started when I was about 12 old. my first computer is XT 8086 with
CGA. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I got a copy of some viruses (dark avenger, denzuko, brain, and liberty)
from my father and was interested about the cool payload from denzuko and
liberty. but I don't have too much about computer viruses in that period.
bla..bla.. and the last I found the sayha watpu and die hard viruses from
my disk.bla..bla<BR>
I don't remember when I started my first virus...right now I have created
20 viruses (maybe). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>yup! I don't remember my virus names..hmmmm...bla..bla...Word.Phardera:
my word macro viruses...Vesselin Bontchev make some credit for Word.Phardera
in his paper (thanks VB). Phardera.Ita: this 'real' virus was written using
Borland Pascal 7.0. And my best virus is Phardera.5824. This virus uses
polymorphism, stealth, and a lot of antidebugging tricks. This virus is
found in the wild. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't give names to my viruses...the AV community does that. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Assembly (must), Basic, Pascal, and Indonesian :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>assembly, the language hackers must have! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It is difficult for me to the answer that question. In 1996 I joined
in the <A HREF="groups2.htm#VBB">VBB</A> group founded by Dark Night, but
so far I don't know where Dark Night is. I think VBB is a vacuum. And last
I join to <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A>. But SLAM was hacked by kiddist
and kicked me out (FUCK!). Now I have joined Kecoak, a Indonesian hacking
group. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?

<UL>
<P>sorry... I don't need it. </P>
</UL>

</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

AVP claim can detect this virus, but they can detect 1% from my sample
