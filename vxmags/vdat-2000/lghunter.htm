  <p align="left">In the wake of the Explore worm, law enforcement is looking 
    ever more vigilantly for the virus writer-- or writers-- behind the program. 
    Here's an inside look at the process. </p>
</div>
<p> 
<p> Lee Altschuler is the former chief assistant US attorney in charge of computer 
  crime prosecutions in San Jose. He spoke with Luke Reiter in July of 1998 to 
  outline laws relating to computer and Internet crimes. He reviewed how law enforcement 
  treats a variety of crimes, from posting viruses to hacking, to what a "protected" 
  PC means. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CyberCrime</b> Are there any laws against writing programs that are designed 
  to damage computers? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Laws have been on the books, in various forms, since about 
  1981 concerning computer hacking and computer fraud and abuse. And over time 
  they've gotten much more tailored to the problems that we face on a day-to-day 
  basis. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So if you write a program that is designed to do damage to somebody's 
  computer, is there a law that makes that illegal? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Federal prosecutors are very interested in cases where someone 
  causes a code or command to be transmitted to somebody else's computer. And 
  that's the kind of case that can be prosecuted under law as it currently stands. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So if you write a program and post it on the Internet, and the program 
  is a utility that enables you to get unauthorized access to somebody's program, 
  but you don't actually run that program yourself, how does the law view you 
  then? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> The law views you &#91;as&#93; little different from the 
  irresponsible person who posts bomb-making instructions on the Internet. Right 
  now, that's not illegal.
</p>
<div align="center"><b><font size="+2">When Virus-writing Becomes Illegal</font></b> 
</div>
<p> <b>CC</b> It's not illegal to post bomb instructions, or to post virus programs 
  on the Internet, provided that you don't run those programs yourself?

<!-- End Pullquote --> <b>Altschuler</b> Well, in the investigation, if it develops 
that the person had knowledge of what was going to happen when those instructions 
were posted, it could be a very uncomfortable position for the writer as well 
as the user of the program. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> In that situation, you would attempt to charge the virus writer, 
  say, as an accessory to the ultimate crime? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Accessory or a co-conspirator, or aiding and abetting the 
  violation. There's certainly not a safe harbor for doing this sort of socially 
  irresponsible activity. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Are you familiar with cases that have been made against people who 
  have written programs like that? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Cases have been made all over the country, from Guam all 
  the way to New York on these kind of issues. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> And have there been people who have written the code, but not run 
  them who have also been held accountable? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Well, it's hard to find a case where one but not the other 
  happens. They're really inseparable, based on experience so far.
</p>
<div align="center"><b><font size="+2">Snooping Around: Trojan Horses</font></b> 
</div>
<p> <b>CC</b> Let's focus on what happens if you are the person responsible for 
  using one of these utilities. What are the laws that apply to using computers 
  to gain unauthorized access? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Gaining unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, 
  in connection with a computer used in interstate commerce or a government computer, 
  is a very serious criminal violation. The FBI has specially trained agents who 
  investigate these kinds of matters, and US attorney's offices across the country 
  have specially trained prosecutors to bring these cases in court. The penalties 
  range from five to 10 years for a first offense, and as long as 20 years for 
  a repeat offender. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Some groups, like the Cult of the Dead Cow, say that they're developing 
  these tools and utilities as a form of social protest - to reveal the inadequacy 
  of current security measures by companies like Microsoft. Do you see this as 
  a form of civil disobedience? Is this a form of social protest? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Writing the program is different from running it. Running 
  the program, or making it available to people who run it, is akin to providing 
  maps on how to break into another person's home, and it's not a very nice thing 
  to do. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> Aside from not being a nice thing to do, do you think there are 
  larger social implications to this? Could this be seen as the cyberspace equivalent 
  of a sit-in by a civil rights organization? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> I think it's the cyberspace equivalent of peering in another 
  person's bedroom window late at night. And I think there is little redeeming 
  value to it. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So you would suggest that these groups find other ways to demonstrate 
  their unhappiness with current security measures? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> There are a whole host of ways that one can work constructively 
  in order to address defects in current security measures. And that's the way 
  that one lives under the rule of law. 
</p>
<div align="center"><b><font size="+2">Unauthorized Access: When is Hacking Illegal?</font></b> 
</div>
<p> <b>CC</b> There's a difference in some people's minds between those who simply 
  access computers without authorization, and those who do damage once they get 
  inside. Does the law make that distinction? 
<p>

    <td align=LEFT valign=TOP> <b> In fact, it's hard to find a case where &#91;people&#93; 
      can snoop in a computer and be assured that they're not committing a crime.<br>
      -Lee Altschuler </b> </td>

<!-- End Pullquote --> <b>Altschuler</b> Accessing another's computer without 
authorization is a high risk proposition. If one does that without permission, 
the law holds the trespassing individual strictly liable for any damage, whether 
intended or not. It's little different from attempting to rob a bank and causing 
a customer to suffer a heart attack. Bank robbers are well advised to be careful 
when they rob banks. And computer hackers stand in essentially the same position. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> In the event that no damage does occur, whether intentionally or 
  inadvertently, but someone is simply interested in getting access to your information-– 
  in reading your email, in reading your hard drive-– are there laws that prevent 
  them from simply being in there in the first place? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> The federal law reaches very broadly right now. It protects 
  not only government computers, financial institution computers, computers that 
  are used to send messages between different states. In fact, it's hard to find 
  a case where one can snoop in a computer and be assured that they're not committing 
  a crime. 
<p align="center"><b><font size="+2">'Protected' PCs: Penalties for Hacking</font></b> 
<p> <b>CC</b> There is a law, Section 1030, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act it's 
  often called, which makes it a crime to knowingly cause the transmission of 
  a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally 
  cause damage without authorization to a protected computer. Is that the law 
  that you're speaking of? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Yes. 
<p> 
<p> <!-- Begin Pullquote --> 
<table width="175" align="RIGHT" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

<!-- End Pullquote --> <b>CC</b> When it says "protected computer," there's a 
broad understanding of what that means? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> "Protected computer" covers a lot of real estate in cyberspace. 
  Financial institutions, U.S. government, private businesses doing work for the 
  government, or computers used to send messages between states, are all protected 
  computers. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> As a prosecutor, could you make a case that somebody who puts a 
  program up that has the ability to cause damage to somebody else's computer-– 
  or to many computers-– is knowingly transmitting a program with the intent that 
  it ultimately cause damage to a protected computer? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> That's a very interesting question. And it's hard to answer 
  it in the abstract. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> So you would need to go on a case by case basis? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Right. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> You say that law enforcement agencies are trying to track down the 
  people who are running these programs. Is it practical, or even possible, to 
  find these people? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> It's very possible. It's very practical. The FBI runs computer 
  intrusion squads all over the United States, as close to us as San Francisco, 
  and as far away as Washington, D.C., and many places in between. 
<p> 
<p> <b>CC</b> For example, the CIH virus that has been widely reported in the 
  last week or so, was reportedly written by someone in Taiwan. 
<p> <i>&#91;Editor's Note: The author of the CIH virus was a university student 
  from Taiwan.&#93;</i> 
<p> 
<p> If that program were to be run on computers in the United States by an individual 
  in a country like Taiwan, do we really have the mechanisms here to find that 
  person and get some justice? 
<p> 
<p> <b>Altschuler</b> Intergovernmental cooperation is increasing every day. Prosecutors 
  in most developed countries have working relationships with U.S. prosecutors. 
  Treaty arrangements are steadily broadening to reach computer crime. 
<p> 
<p> There are few places where a hacker is completely safe from the long arm of 
  the law. And there are indeed cases now where FBI agents have traveled overseas 
  to interview hackers, and the hackers are then prosecuted either by their home 
  government or by the U.S. government.
