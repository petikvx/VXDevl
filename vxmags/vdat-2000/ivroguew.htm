<HR WIDTH="100%"></P></CENTER>

<P>Here is a small interview that I, <A HREF="groups1.htm#IKX">b0z0</A>,
made to Rogue Warrior of <A HREF="groups1.htm#GEN">Genesis</A>. Let's see
what he prospects for the future and what does it think about some specific
topics of interest to our readers :)</P>

<P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who you are and what you do everyday??? :)
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am Rogue Warrior, I am mainly using my computer all day. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why 'Rogue'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I chose that to make it sound evil. Which newspaper will write about
&quot;Snoopy&quot; the virus coder? not many... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you started dealing with computers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started when young (forget exactly when), then i stopped and later
restarted with an IBM PC when in school. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which was your first experience in the underground
computing world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I first discovered a fidonet VIRUS group and found some friend who gave
me a few viruses. I taught myself to code viruses from it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you join Genesis? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="ivrajaat.htm">Rajaat</A> and myself formed Genesis, so it is
more a matter of when was it started - about 1 year ago. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why do you write virii and when you started
writing them? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I write them for revenge, fun, fame, challenge, protest, so many reasons
:) Started writing them in school. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which docs/material do you keep for most valuable
for programming viriis? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well being famous for the crappy Nuclear, i got all my info from the
Help sections (hit F1 key) </P>

<P>As for my DOS viruses i use INTERRUPT list by Ralph Brown (rarely) and
some reference books which are really crap - I know most stuff off by heart
so don't usually need reference material. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which did you used most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmm I don't know probably the very first ASM book i got - I stick with
what I know :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know and
which do you use? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Asm, C, C++, Word Basic ... about 9 total languages, and a few scripting
languages.<BR>
Only use: asm, C <BR>
All languages are self-taught except for one. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many viriis did you write? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have written heaps (30 or more) but I have only ever released Nuclear
to public - I will release some good DOS viruses now that I am in Genesis.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viriis? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I pick cool sounding names on TV :) or evil sounding names. </P>

<P>Eugene's crew picked WinMacro.Nuclear name and i thought it was an EXCELLENT
choice - good job bastards!.. it was called Winword but the AV had to change
because of MicroSloth trademarks and shit. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you spread your viriis? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have never spread viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you make also destructive viriis? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes sure! What good is a virus without a payload. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you prefer a specific type of virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I like Polymorphic viruses, especially ones which are very hard
to remove (gives AV support persons more grief) - One Half is probably
my favourite virus. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which virus do you consider 'a good virus'?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>One Half - difficult to remove and detect<BR>
Bomber - for same reason (easier to remove)<BR>
Natas - cleaness of code (ie lack of errors) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think to continue to working on wordmacros?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yeah only for fun, they are so easy to detect butI'm sure there will
be people wanting to see more still :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you spreaded Nuclear yourself or how it
spreaded? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I never spread nuclear. Although I did attach it to Eugene's text
for a joke. If someone spread Eugene's infected document I did not request
for it to happen. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which can be the right approach from tha AV
people to fight macro-virii? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Heuristic Document Scanning building a profile of Macro Names -and-
the tokens in the template, adding a weighting for each particular attribute
a file has and then triggering an alert if the sum of these values goes
above a threshold. <BR>
Not many macro's should need to use MacroCopy, Kill, AutoOpen. <BR>
Pretty simple crap really.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the rumours that Concept
was written by a MS employee? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sounds plausible, they could have made it do something more - It's rather
lame (Isn't it like an M$ programmer to make a crap program? ;) - but then
again so is Nuclear. <BR>
Nuclear is 99% AV marketing hype. Look at Joe's wild list - it isn't even
reported in one place yet. <BR>
Plus it's got those bugs! I hate bugs - Nuclear2 will be bug free and the
dropper will work and it will drop DOS or/and Windows viruses (I've tested
it! ;). <BR>
Maybe I will deliver a payload when ToolsMacro is activated (like Vess
suggested). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any plans for Win95 or NT native virii? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, in the future I will switch to writing for Win95/NT. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you consider the actual virus scene?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>1% great virus writers<BR>
4% good virus writers<BR>
5% average virus writers<BR>
30% collectors<BR>
60% morons </P>

<P>I don't know where i fit in this table - we'll see. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How are your contacts with components of other
vw groups? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I talk to many people from the different active and inactive groups,
but usually I do it anonymously. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who is the greatest virus writer in your eyes?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well I cannot pick just one, <A HREF="ivdarkav.htm">Dark Avenger</A>
must be the best for new ideas, vyvojar must be the best for troubling
AV scanners and <A HREF="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">Bit Addict</A> is a wizard
with size+speed+correctness of his viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the current circumstances
in alt.comp.virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It sucks shit. AV get the fuck out (go back to comp.virus now it's back
up) - VX start posting *NEW* viruses to group. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about Antivirus Resarchers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Researchers :) I think it's an alias for &quot;virus collector&quot;
:) What is there to research eh? Neural nets for detecting viruses?<BR>
Researchers at the virus labs? well they are just asm programmers who work
in AV sweatshops. They should join the VX team! <BR>
TBAV's heuristics could be MUCH better than the shit it is now. All the
other scanners suck too. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the AV market in general?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If it were not for us - they would not exist - they denounce us in public
and cheer us when they pay for their mortage. They had better start thinking
about moving out of the AV business because it won't be big enough for
all of them soon. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV product would you use if you had to?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>AV product? Probably one you've never heard of :) <BR>
The mainstream AV product I would choose is AVP it has a nice code emulator
and the author(s) are not afraid to use unclean methods to detect viruses.
<BR>
I also like the way AVP cures viruses in memory while the virus is still
active - F-PROT and TBAV are too gutless for this and say &quot;please
boot from a clean boot disk&quot;. <BR>
AVP realise that most people don't have a boot disk and if they do it's
probably infected :-) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the future of viriis?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Their future is bright for Win* systems - they will not become extinct
as some people say. MS-DOS will be around for many years yet and Win95
has security flaws ;) It's just a case of applying old tricks to the new
environments. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about the Java language in
virus writing? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Java - possible to make a very cheesy virus<BR>
JavaScript - impossible </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you make part also of other parts of computer
underground (hacking, phreaking, carding...)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>none </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about general legal problems
concerning virii writing in your country? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Making virus writing a jailable offence would not work - It would only
inspire me to work harder and be even more careful about it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about countries where even
the storing of virii code is strongly prohibited? Where does this lead
us to? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't care much for local laws - I reside on the Internet this place
is essentially anarchy and you can do what you want. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion about the internet censorship?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>it is bad of course! stop it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you thing about the IKX? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think you are a great group. With good ideas for the future. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you have any advice for us? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You should work hard to bring freshness to the collective scenes (h/p/a/v/c)
and don't worry about your non-destructive policy :). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any new release from you in the near future?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nope ;) too lazy! </P>
</UL>
