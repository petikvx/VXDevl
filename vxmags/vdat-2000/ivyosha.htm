<p><b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What religious beliefs do you hold?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Agnostic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What music do you listen to?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Aphex Twin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you find out about computers?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My father bought an Apple II/e and showed me a few simple programs in BASIC. 
    I've been a programmer ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you discover computer viruses?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was infected by Natas. Luckily, a bug in the MBR routine caused it to hang 
    on bootup, so I never experienced the payload. I just had to boot from floppy 
    for a long time until a cleaner came out. Shortly after that, I leart assembly 
    language and began writing some cheesy viruses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What was your first virus like?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My first virus was an overwriting COM infector. The next version of it was 
    oglimorphic, it swapped instructions around based on a table with pointers 
    to the instructions that could be swapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you start writing viruses?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I wanted lots of computers to suffer like mine had :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That's the hardest part. I struggle with this, seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages have you been fluent in?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pascal, C/C++, Assembly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you like to lay out your source code?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My source is very sloppy and unorganised. Comments are all over the place. 
    I imagine my source is pretty hard to read. Lately however, my source has 
    begun to take on a little bit of neatness. Once you start coding large viruses, 
    you can't afford to have sloppy code or you'll forget what certain parts of 
    it do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your thoughts on destructive code?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I first became involved with the virus scene, my viruses were destructive 
    as hell. I've mellowed out since then. I no longer get pleasure out of destruction. 
    I haven't written a destructive payload in years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">How has your virus writing impacted your 'real life'?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>They take time away from partying, that's all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you use yourself?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use AVP to scan for and clean viruses, and TBAV to remove heuristic flags 
    and fine tune my own poly engines. However, I think Dr Solomon's AV is good 
    too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your thoughts about those who create viruses in non-ASM languages?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>High level viruses are the way of the future. Size and disk access time are 
    incredibly unimportant as hardware gets faster and Windows becomes more of 
    a hog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do others in your personal life know that you write viruses?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone knows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">If you could be any animate object, then what object would you be?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'd be a big fat bud, and then I'd smoke myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">If you could be any inanimate object, then what object would you be?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Uh, I'd be a big fat bud...</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your virus infection hits a hospital and kills someone... are you depressed?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fuck no. There are too many people on the planet for a few deaths to really 
    matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">If, and when you die, what do you want written on your gravestone?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hoc Sugit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your thoughts on viruses and the law.</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The situation in the USA is fair for all. Damaging someone's computer is 
    wrong, and should be punished. However, the author of a virus should not be 
    held responsible, so long as he didn't spread the virus himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your favourite viruses?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Vyvojar's Level3 and One-Half are the best viruses around, though they are 
    getting pretty old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What virus technologies interest you the most?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Polymorphism, new infection techniques, and retro-AV.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your advice to those just beginning.</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Learn assembly language inside and out before you start writing viruses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">What you think lies in the future of virus coding?</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think polymorphism will become the most important part of a good virus, 
    that is, if it's not already. Eventually, engines will be so complex and variable, 
    that 100% detection will simply not be possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus.</FONT></B></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Stable, compatible, and wildly polymorphic.</p>
