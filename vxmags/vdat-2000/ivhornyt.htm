<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started out with an Apple II clone back in 1982. The big thing back
then was pirated software. I had hundreds of disks of games and all sorts
of shit. As far as programming back in those days, all I did was BASIC
and some graphics shit called LOGO. I ended up buying a second Apple II
clone (don't ask me why). I remember how great it felt buying my first
128k memory expansion cards for the Apple... fuck, 128k? Hell, that computer
couldn't even hold some of the smallest programs that I write today. I
started online stuff about a year later when I bought an Epson CP-20 Acoustic
Coupler 300 baud modem. My friends and I mostly hacked BBS's back then
and also fucked with Telenet to gain access to overseas stuff. After the
Apples, I moved on to the Mac Plus, what a leap! Didn't do much of anything
with the Mac, mostly just a college term paper machine. I then got into
PC's, where I have stayed ever since. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My first exposure to virii was back in 1985. My computer teacher Steve
was a software designer and virus writer. He used to show me the virii
that he would create, but like a stupid shit head that I was, I didn't
pay attention. Fuck. If I could only go back in time and start earlier
with virii... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I write a lot of virii, but I have jumped into research and development
for a while. There are so many copycats out there and not enough new ideas.
As for the ones that I will take credit for... Keep reading the <A HREF="ezines1.htm#CODE">Codebreakers
mag</A> and you will see the stuff that I have coded. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hell, it depends on what type of mood that I am in, what type of music
that I am listening to, what type of day I just had... Mainly something
to do with my handle - Horny Toad. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Assembly, Visual Basic, C and C++, Bourne Shell </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Assembly </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I am the editor of the <A HREF="ezines1.htm#CODE">Codebreakers
magazine</A>. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hell of a question... I use a combination of several AV programs, I
don't want to plug one in general. The problem is that we keep writing
better anti-AV stuff everyday, that you can't just use one detection program
and think that your computer is clean. If you tell me that you use only
&quot;Joe-Blows AV program&quot;, I will give you a list of 50+ virii people
have written to specifically exploit weaknesses in &quot;Joe-Blows AV program&quot;.
Diversify your defenses. Use different programs, especially if you are
into high-risk activities. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My main goals in the virus scene are to teach and research&amp;developement.
R&amp;D should be the number one priority of virus writers. With the advent
of new more advanced AV programs and more sophisticated operating systems,
we need very enthusiastic researchers to invent new techniques in the virus
field. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Just that it will remain continuous. Actually, I could care less about
the AV community, they have their job and I have mine. Don't be mistaken
about AV people. Their future is based on the fact that virii will always
be around. Do I want to make their lives a living hell? Yeah, I guess so,
that would be proof of my own successes in virus writing. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Actually, I can't really elaborate on when and where I got it. Another
group of hackers/virus writers kinda gave it to me. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>For the grand answer and long-winded narrative on this subject, read
the first edition of the Codebreakers mag. In a nutshell, I find them to
be useful tools if put in the correct perspective. If you plan on using
<A HREF="creators.htm">Virus Creation software</A>, remember that, just
because you entered the parameters for the VC program, the created virus
code is not actually yours. Use it to learn from. Once you get to an advanced
level of programming, try writing a virus creation program. Writing a truly
effective VC program is a challenge. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't particularly like to code macro virii. I am not criticizing
those who like macro virii. I encourage all types of virii. Exploit and
use the knowledge that you have. If you have a hard-on for PASCAL, and
can write virii in PASCAL, by all means do it. I don't really care for
all of the sensationalism that has surrounded macro virii, but if you want
to code them, go right ahead! Just try to be creative and innovative in
whatever it is you do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A number of my virii have been around, but never made it to the infamous
'in-the-wild' list...not yet! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Of course Codebreakers mag rules! </P>

<P>I think that <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> is pretty awesome,
good graphics and articles. <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</A> is great.
There really aren't any zines that I particularly dislike, some just need
a little more work than others. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know... Most groups come and go. I like <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
for some of the new research they have done, but most of there stuff was
left incomplete. I liked <A HREF="groups2.htm#PS">Phalcon-Skism</A> for
their ground-breaking virus work way back when. When I was first learning
how to code virii, I liked <A HREF="groups1.htm#IR">Immortal Riot</A> and
<A HREF="groups2.htm#NUKE">Nuke</A>. I guess that was back in my more destructive
days. I see the trend now for more sophisticated groups with a definitive
purpose - this is the reason why I think Codebreakers is such a kick-ass
group. We are a tight group of mature virus writers with a definite goal.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>None. They're all slimy bastards. I really hate Fred Cohen (AV). I can't
believe that they actually pay him money for the crap that he puts out.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Respect? Hard to say. Porn Stars. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hey, it's an aspect of virus writing that some people enjoy. I try not
to write anything incredibly destructive, but hell, most of the AV community
and the world in general view all virii as destructive. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Quality speaking, yes. Hard question to answer. 'Good' is relative to
who you are asking. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Unix SA and general systems upkeep (boring shit) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some of them know, I can't say they're too happy about my life in the
virus world...oh well. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I do a little hacking, but that's about it. General web stuff. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>NO! I think that they should fall under the freedom of speech shit.
It's not virii that are the problem, its lamers who fuck things up for
the rest of us by only using virii for their destructive capabilities.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Undetectable, small, fast, adapts to the environment that it is in and
reproduces like a motherfucker. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Windows 95/98 is a challenging platform for infections. I am currently
working on 32-bit virii. The AV community is breathing a sigh of relief
because of the successes that they are having in the inherent OS defenses...
just you guys wait!! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Basically, don't get discouraged. Virus writing is exciting and very
challenging. Try to read as much stuff as you can get your hands on about
virii. Don't start out with the most complicated techniques. Begin with
the basics and work up. Read the Codebreakers zines! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You can get in touch with me through the <A HREF="http://www.codebreakers.simplenet.com">Codebreakers</A>.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>All the members of the Codebreakers. Lord Shade. Dungeon Master. Worm.
Mrs. Horny Toad and my tadpoles. All of you are great. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any other comments? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Read the Codebreakers zines!<BR>
Research you ass off!<BR>
Virus writing is the most kick ass hobby in the world. I wish that I could
just quit my current job and write virii for a living. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you get into Codebreakers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started out in the <A HREF="groups2.htm#PEVF">Power Empire Virus Writing
Faction</A>. Basically, the organization of the PE began to fall apart,
so a number of us broke away and formed the Codebreakers.</P>

<P>Our goals for the Codebreakers:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Teach virus writing. </LI>

<LI>Attract into our group the top virus minds in the world. </LI>

<LI>Discover new coding techniques. </LI>

<LI>Set records in the virus world. </LI>

<LI>Work on any underground subject (hacking,pheaking,...) </LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is Codebreakers organized? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>SPo0ky is the leader and Arsonic is the co-leader. The rest of us all
have different functions within the group. The great thing about the Codebreakers
is that we are a small tight group. We are able to be very selective on
who we bring in to the group. There are no personality problems within
the group even though our members are from all over the world. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What part of the world are you from? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>All over. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will you release any tutorials or virus creators?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The Codebreakers zine acts as both a tutorial and general virus/hacking
zine. We plan to do it all - VCL's, tutorials, new techniques, new virii...
You name it, we plan to do it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is in your future and the future of Codebreakers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My future is to continue working in the Codebreakers as a teacher and
developer. I love working with and studying virii. The beauty about computers
is that you can never know everything. I will just continue on increasing
my knowledge the best I can. </P>

<P>Codebreakers:</P>

<P>Our group is only going to get bigger and better. We are currently recruiting
so much talent, we can only become stronger. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will Codebreakers increase the number of members?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes! We are always looking for new members. If you have something to
offer the group and are willing to work hard, go to the <A HREF="http://www.codebreakers.simplenet.com">Codebreakers
site</A> and submit an application. We are not accepting everyone, but
the select few that we feel can contribute to the collective. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will Codebreakers go into other scenes except
VX? (hacking, etc.) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We will be involved in all of the 'scenes'. Keep reading our zines and
you will see the extent of our knowledge. We will constantly be branching
out and diversifying our tutorials and articles. Keep tuned in. </P>
