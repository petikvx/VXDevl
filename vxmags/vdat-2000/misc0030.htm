  By chance, the data collection period fell around the date of eruption of the 
  Melissa e-mail virus. The Melissa virus hit corporate sites on Friday 26 March 
  1999. This MS-Word macro virus had the unusual attribute (for the time) of using 
  standard e-mail address books as a means of forwarding infected documents to 
  groups of 50 addresses &#150; many of which were distribution lists, since the 
  virus chose the first 50 items in the address books and several e-mail packages 
  store lists at the top of their address books. There were a total of 482,869 
  PCs in the sample of respondents questioned after M-day. 
  <p> Unfortunately, the data collected do not permit assertions about virus infections 
    and disasters among those respondents interviewed after M-day because we lacked 
    specific dates for the virus events that would allow us to distinguish between 
    interviews after M-day and events after M-day.</p>
  <p> However, we were able to calculate infection rates per 1,000 PCs per month 
    using a conservative estimate of one week of exposure to Melissa (in our opinion, 
    the actual exposure was about 3-5 working days).</p>
  <p> Of the 482,869 PCs that could have been exposed to Melissa in a single week, 
    a total of 3,650 were reported as infected by this virus, giving an infectivity 
    of about 7.6 infections per 1,000 PCs in the total sample. If we divide by 
    the conservative estimate of &frac14; of a month, this gives an approximate 
    average infectivity rate of ~30 per 1,000 PCs per month for all organizations 
    (whether infected by Melissa or not). Note: this interpretation takes no account 
    of the likelihood that once anti-virus software was updated to identify and 
    stop Melissa; its rate of incidence would fall. Similarly, increased prevalence 
    of macro checking by MS-Word would also interfere with Melissa&#146;s high 
    infectivity.</p>
  <p> What was the infectivity of Melissa in those organizations that were actually 
    infected? There were 48,225 PCs in the 20 infected organizations. The total 
    PCs infected in those cases was 3,650, giving an average infection rate of 
    76 per 1,000 PCs for each Melissa infection. If we guess that the actual exposure 
    to Melissa was limited to a single week, then the approximate monthly infection 
    rate might be around 300 PCs infected by Melissa per 1,000 PCs per month in 
    the organizations that encountered the virus if Melissa contacts were to persist 
    in the environment.</p>
  <p> In other words, the chance of encountering Melissa was around 30 per 1,000 
    PCs per month but once an organization was infected, 300 PCs might be infected 
    per outbreak over the course of a month. Again, this estimate takes no account 
    of the availability of updated anti-virus software and other measures that 
    could limit the spread of Melissa.</p>
  <p> Another way of looking at the data focused on disasters. There were 20 disasters 
    due to Melissa in our sample. In these cases of contact with Melissa, the 
    respondents reported a total of 48,225 PCs at risk. The estimated incidence 
    of disasters per month per 1,000 PCs among the affected organizations was 
    about 1.7.</p>
  <p> In an attempt to control for the retrospective bias, we compared costs of 
    Melissa disasters to the costs of other disasters reported in interviews after 
    M-day.</p>
  <p> Tables 25 and 26 show that Melissa did not cause longer downtime for servers 
    in disasters reported in interviews after M-day than for any other cases of 
    infected servers in the sample of respondents questioned after M-day. A Fisher&#146;s 
    Exact Test of independence (used because of the small cell sizes) showed that 
    there was no statistically significant difference in the downtime distribution 
    (p = 0.374). </p>

  <p align="left"> Table 28 shows how many cumulative person-days it took to get 
    over the effects of the Melissa virus compared with non-Melissa disasters 
    encountered by respondents questioned after M-day.</p>

  <p align="left">Fisher&#146;s Exact Test for Independence showed no significant 
    difference in the effort required for recovery from Melissa compared with 
    that for other kinds of virus disasters (p = 0.383).</p>
  <p align="left"> Similarly, there was no evidence of any difference in the initially 
    estimated costs required for cleanup after Melissa disasters compared with 
    the costs for recovery from other viruses according to respondents questioned 
    after M-day.</p>
  <p align="left"> Table 29 shows these data. Fisher&#146;s Exact Test showed 
    that these differences or larger could easily be ascribed to random sampling 
    alone (p = 0.864).</p>
