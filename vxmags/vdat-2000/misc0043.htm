<P> So this is the end of the <a href="groups2.htm#TRIDENT">TridenT</a> virus 
  research group. This article is a last goodbye from me to you, the reader. I 
  will tell you some more about myself and my career in the virus community. </P>
<P>
     Like many other virus writers, my interrest in these
     little creatures arose when I encountered one on my own
     computer. This happened in the spring of 1991. Fortunatly
     it wasn't a really desctructive one, and it didn't infect
     many of my files before I was able to track it down and
     clean it. Thanks to McAfee's stuff. I kept one copy of
     this little program because I was very fascinated by it.
     I had heard many wonderful stories about these viruses in
     the past so I was eager to learn more about it. I started
     disassembling it and so its mysteries were revieled to
     me.
</P><P>
     Soon after that I wondered if I would be able to write
     such a program too. I decided to just try it. I started
     building piece after piece. First there was only a
     program that installed itself resident in memory and
     wrote "GOTCHA!" to the screen when a program was
     executed. Then I learned how to read from and write to
     files, so I changed the program so that it would write a
     copy of itself after programs (*.COM). The last part of
     it was to make it able to first execute itself and after
     that execute the infected program. This was the hardest
     part, but when that was finnished, the circle was round!
     I added some other features like attribute-circumvention,
     file-time preservation and EXE-infection (this was quite
     tough). Then my very own virus was finnished and I felt
     very proud about it!
</P><P>
     At that time I was unsure about what to do with my virus.
     I didn't like the idea of spreading it in the wild
     because I had seen that viruses could be quite annoying
     and I didn't want to harm anybody. But I thought it would
     be nice if the virus got some attention. I was afraid of
     telling other people that I had written a virus, because
     the general attitude to viruses was very negative and I
     was afraid that a lot of people were gonna hate me and
     that I would be banned from BBS's etc, if it became known
     that I had written a virus. So I decided to anonymously
     send it to some anti-virus BBS's, hoping that it would
     get some attention. When after several months my virus
     appeared in VSUM and SCAN, I felt very proud again.
</P><P>
     At the same time that I wrote my virus I started reading
     the VIRUS echomail on fidonet. There I discovered, to my
     surpise, that the centre of the virus scene was located
     in Bulgaria. I read stories about a virus exchange BBS
     run by a guy named Todor Todorov, who had been banned
     from fidonet just some time before. I wanted to know more
     about this, so although the telephone rates were *very*
     high, I decided to take a look at it. I downloaded a few
     viruses there and I gave him mine in return. This was how
     I got involved in the virus scene.
</P><P>
     From that time the ball started rolling. I studied the
     viruses that I got from Todor's board and tried to write
     other kinds of viruses like non-resident viruses,
     spawning viruses, bootsector viruses and tiny viruses.
     One special virus got more attention than the others. In
     august 1991 the Dark Avenger wrote a message on fidonet
     about a so called 'mutation engine', a piece of code that
     would help to encrypt a virus in such a way that no
     scanner would be able to find it. I downloaded this file
     from Todor's Virus eXchange BBS, and I used it in one of
     my viruses. This one was called 'Pogue Mahone', because
     it played music from the Irish band the Pogues.
</P>
<P> About a year after that I found that the time was right to try to write a 
  polymorphic virus myself. This took quite a lot of work but the result was satisfactory. 
  The decryptors did not contain any constant code and it was fully polymorphic. 
  The polymorphic routine was first included in one of my viruses. At about the 
  same time I had joined the TridenT group. The group was still very unknown at 
  that time and we felt that we should do something about it, like putting out 
  a magazine (how original.. ;-) or some virus tool. After some discussions we 
  decided to take my polymorphic routine and put it out under the name '<a href="engine2.htm#TPE">TridenT 
  Polymorphic Engine</a>'. This is probably my most well known product. </P>
<P>
     During the past years I have written many different kinds
     of viruses. I started with some ordinairy rather
     unremarkable viruses, but I didn't like the idea of
     writing these kind of viruses over and over again. My
     goal became to write viruses that were special in some
     way or another. This resulted in viruses like WinVir,
     Cruncher and Jiskefet. In the end I had written almost
     any kind of viruses I could think of. Now, almost 4 years
     have passed from the moment that I started writing
     viruses. I'm not as fascinated by viruses anymore as I
     was in the beginning. And I think the same is true for
     many other people that have been active in the virus
     scene in all those years. So perhaps this is a good
     moment for us to put an end to it. It has been great fun.

<P> Farewell and peace to you all. </P>
