<p><b><font color="#004080"> Who are u ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> hehe i m a 35 yrs old guy... you was expecting i'm a beautiful blonde girl... 
    sorry dude :) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Interests ? hobbies ? occupations ? job ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> hobbies : mathematics, i would like to learn what is the Galoisian cohomology 
    of groups :) ...computers, reading. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Reading what ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> scifi is cool...Roger Zelazny (princes of Amber stories ) A.E Van Vogt (World 
    of Null-A), P.K Dick...damn they are all die :( </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> When did you first try a computer ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I was 16... in 1981... a long time ago </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Puter model ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> At this time , few people was owning their own puter. It was at school a 
    sun station, i was typing idiot programs in basic. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Sun ? was not so common ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Personal puter was not common... but puter was existing since a long time 
    ago :) My first program was, i can remember, computation of the roots of a 
    polynomial function My very own puter was....a ZX81, it was in 1983, i have 
    begun to learn z80 assembly. At university i have played with compatible IBM 
    PC but... my first pc... i have bought it ...in 1996 ! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Any interests in others parts of computer underground 
  (h/p/..) ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> No i have no other interest in other area of computer underground. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do your relations know about your interest in the 
  vx ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some knows, its not a secret ;), but... people don't care about computer 
    viruses so i don't piss them off with that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How and when did you first discover the virus scene 
  ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> In same time i have discovered internet in mid-1996 ... i think at that 
    time i was infected by "jumper", a boot sector virus. I was using windows3.1. 
    Virus computers have begun to fascinate me i have spent long time online to 
    search for some virus samples at this time, the bigger vx server was ilf.net. 
    I have spent long hours to download stuff there but.. my real discovery of 
    virus scene was when i have installed mirc on my puter, it was in mid-1997. 
    I have joined #virus channel both on effnet and undernet. In my early internet 
    days...i was just a collector </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Have you been a member of any group ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have accepted to join <a href="groups2.htm#TI">Technological Illusion</a> 
    group, founded by TechnoPhunk (where are you ?) in 1998-99 but... the group 
    is virtually dead ...cause i'm the only remaining member ;) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Why and when did you start learning to program ? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have started to program (seriously) when i was at university, i have learned 
    asm by myself. I can code turbo pascal, some basic and i have planned to learn 
    C/C++ one day. I like to code in asm. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> and about viruses written in languages other than 
  assembly ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't know very well macro stuff but... people can code that sort of virus 
    very quickly. So i suppose most of that viruses are hack or lame viruses but... 
    some are cool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What is your best/favourite virus you have written 
  ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> hard to say... my answer is... those i have not yet written :) i imagine 
    my skill in asm is increasing.. so my viruses will become more efficient and 
    complex. I hope! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What groups and which individual programmers do you 
  value most highly ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> A group is nothing itself, only members inside are important. coders i respect 
    the most: Vecna, Star0, Griyo..., Mandragore for his tcip stuff, and some 
    others i can't remember for now. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think of the virus scene? (in general 
  and in your own country) ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> macro coderz and viruses traders have done a take over on the virus scene. 
    I suppose there are few virus coders out there not coding in macro langage 
    provided by the stupid microsoft enterprise. On the other hand people don't 
    understand Msdos OS is dead. Who is still running Msdos executables? People 
    don't have the time to learn win32asm, the only true langage to design viruses. 
    So the future belongs to macro viruses... i m affraid of. Not only the future, 
    to be realist we can't forget 2/3 of viruses in the wild are macro viruses. 
    But we can notice since 3 yrs, the knowledge to write win32asm, virus is well 
    spreaded we have to thank guys like lord julus for his work (writing tutorial 
    to teach asm32 virus technics) So... if we want to see more win32asm viruses 
    out there we need to write good tutorials to make easier the way to write 
    win32asm viruses; learn from scratch by yourself is time consumming! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you believe in the 'perfect virus' ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> nope, viruses always have bugs or things they can't do to be highly compatible. 
    You have to not infect some files for example: antiviruses programs or packed 
    PE executables </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> and about destructive functions in vx ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Ok, if a virus want to survive it have to be not notice so if the virus 
    erases files or destructs boot sector, flash bios .... firstly it can't use 
    the puter , it just destroyed, to spread itself and secondly destroy something 
    is the better way to be noticed...and so be caught and killed. Moreover, i 
    don't have pleasure to destroy people datas and destroy is so easy What's 
    the interrest? The only funny way to destroy a puter, according me, is the 
    use of an axe ...yet more noticable but more efficient hehe. To say the truth 
    a virus is often destructive even if the virus wasn't designed to be destructive. 
    Have you ever tested a PE-infector on packed executables? Most of the time, 
    the PE target is overwritten </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How has the underground scene changed since you first 
  entered ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Msdos is dead so people don't want to learn asm to build dos executable 
    infectors anymore. At first sight it's useless (but itsn't) and Microsoft 
    has put macro langage everywhere and made the stuff for viruses coders more 
    easier. Nowdays most people learn macro langages (easy to begin) and code 
    macro virus simple and efficient to reach in the wild list. Happily, there 
    are lot of PE viruses also. But i suppose there are surely lesser than 700 
    viruses written in win32asm. Nowdays most of web pages dedicated to computers 
    viruses contain not viral samples at all!. The underground scene is invaded 
    by viruses traders (the scene is became a sort of stock exchange) There are 
    shitload of log files in the entire www! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What operating system(s) are you actually using ? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> i use only Win95 and Msdos. I like Norton Commander and NC runs under Msdos 
    (i dislike windows explorer) NC is a good environment to write viruses even 
    Win32 viruses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think of other part of Vx, like Worm 
  or trojans ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like worms, happy99 is one of my favorite. Troyans often are destructive 
    and most of the time easy to write so i hate them; but write a back door in 
    win32asm is not an easy task. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Have u ever been killed by a Virus, Worm or trojan 
  ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> i was mainly hit by my own viruses and few others. But happily no real threat. 
    It took lot of time to desinfect my puter last time i was hit 'cause i didn't 
    notice conagent.exe is a Msdos program so every time i was launching a Windows 
    program from a dos box i was hit again ! Tsr dos viruses fastly escape from 
    your control Direct action viruses are more easy to control. </p>
  <p> One day, a guy sent me a file to test, i trusted him the file was containing 
    a subseven version, it took me a lot of time to discover i was infected. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Are u afraid by busting ? How is the law in ur land 
  ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> i'm not affraid by busting i don't spread anything so why cops would like 
    busting me? As far i know , here no one was busting for viruses spreading. 
    But viruses spreading is illegal. Anyway, no one can't be sure to not be busting 
    when you're a virus coder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you consider yourself like a criminal ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> No i don't. I consider myself to be an artist ! Virus writing is the 8th 
    art :) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How are you giving names to your virii ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I try to name my viruses using uncommon names to be sure no other viruses 
    have the same name. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which zines do you read regulary ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> All the zines i can get out there, old and recent Cicatrix Vdat is a good 
    stuff , and lot of zines are good too. Unfortunately, i can't read russian 
    and several e-zines are written in russian :( . I know some people don't like 
    using english but unfortunately, it's the only mean to be read in the entire 
    world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think the future of virus writing holds 
  ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> At the beginning of virus computers, if you knew how to infect a com executable 
    you was considered to be an elite coder. Nowdays, write viruses to infect 
    Windows executable is not so easy. i suppose in the future things will be 
    even harder to write viruses; the minimum knowledge to write viruses will 
    be hard to master. I think macro viruses will disappear... i don't mean macro 
    langages will disappear too ,but according me, Microsoft can easily stop macro 
    viruses to be a threat. But is Microsoft want really to stop the spreading 
    of macro viruses? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What advice could you give to newbies entering the 
  virus scene ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Remember, even elite virus coders were lamers at beginning! Do not read 
    "Little black book of viruses" chapter on exe infection. (Chapters on com 
    infection are good) Read instead, vdat .It contains several old and more recent 
    tutorials on virus stuff. Anyway, you have to know before writing anything, 
    virus writing is time consumming! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> About language that a newbie should learn to start 
  writing viruses ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> If you want to be famous and be busted, learn macro langage stuff and spread 
    your creations :) Knowledge is free but that don't mean knowledge is easy 
    to learn and master. There is always a price to pay. More the stuff is hard 
    to do/understand more the pleasure is greater when you do/understand it! So 
    if you want to have lot of fun try to learn the more difficult things. Win32asm 
    is a good langage for viruses writing and seems to be became a standard in 
    Microsoft OS (win 95,win 98 , win nt, win 2k) So before the next release of 
    Microsoft OS in 2002, learn win32asm stuff isn't useless , two years is an 
    eternity in computer world ! The stuff to compile win32asm listing is widely 
    avalaible on www Even if you don't want to use warez you have several alternatives. 
    Microsoft gives you the opportunity to use its assembler: masm If you don't 
    like Microsoft uses nasm a free assembler! But for beginners the best is Tasm5, 
    unhappily it isn't free. </p>

<p><b><font color="#004080"> Anything you would like to add ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Officer i' m not responsible neither for the concorde aircraft accident 
    neither for the russian submarine tragedy, i was in vacation when the accidents 
    occured. (august 2000) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Greets ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> greets to all coders they are trying to increase their coding skill and 
    people spreading the knowledge </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Any plugs ? (Homepage, email & more...) </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have planned since a long time to get a homepage, but nothing until now 
    I don't want to give an e-mail address cause' it costs a lot of money to retrieve 
    messages from my mailbox and i don't want to see shitload of silly messages 
    like that: "please send me the &lt;put here your favorite virus&gt; virus"; 
    i waste enough time to clean up my mailbox no need to make the task more harder! 
  </p>
