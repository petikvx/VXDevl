<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>It is quit usual, to include some interviews in the all the zines. As
we would like to be elite zine, we wanna have elite interviewz. :) </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Can you introduce yourselves ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, we're just a group of friends who knew themselves in a BBS, started
changing ideas and decided (me) to found a virus writing group and release
a virus magazine. Most of us are studying a career at the university, other
are in the military service, and the rest are studying at the school, very
near to start a career. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your relationship to girl, beer and another
lovely subjects </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hehe... well, my relationship with my girlfriend is ok, we even travelled
to India and live (sometimes) together in a flat of mine... we've been
going out for more than a year :) </P>

<P>About beer, i'm sorry, but i don't like it :) I don't like drinking,
i only do it in very special circumstances. Other lovely subjects could
be music, cinema, and, of course, computing and writing viruses. Anyway,
i don't have many free time, as i have a lot of exams and a lot of unreplied
BBS and Internet mail... i guess you know this situation :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When and why did you start to be interested
in computers ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I had my first experience with a 8088 bought by my brother, when i was
only 6 or 7. I didn't have any adaption process or shit like that, i just
liked computers since the first time i knew them. Anyway, i must say that
my first love was my first Macintosh :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your first contact with virus ... </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It was some time after buying my first Mac, with a virus called WDEF
with which there were some infected applications my brother brought from
his work. Anyway, it was also an AV contact, as i did a disinfection work
with an application called ResEdit (the equivalent in Mac OS for the debug.exe
of DOS) :) </P>

<P>Two years later, more or less, my PC got infected with the Traceback.3066
virus, and that's when i really got interested on viruses, albeit i could
not do any 'serious' work until i got a modem and downloaded more virus
stuff (especially virus magazines) from spanish underground boards. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about your first virus ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Heh... well, there were some projects. The first virus i coded was a
30-byte-more-or-less overwriting infector :) Later i wrote an appending
non-resident COM infector, later i tried the EXE infection, SYS files,
etc. And that's when i started combinating different kinds of infections
and inventing some new original stuff.<BR>
The boot/MBR thing came later, but that's something i never liked, dunno
why... this is... i can write a boot/MBR infector in two minutes, but i
don't like them at all; don't ask me the reason :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did u land in 29A staff ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, actually i never landed... it was the rest of the people who did
it :) We all used to interchange ideas and material via a spanish BBS called
Dark Node; one day i realised that we had enough stuff to release a zine,
and then i proposed it. Many people accepted, so we founded <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A>
and we started to work in order to release our first zine asap. </P>

<P>Anyway, in 29A there's no staff, there's just a boss who takes decissions
according to the opinion of the rest of the members, but there are no 'range'
differences between us. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Perspectives of polymorphism </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Polymorphism has some advantadges if we compare it with other viral
techniques such as stealth, for instance. There's no any unique routine
which mutates viruses, it's something very personal, more personal even
than a virus itself. So it depends on the imagination of a virus author
to write a powerful-supercomplex poly engine... anyway, right now we must
focus the slow poly stuff, as it's the unique way to fuck AVers and make
them worth of the money they earn. </P>

<P>And this last thing depends on the point of view of each virus author;
some of us bet for originality, other writers prefer to release their viruses
and see how long do they stay in the wild... so there's no any unique answer.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Perspectives of stealth </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Stealth is almost dead, it's the opposite thing to polymorphism. There
are very few stealth techniques, as everybody uses the ones which already
exist... they only vary a little if you mean full stealth, as it's something
which takes a bit more of time. </P>

<P>They work, so everybody uses them; they're very simple, so it's very
difficult to write something really original and special on them. Anyway,
Super (new 29A member!) has something to say about this ;) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">New systems (W95, NT OS/2 ) and viruses ...
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Since Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the earth right now, we must
assume that Windows (and i don't mean Windows95 or NT) is the future. Heh,
anybody could make all the people think that a crock of shit is good, and
even eat it... if he has the money Bill Gates has :) </P>

<P>Operating systems such as Linux, OS/2 and Mac OS are very good, but
they will die soon as the number of dickheads increases every day. Of course,
Windows95 won't be the definitive operating system... anyway, i think that
it's a positive thing to spend our time trying to find out more stuff about
PE infection under Windows95, as things won't change radically in a LOT
of time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Today I got a message about first virus under
Linux. What do you think about it </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Good news for the virus community, of course :) That's the second part
of the future... 50% will be Windows-dickheaded users, and 50% will be
Internet applications developers who will work under Linux/Unix with programming
languages such as Java. </P>

<P>Anyway, Linux is still a very 'rough' operating system which evolves
with very slow but firm steps into a definitive consistent alternative.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Virus as weapon ( bunch of paranoid geeks like
NSA,CIA,DIA,SIS 're asked to skip this question and answer) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It'd be very difficult to write such a virus (if you're expecting a
good success ratio), cause it'd have to be a slow infector... but not so
slow, cause it'd then leave more time for people to discover it. It'd a
good idea to copy itself into unusual places, either using the cavity infection
method or the Pascal/C trick used by Zhengxi and Lucretia. </P>

<P>There would be much more doubts about this, such as, for instance, wether
to be small (the virus) but with a stupid encryption, or to be around 10k
long, but encrypted with five highly polymorphic complex engines. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">As an Spanish dude, can you describe local
virus scene ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There's no scene besides 29A in Spain... there are many underground
boards, but almost all of them without any special relevance. The two most
important underground BBSs in Spain are Dark Node and Edison's Temple.
In both of them you can find a lot of virus writers, but most of them are
members of 29A, or just write a common virus from time to time. </P>

<P>It seems that hacking/phreacking is more popular here. In fact, Edison's
Temple is a hacking-oriented BBS, just ask Mr. White or Wintermute, two
of the most important persons there. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">The same stuff as previous but AV </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some time ago there was an antivirus called Skudo, written by a dood
from Barcelona called Jordi M=A0s. Anyway, it was designed for preventing
against viruses, not for detecting/disinfecting them. As its author left
Barcelona and now lives in France, we didn't know anything else about Skudo.
</P>

<P>There are some other 'pure' AV packages, such as Artemis, Panda, Oyster,
XScan, PC-Cillin, and so on, but they're just commercial shit (the typical
ignorant dickheads who claim that their antivirus detects over 9000 viruses
&lt;g&gt;, you know...). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your favourite virus and why </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Errrhmm... never had anything clear on this. I think i'd choose Zhengxi
as my favourite virus, as it's the most complex i've ever seen in my life,
and there are still lots of unexplored (commented tho) things on it which
can be used in other viruses. </P>

<P>It's original, it uses a very insidious infection way, it's the most
difficult virus to detect/disassemble, and its poly engine is *awesome*.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your favourite antivirus programm and why </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>AVP, of course. It's the most professional (well, i'd even say it's
the unique professional AV), very reliable, easy to use for lamers and
very flexible for gurus, it's the one which detects/disinfects more viruses,
and the unique AV which includes so necessary (and easy!) techniques such
as disinfecting known viruses in memory. Its code analyzer is the best,
and it's probably the most difficult AV to fool. Besides, i love AVPUtil
and AVPRO, two utilities of its registered version :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Vx coder you would like to meet personally
and why </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Dunno, this is probably the most difficult question. I think <A HREF="ivqark.htm">Qark</A>,
he's very funny, he's the virus writer i admire most, and i have a very
good relationship with him; of course, i'd like to meet other people i
admire a lot, such as <A HREF="ivquantm.htm">Quantum</A>, Stormbringer,
<A HREF="ivrajaat.htm">Rajaat</A>, Q the Misanthrope... who knows, there
are a lot. </P>

<P>All the 29Aers usually meet in Spain two or three times a year, and
we ave a lot of fun, we even bring computers to our meetings, so we can
execute/write viruses, and so on :) Of course, it would be very nice to
do an european VX meeting, that would be da freak! ;) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">AV people you would like to meet </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'd like to meet Kaspersky in order to discuss technical stuff... in
other to do other things, i'd rather choose Patty Hoffman, for masturbating
in her tits, Vesselin Bontchev, in order to suggest him a new haircut,
and Frans Veldman, for waking him up. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are there in Spain some laws against viruses
and their author? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There's just a law which forbids to modify/destruct any data, but there's
nothing against writing self-reproducting code and/or releasing it, you're
guilty only if you're the one who executes it intentionally. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think 'bout maniacs who want to
bust and prosecute us, the vx coders and would like to erase the vx scene
? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I call that envy. They can't just understand that the word 'virus' doesn't
imply 'destruction' necessarily, so they can't understand that many people
enjoy themselves writing viruses, just as other people do when they paint
pictures or watch TV. They'd probably like to know how to write viruses
without having to use VCL, but their morality forbids them to have any
kind of relationship or contact with people in the virus scene. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Your plans 4 the future as coder and in general
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Just to release a lot of highly succesful <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</A>
issues and to have more time to spend on doing the thing i like most: writing
viruses. Never mind if they work under DOS, Windows, Windows95 or GameBoy,
it's just to feel again the sensation of having written something really
original and interesting to the rest of the people. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Last but not least : can you point us to some
interestin' online resources on the internet ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, i'm not very used to navigate through the Internet, but anyway
i have some interesting addresses in my bookmark... </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.wcivr.com">http://www.wcivr.com</A> WCIVR (Falcon's

</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So thanks, Mister Sandman. Was very nice you
spending some time with this interview. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It was nice to answer all your questions, best luck with your magazine!
:) </P>

<P>Thanx a lot, dude... </P>
