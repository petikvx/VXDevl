  [August 1999]</font></P>
<hr>
<P>This is an interview with one of the best win32 coders out there, Jacky Qwerty. 
  Good luck at University, man!! </P>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">It is not everyday that people decide to go into 
  VX writing. What made you go on this path? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've been in contact with computers all my life, partly because my family 
    had been running a computer store for years. So my first steps into the computer 
    world went almost naturally. But it wasn't until I had my first contact with 
    a computer virus that I became completely curious, excited and crazy about 
    them. It was named "Tabulero", the very first file infector written in my 
    former country Venezuela. Shortly after, there appeared others as well like 
    Quiver and the infamous Dir2.Byway. But I was too young then and the "show" 
    wouldn't really start for me until some years later ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">When and how did you appear in the VX scene? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My first appearance in the VX scene occured shortly after the Concept virus 
    was big news. At that time I had already gotten some average knowledge in 
    programming languages like Qbasic, Pascal and C/C++, but my assembly skills 
    were not that good. So in a hurry I decided to take my chance in the macro 
    stuff world which seemed a very promising choice at that time. So I downloaded 
    everything I could find on the subject, and a few weeks later, I started to 
    write my own macro virus, WM.CAP, which I coded during a whole restless weekend 
    in December 1996. Shortly after, I met <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a>, 
    became one of its members, and the rest you know it well ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How did you choose your nickname? Did you use other 
  nicks before? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well I came up with my nick in a quite unusual but funny way. I remember 
    I made a short list borrowing them from game packs, cartoons from TV, etc, 
    but it didn't help much ;). One day, after one of my biggest yawns ever in 
    front of my blurred screen, my sleepy eyes quietly stood still looking at 
    the keyboard, and read the first words that had always been there without 
    noticing: "QWERTY". It didn't sound that bad, I thought, but it lacked something 
    else, so I simply added "Jacky", since my real first nam e begins in "J", 
    and it finally became "Jacky Qwerty", or "jqwerty" for short. I have never 
    used other nicks in the past, though. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Which are the main programming languages you use? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My favorite languages are C/C++ and ASM since I can have a lot of control 
    over a known environment with them, and I like that! However, I program some 
    other high level languages like Pascal, QBasic, Delphi, and also M$ visual 
    shitty stuff like VBasic, VC ++, etc. Recently however, I've been experimenting 
    with JAVA and Perl for internet based applications. But when it comes to interact 
    directly with the computer, I code much more fluently and faster in C/C++ 
    than in any other language including ASM. For optimal speed and size though, 
    ASM is the way to go. That's why most viruses are written in this language. 
    Not even the best High-Level Language optimizer can ever circumvent this ;-). 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where do you live and how is the situation of the 
  virus scene in your land ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I currently live in Peru since almost two years ago. My family and I had 
    to run away from Venezuela due to problems with justice - in short, we used 
    to sell pirated software, they caught us and took away most of our HW/SW equipment. 
    Regarding the virus situation in my former country, what can I say, it really 
    sucked. There seemed to be nobody there interested in viruses besides me, 
    or at least that's what I thought at first. </p>
  <p> However it wasn't until WM.CAP was big news that I knew I was somewhat wrong. 
    I started to receive emails from many virus writers all over the world, including 
    Venezuela - a big surprise for me indeed. None of them apparently knew about 
    each other's existence - a thing not so common in Venezuela, and a sketch 
    from the political situation there as well. Where TF had this people been 
    all this time !? I keep wondering ;-). </p>
  <p> In Peru however, the scene is a lot more active. There are plenty of youngsters 
    interested in different H/P/C/V topics, including of course virus programming. 
    Some notorious virus writers and very good friends of mine like Darkside (now 
    retired) and Kid Chaos/SLAM are from Peru. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Tell us something about your last projects, if any. 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Sure, I have some projects going on right now, but unfortunately (for some 
    enthusiasts) none of them are virus related. Some days ago I officially resigned 
    from 29A and retired from virus scene as well. A well-known ex-virus writer 
    once told me that all of us eventually get tired, bored and exhausted of virus 
    programming, so we finally retire looking for new interesting areas in which 
    to explore and research. And once we do, he said, it's very unlikely to ever 
    write a single line of virus code again. I think he can't be closer from the 
    truth. That's exactly what happened to me indeed. </p>
  <p> No, this doesn't mean I won't ever write a computer program again. Lately, 
    even though I have found myself greatly interested in other non-computer related 
    stuff, my computer related interests have also evolved and now comprise other 
    cool programming top ics as well, some more profitable - like JAVA and Perl 
    programming, and others posing quite different opportunities - like compression 
    and cryptography, for instance. As to what future holds, well I don't know 
    100%. It would be really boresome if we knew it all, don't you think? ;-). 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">You are a member of a VX group. Other groups you've 
  worked in/with? Are there particular goals you and your group want to achieve? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have never belonged to any other group besides 29A in the past. Before 
    29A, I was just a new independant virus writer, just born from the media and 
    the hype created by the CAP virus, now in imminent extinction. Perhaps a bit 
    of luck had something to do with it being a widespread threat and also with 
    my entrance in 29A. I remember I sent a quick email congratulating the whole 
    29A crew after their very first zine, and then I received replies back mostly 
    from Mrsandman and Tcp. We exchanged lots of ideas , mine having to do basically 
    with my independant research on Win32 (SEH, per-process residency, memory-mapping, 
    last section trick, etc.). Shortly after I was invited by Mrsandman to join 
    the 29A crew, I said why not, and so it was. </p>
  <p> Since the very beginning, 29A has had pretty much the same goals that most 
    other groups have had in the past: Programming the most technical top advanced 
    viruses ever, writing the best technical VX-related articles ever, and finally 
    spreading out all this knowledge farther. And even though we have come closer 
    and closer to this goal, there's still much road to go over of course. </p>
  <p> In addition, apart from these technical goals, one of the most full rewarding 
    experiences I've had with 29A and with others from the virus scene as well, 
    is perhaps those everlasting friendships that some of us developed during 
    email exchanges, IRC chats , phone calls and even personal encounters during 
    VX meetings. After all, what's really left when each of us eventually retires? 
    Surely not this or that kickass ultra virus technique, or that super metapoly 
    engine, it's perhaps all the friends you made w hat you will remember most 
    in the future. Because in spite of AVers opinions about VXers, there are people 
    in the VX scene with very high human quality that deserve to be remembered 
    as such. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you think that win32 programming will decrease 
  the number of virus authors out there? Will macro virii start to take over? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No, it's actually the opposite (imho). Win32 low level programming is increasing, 
    you can tell by the number of viruses and worms recently written specifically 
    for the Win32 platform. Win32.Cabanas started the Win9x-WinNT compatible virus 
    sequel, but it was shortly followed by other Win32 viruses as well. There 
    are also new emerging web pages about Win32 ASM programming, so Win32 is imminently 
    increasing, no doubt about it. </p>
  <p> As to whether it will outnumber Macro stuff or viceversa, that will be the 
    issue for years to come. That will depend greatly on M$ troglodytes of course. 
    However, independently of "virus" programming on either platform, I think 
    the M$ macro development in general, which is basically application dependant, 
    is much more fragile and can be interrupted easier than its Win32 counterpart, 
    which has obviously stronger roots since it's OS dependant. And even this 
    statement may be no longer true in the future as Micro$oft keeps adding scripting 
    language and embedding macro functionality in their OS's. Whatever stays, 
    virus writers will have plenty of platforms to choose from ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Would you like to do something else with computers 
  than viruses, like demos or hacking or anything like? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Of course, I had that in mind since the very beginning. Not only viruses 
    have got my attention. I have also found particular interest in other H/P/C/V 
    and compression/cryptography topics. It comes naturally: You only do one single 
    thing, you end up getting used to it and finally disliking it. Virus writers 
    shouldn't be virus writers only. They should be "programmers" long before 
    being virus writers, in that strict order. There are slight and extreme exceptions 
    to this rule of course. </p>
  <p> For instance, lamers who come to ACV or IRC and say "I wanna write a virus 
    and fuck up a HD real bad..", are nothing but childish kids who never manage 
    to write a single virus ever, they will always be wannabes, with no evident 
    intention to research, evolve or code something original throughout their 
    miserable lives - tough but true. However it's also true that some virus writers 
    never reach to be "true" programmers as well. And that happens if they dedicate 
    solely to virus programming only. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Are there things or people you dislike within the 
  VX ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Yes, I really dislike certain god-alike attitudes that some virus writers 
    show towards other "human beings". For instance, when they manage to write 
    viruses that effectively escape into the wild. I have met virus writers that 
    change dramatically their behavior once this happens, as if saying "Ok I'm 
    no longer a newbie, and you're no longer my master". I just laugh and say 
    to myself "Gee he has the god-psyndrome" ;-). </p>
  <p> I also hate selfish, unfriendly, arrogant attitudes sometimes evidenced 
    by persons, VX-related or not, I have never known or heard about, but who 
    suddenly drop me unexpected emails or appear on IRC with such childish offensive 
    attitude. At first, I explain my reasons to them, that I simply do it for 
    fun, etc. But after a while you get used to it, you no longer give explanations, 
    you simply ignore them - i.e. you kick/ban them ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What makes you choose the names of your viruses? 
  Give some examples... </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have no written rule for that. Sometimes I name a virus after a good friend 
    of mine, as in the Win32.Cabanas virus. Other times I choose a name of a person 
    I dislike, as in the WM.CAP virus. And at other times I simply name a virus 
    according to some funny story or anecdote that makes me laugh, as in the DogPaw 
    or Numbless virus, etc. At other times I don't even choose the name, AVers 
    do, as in the Win95.Jacky virus ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Does the VX have an influence on your life/friends 
  ? Has it changed ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I have tried to carry both virus programming and my personal life apart 
    from each other. So far it has worked. Neither my relatives nor my closest 
    friends would ever suspect about me, a guy who in real life never talks about 
    his predilect H/P/C/V topics to anybody except him and his computer. Moreover, 
    I obtained my bachelor's degree in a completely different area other than 
    programming or computer science related stuff. Because of that, my life didn't 
    really change dramatically at the time my nickname began to irritate users 
    and AVers out there ;-). </p>
  <p> I just took everything smoothly and naturally as it happened. Of course, 
    I enjoyed a lot that secret virtual part of me, as much in the same way as 
    in real life I still enjoy doing other sort of things normal people usually 
    do - go to the movies, chat in a cafe, going to parties, etc. But regarding 
    virus related issues, hey I'd better keep that to myself. The dark side of 
    me, if you prefer. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What are your favorite stuffs in the VX field (virus, 
  author, engine, etc...) Is there one virus you like most, due to its originality/complexity? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some viruses come to mind: The "Byway" virus had a strong influence over 
    me. I remember I disassembled it from top to bottom and learned a lot from 
    it. It was a imminent threat in my former country and it spread wildly like 
    most Dir-2 viruses did during their lifetime. "Natas" was also quite an advanced 
    bug, with strong poly, full stealth, etc, but its author seemed to have no 
    creativity at all for a good payload, same as "Hare" and all other destructive 
    viruses. </p>
  <p> I also liked "OneHalf" very much, as it was an exception to the rule. Its 
    author had the idea of addicting the computer to the virus by encrypting the 
    hard disk and decrypting it on the fly, which it's not destructive by itself. 
    It also enhanced the "Com mander Bomber" infection which addicted infected 
    files to the virus as well. In short, OneHalf was (imho) far more ingenious 
    than Hare or Natas. It's quite curious how the so called "effective" AV programs 
    were the real "destructors", while not being able to handle this and other 
    viruses properly. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">How would you consider the perfect virus? ;-) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> There ain't such thing as a perfect virus, anyway such virus would have 
    to be completely undetectable and untraceable by all means, with full stealth 
    capabilities in both memory and files, slowly polymorphic, with fast infection 
    features, multipartite, a ble to infect MBRs, boot sectors and multiple file 
    formats as well: DOS/MZ files, Win16/NE files, Win32/PE files, OS/2/LX files, 
    OLE2/DOC/XLS files, Linux/ELF files, OBJ/LIB OMF/COFF files, ZIP, ARJ, RAR, 
    CAB, LZH compressed files etc, etc. It would also have to work on different 
    platforms (Linux, MacOS, OS/2, Win3.1, Win9x, WinNT, etc.) This virus would 
    have to be as small as possible and as bug-free as could be. A bit difficult 
    for any virus with so much features like this one, but you asked, heh ;-). 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What do you think about destructive viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It was perhaps the fact that I had a very bad experience with "Natas" virus 
    - we lost a whole hard disk at the comp store - that I got a bit paranoid 
    about destructive code. I really don't like at all any kind of destructive 
    rubbish in any form or means, including in a virus, trojan horse, worms, etc. 
    I disagree with people who write destructive code (file deletion, disk formatting, 
    etc.) for the simple reason that I know for myself how harmful such destructive 
    code can be. However I wrote viruses since I have a different opinion on what 
    a virus is ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">All along the virus history and the VX scene itself, 
  which "original" viruses deserve to be reminded and why? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well I think those viruses which proposed new infection ideas, new means 
    of memory residency, new infectable file formats, etc. deserve to be reminded 
    somewhat along the whole virus history. I could name a few: "Jerusalem" - 
    said to be the first file infector, though I doubt it, "Brain" - said to be 
    the first boot sector virus ever, the bulgarian viruses: "Number of the Beast" 
    - for being the first "full stealth" infector, the "Dark Avenger" virus - 
    the first fast infector and the "Dir-2" virus - for having developed a new 
    original infection technique. "Commander Bomber" follows - for its kickass 
    approach of inserting chunks of virus code all along the host, also "Concept" 
    and "DMV" - for being the first macro viruses ever, etc. I know there are 
    quite a lot more advanced bugs that deserve to be mentioned as well, but damnit, 
    I'm far from being a rolling virus enciclopedia ;-). </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Do you want to make an appeal to anyone? (beginners, 
  ex-writers, whole scene) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Beginners: Please don't write intentionally destructive code.<br>
    Ex-writers: I'm coming aboard, erm my fingers just start to rust.. Whole scene: 
    Hot than ever before. <br>
    Groups/Independants: make it worth! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">What else do you do when you aren't coding a virus 
  ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I currently work for a big Telecoms company. I spend all morning, noon and 
    part of the afternoon working for the project management team. Curiously I 
    seldom sit in front of a computer ;-), except when I have to write down those 
    bored reports for my boss, or those excel sheets, etc. </p>
  <p> However, in spite of my stressful job, I find time most afternoons after 
    work to go mountain biking in the Peruvian Andes with my friends from the 
    old mountain bike team at Uni. I find this activity very pleasant and healthy 
    for my brain and lungs, so I practice it at least twice a week. </p>
  <p> I also find time most nights for my pretty girlfriend Carol, to help her 
    with her undergrad studies in psychology, mostly with her statistical and 
    maths related courses. Most weekends however, we go out with some friends 
    to the movies, discos, or just chat in a cybercafe bar for a while. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Where can you be reached ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I still can be contacted through my email address: <a href="mailto:jqwerty@cryogen.com">jqwerty@cryogen.com</a>. 
    If I delay too much in replying it's perhaps because I am specially hurried 
    those days, or maybe you asked a very stupid/obvious question that deserves 
    no answer at all, or probably you asked a virus related question. Please remember 
    I'm retired. That means no virus related questions. There are plenty of Win32 
    coders better than me nowadays. Visit the official Win32 ASM Programming homepage 
    for some of them. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080">Any greetings ? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> 29A: Hey you have strong competition here: <a href="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</a>! 
    Lord Julus: Perhaps in the next eclipse? ;-) SLAM: Keep up the good work buddies! 
    VX scene: Keep the scene alive! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <font color="#004080"><b>Any final word? </b></font></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I want to thank the SLAM team specially Lord Julus for this great opportunity. 
    I'm glad to see how the SLAM team has evolved from being solely a macro VX 
    related zine to what it is today: a highly active and heterogeneous virus 
    team with very talented virus coders. Keep it up! </p>
  <p> Jacky Qwerty.- </p>
