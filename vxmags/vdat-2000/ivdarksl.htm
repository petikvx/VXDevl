<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What made you choose the name Dark Slayer? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>After reading an article called 'Introducing Dark Avenger and Dark Angel'
on magazine, I realize that I need a cool name like theirs. When I was
thinking and listening the Slayer's CD ( a Metal Band ), suddently I found
'Slayer ' cool enough. That's why I called ' Dark Slayer '. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Could you give us a short description of yourself?
(age, hobbies, study/work etc) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am a 19 years old boy. I like swimming, playing basketball, listening
Heavy Metal, playing Computer, reading novel and so on. I am a college
student and my major course is electrical engineer. I live in dorm. Although
I called 'Dark Slayer' but I never write any destructive virus. To me,
writing virus is just for research and fun. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How many years have you been coding ASM? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>About 3 years. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you know any other languages? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes! I can write C, Basic and 8048 micro-assembly. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What have you written so far? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I only wrote about 10-15 viruses so for. They are MacGyver ( 1.0a, 1.0b,
2.0, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0 ), Connie I/II, Ray Gong ( This is the only boot virus
I wrote), New 512 ( or DS-512 ), Skid-Row ( version A, B, C; C version
can infect files via directly HD I/O ), Assassin ( first version and BugFixed
version) and two engine ( <A HREF="engine1.htm#DSME">DSME v1.0</A>, <A HREF="engine1.htm#DSCE">DSCE
v1.0</A> ). The other virii for testing purpose are unnamed. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What made you write these programs? (also what
made you learn assembly?) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The reason made me to write virus is: I love to fool others. I bought
a book called 'Introduce to Assembly' and started to study it.<BR>
Finally I wrote my first virus, an over-written virus. When I studied more
and more technique, I was attracted in writing virus. Writing virus has
so many tricks like polymorphic, hidden, compress/decompress and so on
( ex: DIR-2, 512, Phoenix... ) that I can't ask myself stop writing. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is the virus scene in Taiwan? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In fact, virus writers in Taiwan are not so many than you though. We
don't like you guys (espically guys in U.S.) have many free time for writing
virus. We have thousands of homework to study. :(<BR>
In Taiwan, AV writers are as many as virii writers, but most of their products
like shit. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever been involved in any groups?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I had organized a group once. My group didn't have so many virus writer.
This caused my group smaller and smaller. :( I am the only one in this
group. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are there any virus laws in Taiwan? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm not familier with law, but I heard there are some law about virus
writing. By now, I haven't heard any one busted. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you spread your own programs? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I put my virus into some shareware/pd espically anti-virus program and
then I upload the file to BBS. This will cause my virii spread soon. Most
of my virii will infect one executable file when you are using it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Who is your favourite virus coder? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like `Dark Avenger. When I began to study virus , he is my aim. Espically
his <A HREF="engine1.htm#MTE">Mutation Engine</A>, it really cool. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do viruses travel fast in Taiwan? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Viruses spread so soon 'cause Taiwan is a small island. :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which anti-virus product do you think is the
best? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think TBAV is so not bad although its holes are so many. Many people
don't like it, but I think it really good. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are there any greets you want to give, or anything
else you want to say? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like Slash Wu. ( He is a virus writer in Taiwan. ) This guy
In fact, his stuff are not technique enough. You can say that <A HREF="engine1.htm#GPE">GPE
1.0</A> is copied from DSME 1.0 . He always said how good his virii is
and how suck my stuff is. Sometimes he act just like a AV writer and let
you though he is a good guy. </P>

to your windows virus!!!<BR>
