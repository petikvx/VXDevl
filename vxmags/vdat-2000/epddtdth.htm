 This is for all you, friends. DDT forever!
</P>
<P> <b>[ Introduction ] </b></P>
<P>
 As you  know, DDT is  dead. Although  i don't  know if ThE_WiZArD  continues
 carrying the DDT label, i consider it dead  as a group. And that makes me to
 feel sadness. You are wondering now why such a promising  group, as we were,
 is dead. How could it happen? Why? Ok, let me tell you the whole (but short)
 DDT history.
</P>
<P> <b>[ Why, when and how DDT appeared? ] </b></P>
<P>
 Well, this is going to appear in a book soon (hey SyS, lo acabas o no?), but
 anyway i think it should be interesting for you to know it.
</P>
<P> Personally, i always wanted to write a virus, since i've read the interview 
  published in PCMANIA with Wintermute and Mister Sandman, and about <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a>, 
  and all the virus descriptions in this same magazine fascinated me. </P>
<P> The story began in October of 1997, a long time ago. After our school mate 
  JuaNJo downloaded (he was the only one of us that had inet) some virus related 
  material, such as <a href="creatrs1.htm#IVP">IVP</a>, <a href="creatrs1.htm#G2">G2</a>, 
  <a href="creatrs2.htm#NRLG">NRLG</a>, some Hacking/Phreaking/Bomb-making stuff, 
  and passed it to zAxOn and me, we began to be interested in writing some undergroung 
  material. I had an idea in my mind: create a viruswriting group, such as <a href="groups2.htm#NUKE">NuKE</a>, 
  <a href="groups2.htm#YAM">YAM</a> and 29A were (hey, don't blame me. We only 
  knew that three groups!), but i was afraid to tell it to zAxOn, because he'd 
  laugh on me, as always. But i finally commented it to him, but i've never expected 
  his answer: "oh, shit, i've thought the same as you. It could be nice!".<a name="NOP"></a><br>
  So, i, with my knowledge of Pascal, and him, with his little knowledge of assembler, 
  tried to write our first thing: <a href="creators.htm">a virus creator</a>. 
  JuaNJo was included in the group because he's a very close friend to zAxOn and 
  me, and thanx to him we had some access to the contents of the net. Also we 
  included Johnny Mnemonic in the list, but he had no idea even of use his computer 
  (and still he doesn't know to do some others things like HTML code and play 
  videogames), but he passed us Carmageddon, and we had to include him here.<br>
  The first thing that was born was the interface of the program, written by me. 
  It was nice, with some bitmapped satanic fonts (unreadable!), such as NRLG ones, 
  but even more radical. It was also menu-based, but not as <a href="creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</a>. 
  It was black (i like that color) with a menu in the left middle in the screen 
  (a'la <a href="ezines1.htm#IR">IRG#8</a>). After i've done it, i took all the 
  code of it and went to zAxOn's home to write together the virus engines. It 
  took us one weekend to rip most of the IVP code, adapt it, change some parts, 
  and add many payloads. As i didn't knew how the hell to code in ASM, zAxOn done 
  it for me. Also, some other routines were ripped from NRLG. Don't blame, yes, 
  we know it was lame, but see... I was 14 and zAxOn was 15... So, what the fuck 
  you expect? Well, the virus generator was finished, and we called it <a href="creatrs2.htm#NOPVC">NOP 
  ViRUS CREATOR 0.666</a> (we didn't knew that there was a group called NoP). 
  It had some cool things in the interface, such as very nice copper bars going 
  up and down in the goodbye screen, some political messages inside the program 
  (what do you expect of me? i can't avoid it!). It was, and will never be released 
  to the public. As we were growing up in coding, i started to write the interface 
  for the second version of the virus creator, the NOP 1.666. But our plans were 
  fucked up, as in Christmas, zAxOn failed 6 subjects (imagine his parents, he 
  never had failed any subject in his life). So, his parents punished him. I was 
  alone in the coding. Anyway, i built a very very good new interface for the 
  new program, with some graphical stuff, such as fire, bump mapping, pictures, 
  fadings, etc. As i knew a bit of assembler, i coded many different payloads 
  for the virus. The interface had some windows, was able to save your settings, 
  it still had some political messages :) The most important, the virus engine, 
  was taken from <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29A#1</a>, Wintermute's Apocalyptic 
  virus. As you know, that virus is a TSR COM/EXE size-stealth virus. I modified 
  a bit the source, gave many greets to Winter (although i didn't knew him), and 
  finished it, alone. It was a great mental exercice. Just after it, i wrote a 
  brand new interface for the NOP 2.666. This virus generator was never finished. 
  But still, you can see its interface in <a href="ezines1.htm#DDT">DDT#1</a>, 
  as it's the same (KME!). We began to give our first steps in the real virus 
  coding. We kicked Johnny because his lameness, he didn't wanted to collaborate 
  in anything, or learn. So,we focused our coding skills in writing the NOP 2.666 
  virus engines by ourselves. The project was very ambitious. While i've written 
  the runtime engines and the TSR ones, zAxOn wrote a polymorphic engine for NOP, 
  called <a href="engine2.htm#ZPE">zPe (zAxOn's Polymorphic Engine)</a>. As i 
  was a bit bored of the project, i began to write my Antichrist Superstar. zAxOn 
  helped me with its encryption. The virus was a TSR COM/EXE with antidebug/antibait/retro/antiheuristic/antiemulator/antitbclean, 
  size- stealth, and some other features i am not able to remember. Meanwhile, 
  zAxOn was giving his firsts steps in Win32 ASM programming. I've written also 
  a poly engine, <a href="engine2.htm#XFME">X-FME (X-Files Mutation Engine).</a> 
  Also, i wrote my <a href="tumisc60.htm">Virus Writing Guide,</a> version 1.00. 
  The group idea was working ok. I've written a little test of a magazine for 
  the group, with all our current stuff, called ROL#1 (Rebels Of Leather magazine). 
  But as we had a lack of stuff (we were only 2 coders), we didn't published it. 
  Also, the NOP 2.666 project was dormant. And here came to our lives Internet. 
  After 3 months earning money (in my case; zAxOn had already a modem) i bought 
  a Diamond SupraExpress modem 56k. It was our first big step. With both us connected, 
  the project of DDT would be a reality. As i am a sucker, and at that time i 
  seeked for fame,i applied both 29A (MrSandman rejected me) and iKX (also rejected 
  me and didn't answered my emails). so, i realized that my place was at DDT, 
  and we had to make it to be a good group, and demonstrate everyone that any 
  group, with hard work, coudl do very good things. </P>
<P> <b>[ DDT grew up: new members, appears in the media... ] </b></P>
<P> I labeled myself as organization of the group (zAxOn agreed), so it was my 
  task. In one of the ussual netsplits of undernet's #vir channel i met with DuSTFaeRie, 
  a 16 year old french coder, that was interested in viruses and demoscene. He 
  had a TSR COM infector, and i asked him to join. He did! The group was formed 
  by 3 16 year old guys (zAxOn, JuaNJo and DuST), and a 15 year old kid (me!). 
  After uploading our first webpage, in xoom (at the same address where i have 
  my personal web now), and VirusBuster put it in his links, Cicatrix interviewed 
  zAxOn and me. We were grewing up step by step. I've met with a wonderful guy 
  called SeptiC, that was 17 year old, and was member at that time of JVS. He 
  asked him to join. He did, but anyway he decided to leave us 2 days after. After 
  some months in IRC, and asking many people for join and/or contributing, happened 
  the thing that marked a the before and after of the group. I asked some time 
  ago many times ThE_WiZArD to join us, but he always ignored me ;) Well, one 
  day i connected and suddendly VirusBuster told me "Hey, i'm a new member of 
  DDT, and ThE_WiZArD is too". Fuck! What a point! One of the most respected, 
  loved, and known VXers joined DDT!. What two additions! So, the viewpoint of 
  many people about the group changed. We passed from being one of those heap 
  of unproductive groups that only chat in the IRC to be a serious one. In my 
  case, i was lost in the coding of my Win95.Garaipena, zAxOn was coding his Win95.Auryn, 
  and giving form to great ideas, and all was going ok. </P>
<P> Some days after joining, VirusBuster changed his status inside the group as 
  collaborator, although he had all the privileges of a member, for rejoin 29A 
  (he asked me for do it before, and i agreed). </P>
<P>
 We implanted the democracy in the group, all our  decissions since here were
 made voting.
</P><P>
 I continued searching for  new members. A french guy called Mandragore asked
 for contribute. He sent two viruses,  Replay II and  Glaurung v2.0. I  asked
 him for  join, and  he agreed, and all the  DDT members answered  YES to his
 apply. So, here was  another impressive  coder in our group! It was growing!
</P><P>
 Here came our  media apparitions,  in the  most famous spanish paper-printed
 magazines. They all  described us as a  very promising group, with a name in
 the world's virus scene (damn, it was true!). 
</P>
<P> The joining of Ypsilon was similar to ThE_WiZArD's one. I asked him many times 
  to join, as Super told me how good he is. He always replied to me "Let me think 
  about it". But after many asks by my side, he said "Why not?". All the members 
  also agreed, so he became a member, although i lost communication with him since 
  there. </P>
<P> Some people helped us in our way to the elite, mainly were 29A and <a href="groups1.htm#FS">Feathered 
  Serpents</a>. 29A helped us letting me publish an intro to DDT in 29A#3, and 
  with a lot of contribution from their members to DDT#1, and Owl, the leader 
  of FS commented me about the Feathered Serpents Alliance idea, we all agreed 
  with it, and DDT became part of the powerful FSA. </P>
<P> <b>[ DDT#1: the group impresses the scene, and my own decay begins ] </b></P>
<P>
 We were developing an impressive piece of work with our first e-zine. Indeed
 it was the best first e-zine  of a  group  ever, because our hard work. But,
 some months before publish it (in January) happened  the thing  that was the
 main reason of my decay as organizer, and as DDT member:after two impressive
 phone bills (over $500 both two), my  neurotic  mother  cutted litterally my
 connection to  the net. Fuck. That was  the  beginning of a hard time to me.
 I passed the control of  the group  to zAxOn's hands. But my  life situation
 turned againist me:my vice (IRC) fucked up my studies,i failed two subjects,
 and many other  problems appeared (imagine it, and its consequences).  So, i
 had to think  about my  situation. For me, DDT was screwing  my  real  life.
 There wasn't any  other solution i could think of: if i don't leave it, it'd
 screw up my access to the  university. Of  course, my coding activity, after
 finish my two first released viruses (Win95.Garaipena, and Win95.Iced Earth)
 decreased  a lot, in  order  to pass  the exams (that were very near). Also,
 i thought that all the  stuff we had for DDT#1 was enough, so i mailed it to
 ThE_WiZArD for let him to upload it in his web (as our SOK address was down)
 So, he done it, and that's what appeared. DDT was over for me. 
</P>
<P> <b>[ What happened to DDT after Billy's departure? ] </b></P>
<P>
 As i have a very close relation with zAxOn, i knew what was happening to the
 group. I planned to let it in the hands of zAxOn,but instead him, ThE_WiZArD  
 took care of the group, and asked  to all the members if they would continue
 after DDT#1. As far as  i know, DuST, Mandragore, zAxOn and JuaNJo said that
 they would leave. I don't know what  happened with  Ypsilon, but i know he's
 not in the group now, so  i  guess he  left too. So, ThE_WiZArD was the only
 one. I think he left too.
</P><P>
 I wasn't a good end  for a very promising  virus group. Fuck,  if i've known
 that they all would leave, i wouldn't left. However, everyone can still take
 a look to the wonderful and impressive DDT#1. 
</P>
<P> <b>[ What happened to Billy? ] </b></P>
<P> 
 Luckily, after i passed  the exams, everyone went  good, so i  could be able
 again to code, and the summer was there for let me code even more. I had the
 offer of iKX and i accepted it. And here i am.
</P>
<P> <b>[ What happened to the rest of DDT? ] </b></P>
<P>
 JuaNJo is still carrying its life (if we can say he has a "life" ;), copying
 CDs to every lifeform around, getting games even 1 month before its release,
 getting OS betas for free, etc ;)
</P><P>
 zAxOn left the whole idea of virus coding, after releasing only two viruses,
 including the first PE infector that a  member of DDT wrote, and the world's
 ever first CorelDraw virus. He's  working right  know in  strange  things in
 C related to neural nets, and, btw, he doesn't have installed Windows in any
 of his 2 computers, he only uses LiNUX.
</P><P>
 DuSTFaeRie is still coding demos.
</P><P>
 Ypsilon is still working in  earn more  and more money, fucking with his gf,
 and trying to make his VAS to work in SP4 :)
</P><P>
 About ThE_WiZArD and Mandragore i don't know anything (hey, mail me!)
</P><P>
 Sadly, another group died.
