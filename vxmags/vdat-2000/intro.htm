<blockquote> 
  <p>Welcome to this release of VDAT. A lot has happened during and since the 
    last release and with this editorial I will elaborate on the why and how of 
    what happened. </p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">The start:</font></b> </p>
  <p>VDAT has existed in one form or another since August 1995. It started out 
    as an "see if I can do this" exercise of arranging diskettes full of viral 
    information into one coherent, easily accessible file. This information was 
    a by-product of my main activity, collecting computer viruses. It still is 
    my main activity today although I sometimes find that VDAT uses a lot of the 
    available spare time. </p>
  <p>I am the first to acknowledge that the first couple of releases were pretty 
    lame but I think I managed to improve the product with every release. Somewhere 
    during this process I decided that the DOS hypertext version I was releasing 
    was just not good enough for some of the graphic features I wanted to include. 
    Also it was a pain in the butt to update. </p>
  <p>When I started looking for an equivalent Windows based hypertext tool I came 
    across a small database created with InfoCourier. After trying out the trial 
    version for some time I concluded that using HTML was not only easy but a 
    lot of HTML editing tools were available which made updating VDAT a lot less 
    complicated. So I bought (no kidding) the full version of InfoCourier and 
    started the conversion of VDAT for DOS to VDAT for Windows. </p>
  <p>Version 1.9 for DOS and version 1.0 for Windows were each other's equivalent 
    and although some people asked me to maintain a DOS version soon I noticed 
    keeping both updated was just not feasible and I decided to discontinue the 
    DOS version. </p>
  <p>In the mean time the "phenomenon" of VDAT was finding it's way to more users, 
    both in the VX scene and the among the general computer user. Most reactions 
    I got were supportive and many people supplied me with material I could use 
    for VDAT. </p>
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>Collecting:</b></font> </p>
  <p>While keeping VDAT updated I was still very much into collecting viruses. 
    The same way I wanted my viral information to be "organized" I had a system 
    of collecting viruses. For my own purposes I created small subcollections 
    that were often built around one single subject, either a particular VX group 
    or a some specific virus technology like polymorphic engines. When I started 
    making these collections available through a limited access website a lot 
    of people contacted me with either requests or offers for trade. </p>
  <p>Originally my main supply for new viruses were well known VX BBS'es like 
    Arrested Development, Chiba City, Black Axis and WCIVR. With the spread of 
    Internet and the World Wide Web computer viruses were readily available for 
    anyone who knew where and how to look. </p>
  <p>All this created a nice flow of new stuff that allowed me to release updates 
    to my collections every once in a while. Although these collections and their 
    updates were created for my own purposes many fellow collectors and maybe 
    some newbie virus writers seem to enjoy them too. After a period of limited 
    access I decided to make everything I produced available to whoever wanted 
    it although I found that 10 Mb was not enough to run a satisfying website. 
    My ISP during that period was very "open" about all this and I never had any 
    complaints or requests to remove my virus files even though I had expected 
    them. </p>
  <p>Since I had a "normal" job too and all this computer virus collecting was 
    just a hobby not a lot of time was left to give my website the look I wanted 
    it to have. All over the Web new virus sites popped up and died out, most 
    with better looks than mine had. For a while the WCIVR had a gigantic number 
    of computer viruses available for download, initially for free later they 
    started using ratios. These were the fun times for collecting viruses. </p>
  <p>All my efforts of keeping my collections, my website and VDAT updated were 
    decreasing the available time for keeping my virus collection up to date. 
    Although I still collected viruses I could find no time to ID, scan and organize 
    them properly. Also the increasing numbers of different viruses played havoc 
    with my initial method of organizing my collection, it was all very time consuming. 
  </p>
  <p>Although most reactions to my efforts were positive the number of negative 
    reactions was increasing. Apparently some people felt that their intellectual 
    property was violated when I decided to include some of their material in 
    one of my collections. The lack of time, the collection that was in disarray, 
    the effort of updating an unsatisfying website, the lack of available webspace 
    and the increasing number of negative reactions caused me to rethink my goals. 
    After an interim period of a website with only VDAT available I decided to 
    fully pull the plug. The only thing I was going to release publicly in the 
    future was VDAT and that would have its own website. Contrary to what most 
    people thought the negative reactions were not the sole reason for me quitting 
    my site, they were just the last straw. </p>
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>Post website:</b></font> </p>
  <p>In the wake of all this I was flooded with e-mail and although I must say 
    all of them were supportive some thought I was "giving in" and that I should 
    "stand up" to the negative reactions. Like I mentioned the above, these reactions 
    were not the main reason just the straw that broke the camel's back. </p>
  <p>After the demise of my main website I finally had some time to rearrange 
    my virus collection. While doing so I found out that the lack of attention 
    to my collection had caused me to fall behind in the numbers of viruses I 
    had collected and I frantically looked for the missing material. Luckily some 
    of my more solid contacts from the past came through and helped me out bringing 
    my collection back up to speed. </p>
  <p>The main emphasis of my hobby is again collecting viruses and a by-product 
    is the continued release of VDAT. My <a href="collect.htm">subcollections 
    and their updates</a> have stopped, maybe not forever but certainly for the 
    near future. If they ever are reinstated they will not be available to the 
    general collector but only to a select few. </p>
  <p>In the years I have been collecting viruses I have never been a member of 
    a group. I always thought that maintaining the "middle-of-the-road" and being 
    an independent produced the best results. Being a member of a particular group 
    tends to limit access to work from another group. After the death of my website 
    I found that at a certain point in one's virus collection it is impossible 
    to add a substantial number of new viruses without being part of a certain 
    traders world. That is why I decided for, and requested, membership of VTC 
    (Virus Trading Center), the only such group around. Many of the members I 
    knew from the past and although some have been members of virus writing groups 
    none are actively producing viruses. I must say that it was a good move, the 
    exchange of new virus material is solid and worthwhile. </p>
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>Future: </b></font></p>
  <p>So with my collection back on rails I found time again for this release of 
    VDAT. VDAT also will need some changes in the future and I have been thinking 
    about many possibilities. One of them is the use of the successor to InfoCourier 
    called WebCompiler 98. Made by the same author and company as InfoCourier 
    WebCompiler makes a big jump in available features, e.g. the use of frames, 
    animated graphics and many more exciting possibilities. Something I wanted 
    to do for this VDAT, a virus graphics gallery, will be postponed until the 
    WebCompiler version because of that. Also the final compiled product is faster 
    (it is 32 bit) and smaller than its predecessor. All of this of course comes 
    for a price and some of you will call it a drawback. <br>
    WebCompiler 98 is largely based on the Internet Explorer 4 core engine and 
    because of that will require the user to have one of the following software 
    configurations: Windows 95 + IE4, Windows 98, Windows NT4 + IE4 or Windows 
    NT5 (Windows 2000). I know this will go against the grain of a lot of people 
    that are not exactly supporters of anything containing the Microsoft logo 
    so I have not made up my mind yet. Maybe I will create two versions (16 bit 
    and 32 bit) but that would just be a repeat of the DOS version and the initial 
    Windows version tale. <br>
    Except for WebCompiler 98 I have not found a worthy successor to InfoCourier 
    and I think that in the HTML world of today frames, animated graphics and 
    other fancy features are a must. So just like computer viruses are moving 
    to the 32-bit plane I think VDAT will eventually migrate to the same plane. 
    This might cause some users to turn their backs on VDAT just because their 
    software does not support it anymore but I'm sure they will follow later on. 
  </p>
  <p>Another wish I have had since the initial release of the HTML version of 
    VDAT is a web version of the program. It would be very easy to transfer VDAT 
    to a website since everything is in HTML anyway. There are a couple of reasons 
    why it has not happened. The uncompiled size of VDAT is approaching 13 Mb 
    on its way to 14 Mb and it is hard to find free web space that size. Also 
    some of the contents of VDAT will be considered too explicit by some webspace 
    providers. Viral technology is still frowned upon or even considered illegal 
    in some parts of this world. Maybe somewhere in the future I will find a generous, 
    open-minded provider that will allow the online version of VDAT to be posted. 
    Until that time the compiled version will have to do. </p>
  <p>This concludes my rant about some of the things that happened the last couple 
    of months, I hope I have cleared things up a little for all of you that still 
    had questions. Feel free to e-mail me with questions, positive or even negative 
    suggestions for either VDAT or collecting computer viruses in general. </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+3" color="#FF8040">Release 1.8</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">April 1st, April Fools Day.</font></b> </p>
  <p>But regardless of that a new release of VDAT. A lot a new information has 
    been added and as I predicted, VDAT is getting bigger and bigger. I have had 
    some reactions and suggestions regarding this size issue. One of them suggested 
    deleting many of the lame and ripped off tutorials which, I agree, would reduce 
    the size of the final product quite a bit. The same person suggested deleting 
    interviews with &quot;morons which haven't done shit for the scene&quot;. 
    I must say I agree to a large extent with his views on the quality of <font color="#FF8040">some</font> 
    of the material addressed. But it is not my intent to make VDAT some kind 
    of Master Tutorial for which I will apply some quality filter to new material. 
    As I explained many times before, VDAT is a database of computer virus related 
    material. That means good or bad, right or wrong, grammatically correct or 
    not, anything can be included. One filter I <font color="#FF8040">do </font>apply 
    is version related. I will update material like Wildlists or other specific 
    material that is updated regularly. This applies to material that is of no 
    use when newer information is available. I know there are some grey (or gray 
    depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on) areas but than it is easy, 
    in the end there is only one person that determines what will be in VDAT and 
    you all know who that is.</p>
  <p>Something I want to reitterate is that VDAT is not meant to rob anyone, VX 
    or AV, of their intellectual property. It is meant solely as a database of 
    virus scene facts. Where possible I leave names of authors or origins in place 
    for all to read. I'm not looking to take credit for someone else's work. </p>
  <p>VDAT should be available online (on a trial basis) at http://c5.hakker.com/vdat. 
    The online version reflects compiled version 1.7 and should be identical. 
    The intent is NOT to update the online version between compiled releases, 
    that would mean too much effort and spare time I do not have. Also as of compiled 
    version 1.8 the online version will always lag one release. This is done to 
    leave some incentive to get the latest version, don't ask me why, it doesn't 
    make me any richer but it is what I want to do.</p>
  <p>Recently members of <a href="tradgrps.htm#VTC">VTC</a> have been actively 
    looking for additional material like specific virus engines, kits and tools 
    that were either not in their collection or not in VDAT. Some &quot;WANTED&quot; 
    lists have been passed around and I must say that the initial response was 
    promising. So if you have some viral material (engines, kits, tools) that 
    is on the WANTED list or something that is NOT included in VDAT contact one 
    of the <a href="tradgrps.htm#VTC">VTC</a> members and we will make it worth 
    your while. For a recent WANTED list visit Tally's Virus Link Reference at 
    <a href="http://www.coderz.net/tally/">http://www.coderz.net/tally</a>.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>And one more is released.</b></font></p>
  <p>VDAT is not perfect, far from it. Every day I or someone else catch some 
    kind of error or untruth. Apparently people like VDAT to be accurate, as do 
    I. So if you know something that could help increase the accuracy do not hesitate 
    to contact me, preferably via e-mail. One example of such an inaccuray might 
    be the interview with someone posing as the author of the CIH virus. Although 
    I can not find hard evidence that proves the interview was a hoax enough doubt 
    has been created for me to decide to pull the interview. Some people have 
    contacted me with remarks and questions that raised the doubt about this interview. 
    Last month's press coverage about the identification of the author of CIH 
    also contained information that raised similar doubt. Thus the decision to 
    pull the interview. For those who missed it: you have to get a copy of VDAT 
    1.8. It is the only release that has the interview in question.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>Time or the lack of it.</b></font></p>
  <p>Lack of time is an increasing limiting factor in both collecting viruses 
    and preparing a new release of VDAT. Since this is still a hobby that does 
    not pay the bills I have go to work too. This work claims an increasing part 
    of the available daily time so sometimes the proper organization of my virus 
    collection and of VDAT has to play a secondary role. Luckily a lot of my contacts 
    in the scene specifically my fellow members of VTC help me get material I 
    might have missed.</p>
  <p>VDAT Online was aborted, mainly due to this lack of time and of proper web 
    space. It might be back, maybe even in the near future. You just have to keep 
    your eyes and ears out.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>Future</b></font></p>
  <p>This might be the last new release of VDAT for quite some time and <b><font color="#FF8040">no</font></b>, 
    I'm not quitting. In the near future I might be away from &quot;home&quot; 
    for an extended period of time, probably up to several months. I will try 
    to keep in touch with the scene enough to collect the necessary information 
    for a next release of VDAT but as I mentioned before time is scarce, especially 
    when away from home and maybe away from Internet. I will do the best I can 
    but it is possible that the next release of VDAT will not appear before January 
    2000. </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>The time has arrived. Contrary to what I stated in my last editorial this 
    will be the last <font color="#FF8040"><b>PUBLIC</b></font> release of VDAT. 
    After a little more than 4 years with 10 releases for DOS and 11 for Windows/HTML 
    I have decided to quit releasing VDAT to the general public. </p>
  <p>I will not go into a lot of detail on the &quot;Why?&quot; but I have always 
    stated I would quit when it would stop being fun. Events and incidents during 
    the last year have drastically decreased the fun I was having creating this 
    product. The virus scene is a mess and the small measure of maturity and common 
    decency that existed in it has all but evaporated. There are of course always 
    exceptions and I hope these exceptions will continue to be worthwhile. </p>
  <p>The recent explosion of the number of virus traders has certainly muddied 
    the waters of virus collecting. The number of websites offering virus trading 
    has almost quadrupled in the last couple of months and it seems that this 
    growth will continue for a while. It has not done the core goal of virus collecting 
    much good. A lot of junk is being traded and personalities, morals and values 
    have clashed. It is one of the reasons I have decided to lay low for a while, 
    I have had enough of the bickering and name calling. When I started collecting 
    viruses ratios were used just like now, but ultimately when push came to shove 
    much more was shared than now. People were often inclined to help the new 
    guy on the block, now it almost seems virus trading is like the stock market: 
    a matter of plusses and minuses.</p>
  <p>I will still update the VDAT product for my own purposes and it will remain 
    available to most of the insiders of the scene. The update cycle will no longer 
    be 3 months but it will be determined by the available spare time, it might 
    be more but also less than 3 months. The only way for the general user to 
    obtain an unrestricted copy of VDAT is to get me something from my <a href="wanted.htm">wanted 
    list</a></p>
  <p>As of January 11th 2000 my website supporting VDAT will cease to exist and 
    my e-mail account will be closed. My new e-mail address will be <a href="mailto:cicatrix@worldmail.nl?subject=VDAT%20Referred">cicatrix@worldmail.nl</a> 
    or <a href="mailto:vdat@crosswinds.net">vdat@crosswinds.net</a>. Distribution 
    of future releases will be on a case by case basis. The VDAT home page will 
    move and can be found using the <a href="http://vdat.cjb.net">http://vdat.cjb.net</a> 
    URL redirector.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">SOR (StartOfRant):</font></b></p>
  <p>I just want to say something about this millennium hype/hoax that is happening 
    as I release this edition of VDAT. The transition from 1999 to 2000 might 
    be nice &quot;round number&quot; occasion to have extra celebrations but as 
    far as I am concerned the next millennium does not start until January 1st 
    2001. Assuming there was no year 0 (zero) the year 1 was the first year of 
    the 1st century and the 1st millennium. Consequently the year 1001 was the 
    1st year of the 2nd millennium and the year 2001 will be the 1st year of the 
    3rd millennium. Also the correct term for the 2-digit versus 4-digit date 
    annotation problem in computers should be the Year 2000 bug (or Y2k) and NOT 
    the Millennium bug (or even worse Millennium virus) as some people call it. 
    So celebrate all you want but don't call the year 2000 the 21st century or 
    the next millennium, those won't start for another year. And BTW, January 
    1st 2000 is just another day of the week: I'll still get out of bed the same 
    way, I'll still have to walk the dog and my pay won't change. So what is all 
    the fuss about? </p>

  <p>For those wondering about the version number of this release: the similarity 
    with the year of release and my statement above is just coincidental :-), 
    future releases will be numbered using the Y.EAR.# format. Consequently the 
    next release will be 2.000.1 and the first release of next year will be 2.001.0 
    etc. etc. As you notice I do use 0 (zero).</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+3" color="#FF8040">Release 2.000.1</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>By using a popular patch utility this edition of VDAT is the first version 
    that is &quot;patchable&quot; from a previous version of VDAT. For now it 
    will only work when updating VDAT 2.000.0 to 2.000.1, but maybe later I will 
    release patches to older versions of VDAT. The &quot;patch&quot; will decrease 
    the download/online time necessary to get a new VDAT release and should accomodate 
    those that have been complaining about the size of VDAT. I would like to have 
    some feedback/ideas on this new feature, maybe other uses of this feature 
    are possible.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">VDAT distribution blues (continued):</font></b></p>
  <p>I have had, read and heard many reactions to my decision to limit the distribution 
    of VDAT. Some were understanding, some were angry and most were disappointed. 
    Many misunderstood the intent of my decision but since I can not explain it 
    any better than I did in the last release I am not going to explain it all 
    over again. Suffice to say that the limitation on distribution is for the 
    general &quot;Gee-see-what-I-found&quot; user only, for many not much will 
    change. Those of you that read this are welcome to this new edition of VDAT 
    and I hope you will find it useful. I have no illusions about the issued key 
    files being kept confidential, I can only ask you to keep the file to yourself, 
    there is no way I can force you.</p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">VDAT inclusion parameters:</font></b></p>
  <p>The choice of subjects and the decisions on what to include in VDAT are getting 
    more blurred every day. Not only is size a consideration but also the situation 
    that more and more activities in the VX scene are becoming mixed with non-VX 
    matters. </p>
  <p>Hacking, cracking and computer viruses are getting more and more interconnected, 
    VX groups are widening their range of interests (ASM, Cybernetic Crew, UCSI, 
    ZeroGravity etc.), hacking groups are expanding in VX related subjects (Net 
    Rage Gerrilleros, FCF, BHA, Top Device E-zine) and last but not least AV companies 
    are supporting detection of not just viruses but the wider phenomenon called 
    &quot;malware&quot;. The enormous increase in the number of &quot;backdoors&quot;, 
    &quot;trojans&quot; and other &quot;security tools&quot; has forced these 
    companies to detect these utililties. Many virus collections are cluttered 
    with these non-viruses just because they are detected by AV sofware. Contrary 
    to fully functional and viable &quot;single file&quot; viruses most samples 
    that are ID'd as a &quot;backdoors&quot; are not functional without any of 
    the accompanying files included in the originally distributed archive. The 
    detected software thus becomes &quot;cripled&quot; and is just some binary 
    code that some AV software generate &quot;hits&quot; on.</p>
  <p>Many so called &quot;pro-VX&quot; websites are muddying the waters by also 
    including &quot;backdoor&quot; and &quot;trojan&quot; material. I have the 
    impression that some webmasters don't even know the difference between these 
    files and functional viruses. There are too many mixups in terminology, even 
    in the scene itself. (A backdoor is not a virus although viruses can theoretically 
    have backdoor features, a trojan is not a virus although a virus can be distributed 
    as a trojan or can have a trojan as payload). I have no intention of including 
    any &quot;backdoor&quot;, &quot;trojan&quot; or other non-virus related material 
    in future releases of VDAT. Although for trading purposes I had to &quot;bow 
    to the majority&quot; and include these &quot;backdoor&quot; and &quot;trojan&quot; 
    hits in my virus collection, I will try to keep VDAT as &quot;clean&quot; 
    as possible.</p>
  <p>I make subjective choices on what to enter in the &quot;Engines &amp; Tools&quot; 
    section. Many viruses contain polymorphic or mutation routines. Some of these 
    routines are portable to other viruses and are called &quot;engines&quot;, 
    some routines are so embedded in a virus that they are not portable without 
    major modifications. Basically all &quot;Engines &amp; Tools&quot; that are 
    in some way named by their authors will be included in VDAT. Some &quot;engines&quot; 
    that might be portable but are not named will not be included in VDAT since 
    there is no effective way to identify or refer to these properly (eg polymorphic 
    routines or engines used in viruses such Natas, Cocaine etc.)</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#FF8040"><b>&quot;People are cranking-out poly 
    engines like maniacs, just so Cicatrix can shove yet another 3 letter acronym 
    on his Engine list&quot; / T-2000&quot;</b></font></p>
  <p>Judging from this quote I'm part of some large &quot;cause-and-effect&quot; 
    loop. I find it hard to believe VDAT is the reason people program polymorphic 
    engines or other virus related utilities. Some might spend a little extra 
    time naming their creations just so the name &quot;sounds&quot; right (e.g. 
    <a href="engine1.htm#MEDRIPOLEN">MeDriPolEn</a>) but I don't think an entry 
    in VDAT is a goal in creating/developing such routines.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">Future of VDAT:</font></b></p>
  <p>As you have noticed it has taken 4 months for a new VDAT release to appear. 
    Personally I kind of like this interval since it allows for some time to gather 
    new information (there are often extended periods of inactivity in the VX 
    scene) and people don't have to download 8+ Mb's that contain just minor updates. 
    I'm still thinking about releasing an uncompiled HTML version (easier and 
    smaller updates) but I have not made up my mind yet. Also there have been 
    (for now minor) lapses in my own motivation to continue this project (often 
    synchronous with periods of inactivity in the scene) but I think there still 
    is some kind of future for VDAT.</p>

  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">VDAT distribution blues (the never ending story):</font></b></p>
  <p>Apparently there are still some morons out there that have not gotten the 
    message. The release of VDAT to the general public is and never has been an 
    acquired constitutional right. The fact that it has been free for all to use 
    for the last years was meant as a gesture of goodwill and does not give this 
    general public the right of ownership. So to those who think my act of limiting 
    distribution is an injustice and think this move robs them of an acquired 
    right I say: <b>TOUGH!!</b> </p>
  <p>Generally reactions have been understanding and sympathetic and the majority 
    of requests for a key has been given one, even without any reciprocal donations. 
    Below you will find a short statistic on honoured and refused requests. Many 
    of you will maybe ask: &quot;If it is so easy to get one, why a key at all?&quot; 
    Well let me tell you, it will get harder in the future. I already have encountered 
    situations were a key was given with the understanding that some reciprocal 
    favour was expected in the future and were this reciprocal favour, when asked 
    for, was never honoured. These people have been placed on my personal &quot;black 
    list&quot; and will not get any future cooperation (also read: key file) from 
    me. They will join some individuals who in the past have expressed threats 
    and immature attitudes towards me personally.</p>

  <p align="center"><font color="#00FF00">issued</font> and <font color="#FF0000">refused</font></p>
  <p>I'm sure that this key I have issued or the key protection in general can 
    easily be cracked (I have seen one very easy example already), almost anything 
    can be cracked given enough know how, time and tools. Those that can crack 
    it are welcome to it, they apparently have enough knowledge to use the material 
    portrayed inside VDAT.</p>
  <p>The key is primarily meant as a limiting measure and a trading incentive 
    but there are some people out there that have nothing whatsoever to do with 
    the scene, they just like to read VDAT. Mainly for those people I have decided 
    to release the key to the current VDAT whenever a new version is about to 
    be released. That way all can read VDAT, be it sometimes with some delay.</p>
  <p>For those that genuinely like using and reading VDAT (inside and outside 
    the scene) you are welcome to it, even if some of you might not always have 
    the latest release. For those that keep on bitching and moaning, grow up and 
    leave me alone. Again, VDAT was initially meant for me and me alone, I did 
    not force it upon anyone. So even if no one wants or gets VDAT anymore I'd 
    still be putting the same effort into it. The level of maturity that radiates 
    from some of the mail I have been getting on this subject tends to confirm 
    the image that most of the outsiders have of the virus scene. Really, the 
    threats, slurs and name calling don't hurt too much, it apparently is almost 
    required reading in the virus scene of the present. You will find some positive 
    and some negative &quot;post key file&quot; quotes below:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF8040"><b>&quot;I am a follower of your VDAT "magazine" 
      and I am saddened that it will be no longer be public in it's next release.

    <p><b><font color="#FF8040">&quot;When i saw you have decided to limitate 
      the distribution of vdat, i was disappointed. I understand your reasons

    <p><b><font color="#FF8040">&quot;On the one hand I understand your decision, 
      but on the other hand many newbies will worry for all the information which 
      they can't get. &quot;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#FF8040"> &quot;...and of coz i'm fully disagree with your

      keeps up the same quality as it has had in the past until i find something 
      to send you ;-) &quot;</font></b></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8040">VDAT inclusion parameters (continued):</font></b></p>
  <p>During the recent &quot;I Love You&quot; hype I asked myself if I wanted 
    to include a reference to worms in VDAT. Especially the continuing inability 
    of the media to use the correct terminology (virus vs worm) made me think 
    about were to draw the line. Like I mentioned in my last editorial this line 
    is getting more blurred every day. </p>
  <p>Worms and viruses are different but one of the things they share made me 
    decide to include worm related material in VDAT. Contrary to Trojan Horses 
    and so called Backdoors both worms and viruses have replicatory capabilities, 
    they multiply or procreate. Therefore a <a href="specialc.htm#LL">reference 
    to the &quot;I Love You&quot; outbreak</a> was included and worm creations 
    kits were also added.</p>
