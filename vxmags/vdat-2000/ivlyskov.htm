<P><font color="#004080"><b> How did you start out in computers? </b></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've been around them for most of my life... it only seemed natural although 
    I started programming when a friend from school introduced me to QBasic in 
    '92 </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> How and when did you start out in the virus scene? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I started out in '95 collecting a few viruses from the many h/p/v sites 
    on the internet. However, I didn't really start out until three years later 
    when one day at school I came across a variant of the w97m.class virus... 
    I being the curious student took home my infected document and started to 
    dissect it. That night I had rewritten what I had learned from my experiments 
    on the class variant into a virus that would later be known as w97m.steak 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Have you written viruses? If so which would you 
  like to take credit for?</font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I've written a couple... I'll take credit where credit is due </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> How do you name your viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> The first thing that comes to mind... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Which programming languages do you know? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> QBasic, Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Visual Basic Script, 
    and pascal </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What programming language do you like using the 
  most? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> vba... it's easy and it's effective ;) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Are you a member of a VX group? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="groups2.htm#SKAM">SWL</a> (Skamwerks Labs) and <a href="groups1.htm#DUVC">DVC</a> 
    (Dutch Virii Community) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Which AV software do you like/respect the most? 
  Which the least? </font></b></P>
<blockquote> 
  <p> hmm... I don't know about 'respect' although I use f-prot and avp the most 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What are your goals (VX wise)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> To code a virus that will someday be my bestfriend... he will be able to 
    do my homework... walk the dog... and even beat up the neighborhood bully 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your view on the continuous 'war' between 
  VX and AV. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> War?... I thought it was more or less a game... Although who keeps who in 
    business? </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Where did you get you handle? What does it mean? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> It was the only one not taken... it was sitting in a dark dusty corner all 
    by itself... and it was on sale!!! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your view on Virus Creation software (eg. 
  VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I try to stay out of politics... although, someone took the time to code 
    it... why not exploit it?! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly 
  or HLL viruses? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I think it's the coders ability to work with the language that he or she 
    uses... quality is the most important aspect of any project </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Maybe... maybe not... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which the least? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> They're all good in their own way </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  in the VX world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I respect a few, just ask me and I'll tell you if I respect you or not... 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> In the AV world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I try to ignore them like they try to ignore me... except I'm more of a 
    pain to them than they are to me </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Which individual or what group do you like/respect 
  outside the VX or the AV world? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> That would have to be both my family and friends </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I know I have written a few with destructive payloads... however I've come 
    to wonder "what's the point?" Destructive payloads take very little creativity... 
    If you want to piss somebody off just display a naked picture of their mother! 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Are biological viruses considered 'good?' </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What do you do in 'real' life? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I sit on my ass in a realy uncomfortable chair... I'm a future professional 
    bum! </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Do people outside the VX scene know what you do 
  (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> My friends know... they think it's 'cool' I'm sure the fbi knows too... 
    although I doubt they think it's 'cool' ;) </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking, 
  phreaking, warez etc.)? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I do a little computer grafics and I enjoy reading old hack/phreak tutorials 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference 
  between creation and spreading? </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> No they shouldn't... though if it cuases damage the author should be held 
    reliable. Of course there is a difference. </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> Describe the perfect virus. </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> The one that knows me on a first name basis... </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your view on Windows (95/98) </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like it... though I wouldn't endorse it </p>
</blockquote>
<P> <b><font color="#004080"> What is your advice for people just starting out? 
  </font></b></P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Source code and a lot of patience... don't give up ('Script Kiddies' are 
    lame!) </p>
</blockquote>
