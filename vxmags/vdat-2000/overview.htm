<P>The word &quot;virus&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;trouble.&quot;
Computer won't boot? &quot;Maybe it's a virus!&quot; Usually, troubles
with a computer are not caused by viruses, but rather by hardware that
is failing, changes in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT, or user errors. </P>

<P>Viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and logic bombs are all unwanted, uninvited,
potentially dangerous software, but there are important distinctions among
them. The differences lie in whether the category requires a host program
and whether it makes copies of itself. All four may cause damage, but this
is not integral to the definitions. The table defines each one. </P>

<TD width="300" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Replicates?</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="121" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Virus</TD>

<TD width="302" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Yes. Viruses require a host, by definition.
By inserting themselves in existing executable programs, they are harder
to detect, and ensure that they will be run from time to time. </TD>

<TD width="300" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Yes. All viruses make copies of themselves,
infecting other boot sectors, master boot records, or programs as the opportunity
arises. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="121" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Worm</TD>

<TD width="302" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">No. A host is not required, because worms
are typically a mainframe problem, and do not need to hide from most users.
</TD>

<TD width="300" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Yes. A worm makes copies of itself as
it finds the opportunity. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="121" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Trojan Horse</TD>

<TD width="302" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">No. While the term &quot;Trojan horse&quot;
sometimes refers to the program containing destructive code, the term is
more often used to refer to the entire COM or EXE. </TD>

<TD width="300" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">No. Most Trojan horses activate when
they are run, and often destroy the structure of the current drive (FATs,
directory), obliterating themselves in the process. </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD width="121" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Bug, Logic Bomb, Time Bomb</TD>

<TD width="302" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Yes. Programmers cannot write a bug without
also writing other code -- although it's fair to say that most programmers
do not intentionally write bugs; logic bombs and time bombs are inserted
by programmers in otherwise &quot;good&quot; code. </TD>

<TD width="300" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">No. This code generally has better things
to do than making copies of itself. Logic bombs and time bombs wish to
remain hidden, with only their effects visible. Bugs do just about everything
except make more bugs. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>Viruses are programs that require a host and replicate. Viruses are
fairly rare but when infections occur, the viruses came from home computers
(as a result of contact with high risk areas such as schools), service
technicians, sales representatives, new computers, repaired computers,
commercial shrink - wrapped software that has never been opened, and software
that has been infected, returned to the dealer, re - packaged, and re - sold.
Most of the viruses we know about today were written in the former USSR,
Bulgaria, Germany, and the US, and were probably written by teenagers and
college students. </P>

<P>The best prevention is a combination of changing your computing behavior
and using an anti - virus product wisely: </P>

<UL>
<LI>scan all new software </LI>

<LI>scan all new data diskettes </LI>

<LI>be on the lookout for suspicious activity </LI>

<LI>disable drive A: </LI>

<LI>shop for an anti - virus product that suits your needs. </LI>

<LI>when removing a virus, don't let your anti - virus product do everything
it claims it can -- at least not right away. </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="HowManyVirusesAreThere"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>How Many Viruses
Are There?</FONT></B></P>

<P>How many viruses are there? I asked this question on December 31, 1994.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>One method of assessing how many viruses there are in the world is
to assume the perfection of one or more scanners, and ask the vendor how
many viruses the scanner detects. Of products reviewed, one scanner vendor
claimed to detect 5,563 different viruses as of December 31, 1994. </LI>

<LI>An inference of the extent to which FRISK Software's F-Prot undercounts
boot viruses would estimate that there are 7,130 viruses in the world at
the end of 1994.. </LI>

<LI>An inference based on a range of scanner underestimations in general
suggests that there may have been 8,344 different viruses in the world
at the end of 1994. </LI>

<LI>V-Base reported 5,797 viruses as of October, 1994. Assuming that V-Base
described every single virus written up to October 1, then based on growth
rates for the period 1986 through October 1994, we could infer 7,847 viruses
at the end of 1994. </LI>

<LI>V-Base undercounts newer viruses. Based on growth rates for the period
1987-1992, we can estimate 7,108 viruses at the end of 1994. </LI>
</UL>

<P>For those who believe in averages, the average of these estimation methods
is 7,198 viruses as of December 31, 1994. </P>

<P>Viruses come from all over the globe, but a few countries produce far
more than their share: Germany, Bulgaria, the former USSR, and the U.S.
The total number of viruses authored is shown in the table below. One day,
we'll have a better understanding of the number of computers in each country,
and will be able to look at authorship rates per 1,000 computers. Our impression
is that such rates are highest in eastern and southern Europe and the former
USSR. </P>

<P>To make our lives miserable, a virus can infect files and boot sectors,
since boot sectors are executable programs. Many more viruses are designed
to infect files than to infect boot or master boot sectors, and that some
boot viruses won't infect hard disks. </P>

<P>While boot viruses are our most common office infections, there just
aren't as many species of them as there are species of file viruses. Among
the boot viruses, some such as Brain will infect the hard disk, but most
do. </P>

<P>Of all viruses, over 80% infect COM files, but only 40% infect EXE files.
The structure of a COM file is much easier for a virus author to deal with,
and many authors write their first virus to infect COM files only. Viruses
are easier to identify when they have infected COM files, for most add
a constant number of bytes to a COM file, a variable number of bytes to
an EXE file. By determining how many bytes have been added to a COM file,
you can use V-Base to look up the virus. </P>

<P><A NAME="WhyDoPeopleWriteViruses"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Why Do People
Write Viruses?</FONT></B></P>

<P>Most folks think that the virus problem is something of a battle between
themselves, as defenders of their computers, and viruses, as attackers.
Sometimes I meet someone who realizes that the warfare is not with viruses,
but with virus authors. Once someone asked me why a virus author would
want to harm a system they had never even seen, to injure someone they
had never met. </P>

<P>That is a good question. </P>

<P>The answer may be this: the warfare does not target the user. The warfare
is between viruses and anti-virus products, between virus authors and anti-virus
product developers. Just as in Missile Command games, the victims are those
who live in the cities below, where the shrapnel lands. </P>

<P>There are many reasons why I know this battle is between vendors and
virus authors. First, I think that many virus authors see it this way.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>For many years, I have seen viruses that targeted specific anti-virus
products. For instance, the virus author known as Dark Avenger has written
a number of viruses that seek programs containing the copyright notice
of Vesselin Bontchev, and destroy or disable them when found. Such programs
are anti-virus products, which are intended to destroy the work of Dark
Avenger. Similarly, the new Peach virus targets the checksum files produced
by Central Point Anti-Virus. </LI>

<LI>A number of virus authors seem more interested in getting the attention
of anti-virus product developers than in actually spreading their virus
&quot;in the field.&quot; A number of viruses seem to find their way directly
to our hands and those of other researchers, without ever being seen in
the field </LI>

<LI>Many viruses contain far more code to make them difficult to analyze
than they contain code that makes them hard to detect. For instance, the
Whale virus is encrypted 64 layers deep. It took anti-virus product developers
and researchers several man-weeks each to take this thing apart, only to
find very little of interest inside this contraption. Similarly, while
Dark Avenger's viruses are typically somewhat difficult to detect, many
are disassembly-resistant, producing useless disassemblies of hundreds
pages for source code that is only a few K in size. And the Dark Avenger's
self-mutating engine is a tool that makes viruses which incorporate it
more difficult for and-virus products to detect, not more lethal or effective
in spreading on your computer. </LI>

<LI>Some viruses are designed to spread using your anti-virus product as
an agent, hardly a trait that will make you love your anti-virus product
more. Viruses such as Frodo will infect when DOS opens a file; any scanner
or checksum program which opens a file when such viruses are in memory
will provide the virus with an opportunity to infect it. Your anti-virus
product will play right into the hands of such a virus, if it is unable
to detect it in memory and act appropriately. </LI>
</UL>

<P>It is not merely the virus author who sees this as an international
game of Missile Command, targeting the anti-virus products. The developers
of the product also seem to feel this way, targeting the most interesting
viruses, and sometimes ignoring the shrapnel that lands on the cities below.
Consider this: </P>

<UL>
<LI>When Whale was first discovered and shared by the virus research community,
everyone seemed to stop work in progress to deal with it. All products
somehow need to detect Whale, even though there have been no reports of
it in the US (to our knowledge), and only scattered reports elsewhere.
Now that Pogue is making the rounds in the research community, the same
thing seems to be happening. There is much hubbub about polymorphic viruses,
which will be much ado about nothing for the next year or so. </LI>

<LI>Anti-virus products seem to focus on scanning, a fun technology to
develop if you are a marketing department, because you get to report body
counts. No product seems to have shown any interest in virus removal -
some can't do it at all, and the rest generally do it quite poorly. All
products detect far more viruses than they remove, a commentary on the
vendor's focus on the incoming missiles, rather than the shrapnel landing
on the cities. </LI>
</UL>

<P>If the war is now between the virus authors and the anti-virus product
developers, and the battleground is in your computer, then we certainly
have an interest in the outcome of the battle. The results now seem to
be clear: the virus authors have won, and continue to win, the battles.
The virus authors will win the war. Here's why I think this: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The US won the Revolution and lost in Vietnam for many reasons, but
military historians know that volunteers often fight harder than paid mercenaries.
A virus author is quite willing to stay up all night; some programmers
working on anti-virus products go home at 5 PM. </LI>

<LI>Military historians know there is strength in union. The virus authors
are working together, the anti-virus product developers are working in
isolation. The virus authors have several commercially-published books
available on how to write viruses. They have a number of BBSs around the
world through which they share source code, viruses, and information. The
anti-virus product developers get together from time to time, but all their
programmers have signed such restrictive non-disclosure agreements that
there is little exchange of technology. </LI>

<LI>Military historians also know that the size of the army affects the
outcome. At the moment, there may be 300-400 virus authors at work on their
projects around the world. The thousands of viruses they have created are
battling a few dozen products. In your computer, any one of these viruses
may be doing battle with one product or less. That one product is the work
of just one to 6 programmers, on average. Very few anti-virus products
are the work of more than a half dozen programmers. Because anti-virus
developers work in isolation, the armies number perhaps 50 to 100 bad guys
for every good guy. </LI>

<LI>One military historian is reported to have observed that the secret
to success is to &quot;get there fustest with the mostest&quot; Surely
these two armies are distributed differently. Viruses are free; products
must be paid for. Viruses are self-installing; products must be installed.
Viruses run automatically; products must be deliberately run by the user.
The virus is likely to get there first. </LI>

<LI>The talent embodied in our viruses is certainly beyond that embodied
in our average user. Virus authors understand the intricacies of assembly
language, the CPU, the operating system, disk and file structure, the boot
process. Few users can claim to have mastered a single application program.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>It would be nice to say something upbeat here, but that's the way it
looks: the virus authors have won the war. It's up to you to win as many
of the battles as you can. </P>

<P><A NAME="HowDoVirusesSpread"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>How Do Viruses Spread?</FONT></B></P>

<P>No one really knows how many viruses are out there because virus infections
are under-reported. One of the reasons for under-reporting is the stigma
attached to being infected with a virus -- &quot;this happened because
I've done something bad&quot;. And so most infections are not reported
to anyone. In one major survey of North American corporations, we learned
that by far the most common source of office infections is via diskette
brought in to work from a home computer. But viruses can spread using all
of the channels, both formal and informal, through which software is distributed.
You can get them from service technicians, sales representatives, new computers,
repaired computers, commercial shrink-wrapped software that has never been
opened, and software that has been infected, returned to the dealer, re-packaged,
and re-sold. The most common sources of virus infections, as reported in
a Dataquest study done in late 1991, are shown below. </P>

<P>I don't propose that you stop taking work home. If you have a home PC,
it is probably not at risk of infection from software brought home from
work, but rather from disks that your son or daughter may bring home from
school, have shared with their friends, etc. Use your home PC to do work
for your company, if that is consistent with corporate policy. But scan
your machine before using it, if you share the computer with other family
members who might not be so thoughtful. </P>

<P>Because of the variety of ways that a virus can get into your machine,
it is important for you to begin feeling a bit concerned about every new
diskette you put in your machine. In our office, our policy is to never
boot with an unknown floppy, and never run a program from an untrusted
source without first checking it for viruses. </P>

<P><A NAME="PiracyandComputerViruses"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Piracy and Computer
Viruses</FONT></B></P>

<P>Software piracy has never provoked the kind of emotion that child abduction
or grand theft auto has. After all, when a child or car is taken, no copy
of it is left behind. The owner is deprived. </P>

<P>Piracy is different. When I give you a copy of my favorite program,
I seem to do you a favor. You appreciate the favor, and reciprocate in
some way. We both come out ahead There do not seem to be any victims. But
there are. </P>

<P>Piracy refers to some violation of copyright law or license agreement,
in which a copy that might have been sold by a vendor is, instead, given
freely by another patty, depriving the vendor of some revenue. </P>

<P>Since many users are not particularly fond of vendors, such deprivation
does not seem to be one of life's greatest tragedies. Vendors get what
they deserve, say some users. Their software is overpriced. Their support
is lacking. I wouldn't have bought it anyway. I don't use it very often.
If I really get to using it a lot, I'D buy my own copy. We've heard it
many times. We've thought it. We've said it. </P>

<P>I will not argue here that piracy is impoverishing American vendors.
It is not piracy but the economy that is killing software vendors in this
country today. And even if piracy were hurting vendors deeply, most users
wouldn't care. Such loss does not seem to have any personal consequence
for users. </P>

<P>I will not argue that if your firm is using pirated software, tomorrow's
mail might contain a letter from the Software Publishers Association. Not
to be confused with the Publishers Clearinghouse, this group won't be sending
you any million dollar checks. Instead you might learn that you are about
to lose tens of thousands of dollars in penalties they will levy (and your
boss and stockholders will pay) in an out-of-court settlement. Sure, this
is a good threat, but SPA is still in business because pirates never think
that what they are doing is very wrong. A little wrong, maybe. But not
very wrong. </P>

<P>What I will argue is that piracy causes problems that dc affect you.
That there are, indeed, some good reasons why you should Pay for what you
use. </P>

<P>I have two arguments against piracy, and I'll tell you both. Then you
can decide if there is enough reason to start paying for software. </P>

<P>My first argument deals with the virus problem, a problem that has an
immediate impact on you. The problem is that viruses travel through the
same channels that other kinds of software travel. Pirated software, being
software that has been passed from one machine to another, is software
that has had a great opportunity to acquire a virus or two. The more machines
a program has been in, the greater its chance of being infected. The more
desirable a program, the more machines it has a chance of being in. This
is why we warn our users to be careful of game software. Because it is
fun, it is likely to be pirated. Because it is pirated, it is likely to
be infected. But our warning should not be about games. It should be about
piracy or viruses or both. </P>

<P>Piracy is not a problem when people do not respect the notion of intellectual
property. In the old Soviet Union, there was little personal ownership
of anything, including an idea Without such a concept of property ownership,
we could hardly expect much clamor about piracy or trademark infringement.
The Soviet Union, as a consequence, has one of the highest infection rates
in the world. Soviets are joined by all of Asia and by Eastern Europe,
which also lack much in the way of property, intellectual property, or
laws to protect intellectual property. </P>

<P>In China, for instance, the only legislation that protects software
is just one year old. Developed in apparent response to US pressure, it
protects only new software, and only if registered in 30 days. Registration
is not necessarily a good idea. According to the Wall Street Journal (June
17, 1991, p. 7) China's bureaucracy &quot;employs a strategy of poaching
technology from overseas. Whether the product is farm chemicals, machine
tools, medicines, or software, China's central government ministries all
have departments designated to obtain foreign technology at no cost to
China.&quot; With a whole infrastructure within the ministries set up to
copy things, registering your software with the government of China sounds
like a great opportunity for them to acquire your technology without leaving
the office. Legislation alone cannot change a public morality or protect
our software industry. Consumers and users must revise their thinking and
behavior. What are the consequences of this pervasive piracy? Our chance
of getting an infection in a computer in the US is perhaps one infection
per 400 computers per year in 1992. In Asia, it is more like one infection
per computer per week. </P>

<P>The worldwide variation in infection rates corresponds surprisingly
well with the worldwide variation in piracy. But there are local variations
that are also of interest. Consider our hotbeds of computer viruses: high
schools and colleges. It is in these settings where piracy is also at its
highest. </P>

<P>Or consider who in your office experienced the most recent infection.
I wasn't there, I don't know. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone
who didn't think it was very wrong to borrow software, to try it a little
bit before paying for it, who was always curious about how new software
works. </P>

<P>I told you I had two arguments against software piracy. My second argument
concerns what piracy does to the software industry long-term On this point,
let me tell you three stories. </P>

<P>Story #1: I once ran a company named Starware. Back in 1982-1983, we
were one of Washington DC's first places (other than the IBM Product Centers)
where you could buy an IBM PC. We were there before Computerland. There
wasn't much graphics software available for the PC, so we wrote The Draftsman,
a graphics program that could do pie, bar, line and scatterplot charts,
text charts, mix them together on the page, add illustrations, and put
them all together in a slideshow. The F1 key pulled up context-sensitive
help, and you could print or plot your work We grossed $50,000 the first
month we sold it. At $200 a pop, it was priced fairly, and did just fine
until our little business folded. I turned our treasure into shareware,
inviting those who found it valuable to send a check for $25. In the last
10 years, as a shareware author, I've made nearly $200 - the price of one
copy when we sold it commercially. </P>

<P>I don't know how other shareware authors do, but I know that many don't
pay the rent with their work and most never release a second product I
think that the shareware industry has been badly crippled by user attitudes.
Users think that shareware is free. They don't have the foggiest idea of
why a shareware author would write the programs. I've had faxes from Australia,
asking if I have any new versions that work with the Blimpo 2000 color-fax-pancake
maker. I've had calls at midnight asking for hard copies of the manuals.
I've had everything but checks. These inquiries prove that people are copying
its using it, and not paying for it. </P>

<P>Story #2: Starware released MathDrills, a program to teach the multiplication
tables. It also taught division, addition, and subtraction. It did it with
the only technique that works: endless drill, ample reward It kept score.
It made little tunes. It was fun. My son learned the times tables with
it one weekend I sold hundreds of individual copies through the IBM Product
Centers. I gave hundreds of &quot;evaluation copies&quot; to school districts.
I never received an order from one school. How could it sell so well in
the stores, yet so badly by mail to school systems? You might quip that
the name was the best part, and anyone who had a chance to try it would
have enough sense not to buy it. I'm not so sure. My son liked it. </P>

<P>In my old age, I've come to think that the biggest pirates in our land
share two things in common: high need, low budget. They are teenagers and
teachers. Neither seems disposed to pay for software. And as a result,
there is effectively no educational software industry in the world </P>

<P>Story #3: I was in Kuala Lumpur, standing in a computer store, admiring
the empty shelves. You don't need shelving in Asian computer stores, because
there is nothing you can put on them that you can sell. Software in Asia
sells one or two copies the week it comes out and any other copies gather
dust. Do I exaggerate? Not according to everyone I talked to. In the world
of viruses in Asia, one of the best selling products is PC&lt;illin. It
is so thoroughly copy protected that it requires a dongle(and is made by
a firm that began in the dongle business.) But better selling than PC-Cillin
is a product merely named &quot;PC-Cillin Compatible.&quot; This fine product
bears a marvelous resemblance to PC-Cillin, except that it requires a cheap
card, rather than a dongle, and sells for half the price. Piracy? Grand
Larceny! </P>

<P>It isn't just software that takes a bruising in Asia. Firmware (software
in hardware) can be reverse engineered and brought to market over the weekend.
I know. A friend in Thailand is in that line of work And what has been
the net effect of this? There is nearly no software industry in Asia There
is nearly no software industry in the Soviet Union. There is nearly no
software industry in the Eastern Block countries. Everywhere in the world
where piracy flourishes, software industries wither and die. </P>

<P>America needs a software industry. So does any country with dreams of
a growing economy and world leadership. Or any country that dreams that
one day, computers will make lives more productive and more pleasant. </P>

<P>Maybe the SPA will come get the pirates. Maybe it will be the viruses.
Maybe it will be the collapse of the software industry whose products they
so enjoy. My wife has a phrase for all this. She says &quot;what goes around
comes around&quot; Maybe it will. </P>

<P><A NAME="IsitaProblem"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Is it a Problem?</FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="ArentVirusesRare"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Aren't Viruses Rare?</FONT></B></P>

<P>Viruses were once a very minor security problem. Your probability of
infection was too low to justify the devotion of too many resources to
the ;problem. But today the probability of infection has risen to an astonishing
level. Given the certainty that your organization will experience an infection
in the next six months, and given the likelihood that systems lacking virus&shy;free
backups will lose important programs and perhaps data files, some intelligent
action for prevention and detection is now required. </P>

<P>While the best defense against viruses is prevention, the cost of complete
;prevention is probably excessive. Consequently, your best use of your
;anti&shy;virus budget would be to save some funds for recovery. </P>

<P>Your exact probability of being infected is a function of several factors:
the number of viruses appearing at your door, and the measures you have
in place for preventing their entry through that door. The number &quot;at
the door&quot; is determined by the frequency with which new software is
brought into your organization (by disk or modem) and the increasing probability
that this software is virus&shy;infected. The measures in place are established
by policy and procedure. </P>

<P>The magnitude of the threat is difficult to estimate, given the extent
of under&shy;reporting. Victims of crimes, like the rest of us, wish to
believe in a &quot;just world&quot;, in which good things happen to good
people, bad things happen to bad people. Because a virus infection is definitely
a bad thing, victims often feel some shame and guilt. No one feels pride
when they experience an infection, no one seems to want to talk about it.
But it is increasingly clear that computer viruses are posing a new, grave
threat to safe computing. You can do something to help make computing safe
again. We're all counting on you. </P>

<P>We'll try to answer the &quot;commonness&quot; question with two sets
of numbers. The first is the result of surveying 16 U.S. corporate computer
security experts. Combined, they had information about viruses for over
60,000 PCs. We asked them how many of those PCs were infected with a virus
in the last 12 months. The table shows their answers. Just over one in
ten office computers in North America seems to have been infected in 1992.

<P>Does this percentage match your own experience? If users are not punished
for reporting an infection, and if they know who to call when they find
an infection, then your own statistics on infection may be fairly accurate.
If they are higher than 11% for 1992, then you might consider your organization
basically &quot;high risk&quot;. If they are lower, then you are among
the &quot;low risk&quot; organizations. Of course, .00001% might still
be considered too high. </P>

<P>The second answer comes from the 1,811 viruses analyzed for prevalence
in the May 1993 version of V-Base. Of these viruses, you are unlikely to
come across 96% of them. </P>

<P><A NAME="ArentthereanyGoodViruses"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Aren't there
any &quot;Good&quot; Viruses?</FONT></B></P>

<P>Definers disagree, but most would say that a computer virus is a computer
program that makes copies of itself by inserting itself into other programs.
</P>

<P>By its design, if not its definition, the virus modifies your software
without your knowledge or approval. Often, but not always, the virus damages
some aspect of your system or interferes with your work. Often, but not
always, the virus causes unintended damage due to bug in it or incompatibilities
with your system. </P>

<P>Is the virus a bad thing? Some argue that there can be such a thing
as a &quot;good virus.&quot; I think they are wrong. Here's why. </P>

<P>Many argue that there is nothing illegal about writing, selling, or
distributing viruses. They may be incorrect. Consider our license agreements
for our software. Most indicate that you may not make alterations to the
software you have purchased; most require that if alterations are made,
your license is no longer in effect, and you must destroy all copies you
have. The virus violates this agreement. </P>

<P>We also have the Computer Security Act of 1987, which makes it a crime
to damage the information in government computers. The virus is likely
to do just this. No virus contains safeguards to prevent itself from entering
government systems, and consequently the government has been the victim
of thousands of infections. We must conclude that virus authors knowingly
write code that will ultimately enter and damage government systems. </P>

<P>And we have a Bill of Rights which gives you the right of self-determination.
The virus takes this right away, and determines things for you. </P>

<P>As computer users, we value the control we have over our computers.
Computer users enjoy their computers when they are predictable, when a
known action at the keyboard produces a predictable reaction on the screen
and drives, and when the only events in the machine are those of our own
doing. The virus takes our control away, takes that control for itself.
With a virus, our computer can no longer be trusted to do what we expect.
</P>

<P>From an economic standpoint, viruses must be opposed. Every day, an
increasing fraction of our GNP comes from the work done by computers, as
we move to an information society. The virus stands as an enemy of the
economy, threatening to take us back to the Stone Age of pads and pens.
The effects on the GNP include direct effects, when the virus damages our
information, and indirect effects, when the virus problem means that we
must buy anti-virus products, read and learn about viruses, and take anti-virus
precautions. The cost of 50 million PC users spending one minute each day
scanning for viruses comes to $200 million per year, if the average user
earns just $10 per hour. If scanning time averages five minutes per day,
and wages average $20 per hour, then the virus bill comes to $2 billion
per year. Add to this the cost of 50 million anti-virus products which
we hope these 50 million users will rush out and purchase (so the virus
is stopped at their machine, before it gets to ours) at an average cost
of perhaps $30 each with site licenses: $1.5 billion. Shall I calculate
the cost of installing 50 million products? Reading 50 million manuals?
And remember that this cost is per year, for last year's scanner won't
give you much protection this year! </P>

<P>Many of the costs are difficult to calculate in dollars. But even if
we didn't have these social costs to reckon with, consider the problem
of removing a virus. If a virus gets into your network, and it must be
brought down for a few days while you check every single diskette in the
building, what is that cost? Some businesses could think about going under
if they couldn't function for a few days. Others will merely sink farther
into debt </P>

<P>While these costs are starting to look like the national bill for health
care, we must remember that the computer health care bill is avoidable.
Computer viruses are not &quot;natural&quot; problems. They are not evolving
life forms. They are deliberately written by programmers. </P>

<P>Software developers must be enraged by the virus problem. No longer
can users trust software downloaded from bulletin boards or purchased in
shrink wrap or delivered by sales representatives. Viruses are coming from
everywhere, and no distribution channel is safe any longer. </P>

<P>Even if no virus ever did any intentional damage, it is hard to imagine
a virus that never did unintended damage. Much of the damage caused by
common viruses appears to be the result of incompatibility between virus
and machine. Early authors, for instance, could not foresee the advent
of disk drives with capacities over 360K. Virus authors are not God. They
do not know what computers we will own tomorrow, and cannot write for those
computers. What they write today is likely to damage us tomorrow. </P>

<P>How can we permit anyone to stand on a soapbox and advocate our destruction?
How can we grant them space in the pages of our publications to announce
a reward for &quot;clever&quot; viruses? To argue the case that a virus
can be good? It is time we all said &quot;enough.&quot; If your reading
of the law is not like mine, and you think that writing viruses is legal,
then let's change the law. Nothing this destructive should be legal. </P>

<P>Several years ago, I was asked by a television interviewer what I would
do if I found a confirmed virus author sitting on the sofa next to me.
I replied that I would &quot;probably break his face.&quot; That was the
sound bite that made the evening news. I don't regret my policy on such
faces. I hope you will adopt my policy as your own. </P>

<P><A NAME="TheDollarCostsofViruses"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Dollar Costs
of Viruses</FONT></B></P>

<P>To make your case for purchasing anti-virus software and implementing
a virus prevention program, you must justify the costs. The costs of a
virus are influenced by factors such as the strain involved (some cause
more damage than others), the delay in detection (longer delays mean more
widespread infection), the involvement of a network (in a networked office
where the server is unprotected, a virus may spread to all logged in nodes
in a few minutes), your experience in removing viruses (your first experience
will be the most expensive), and other factors. Many infections will cost
under $2,000 in labor costs in eradicating the virus, though sometimes
costs exceed $100,000. One Federal agency reported that a virus cost them
$25,000 per hour, for a total of one week. That works out to a million
dollars! </P>

<P>The table below shows the dollar costs of virus infections, from a study
by Dataquest in late 1991 -- one third of virus infections cost up to $2000;
some cost over $100,000. </P>

<P><A NAME="DoesYourComputerHaveAIDS"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Does Your Computer
Have AIDS?</FONT></B></P>

<P>&quot;Your computer has AIDS&quot; is the message displayed by the AIDS
computer virus. Not very funny. The epidemic that is beginning to sweep
our computers is less devastating, and less consequential, than the biological
epidemics that have swept this planet. Unfortunately, this does not weaken
the metaphor. The lessons of biological epidemiology should serve us in
the field of artificial, unwanted life: computer virus epidemiology. </P>

<P>One stark lesson may come from our rediscovery of the Pollyanna Principle.
Once, as a psychologist, I wrote a book of that title. Its premise, as
I recall was that humans have a special skill in seeing the silver lining
of every cloud, of putting on a happy face, of finding some good in every
tragedy that afflicts them. Even Job didn't pack it in. </P>

<P>The problem with Pollyanna was that she made a rotten forecaster. She
wouldn't have wanted to believe in global warming, holes in the ozone layer,
the end of the Spotted Owl . And she wouldn' t have wanted to believe in
viruses. When she was forced to face the facts, she would have wanted to
believe that this was just another problem for computer science to tackle,
and everything would work out. </P>

<P>We are all Pollyannas. Consider how we've been Pollyannas about the
(biological) AIDS epidemic. An AP wirestory recently reported that a &quot;grim
new vision of the world AIDS epidemic predicts that more than 25 million
people will have the disease by the end of the decade, and up to 120 million
will be infected&quot; Consider these points that come from a study, released
by Harvard University researchers as an 800 page book, &quot;AIDS in the
World 1992&quot;: </P>

<P>Recognition of the problem comes too late. When the AIDS epidemic was
first recognized in 1981, an estimated 100,000 people around the world
were already infected. If we continue to delay in recognizing the computer
virus problem, hundreds of gigabytes of information will be lost, and hundreds
of thousands of computers will be infected. Late recognition of a problem
means less time available to consider and implement solutions. </P>

<P>Early pessimism proves optimistic. The new study predicts that infections
will be far greater than the recent projections of the World Health Organization,
which predicted that the problem will be far greater than previous predictions.
</P>

<P>This sounds like our projections for global warming, for the ozone hole,
for the virus problem. Why can't we face unpleasant predictions earlier?
In 1991, the virus problem was worse than anyone had imagined it would
be in 1990. Today the problem has gotten worse than anyone imagined it
would be in any prior year. Let's get serious about projections, and stop
fooling around with wishful thinking. </P>

<P>Problems are unstable. According to the report, HIV and AIDS are not
increasing at a steady rate. They are growing geometrically. In 1981, there
were an estimated 100,000 cases of HIV worldwide. In 1992, the number had
reached 2.6 million. For this 11 year period, the number doubled 4.5 times,
a doubling rate of every 29 months. But the study forecasts that the number
of HIV cases in the year 2000 will be between 48 million and 120 million.
Assuming that the result is somewhere in between 48 and 120 million, for
this eight year period, the problem will double about 8 times, a doubling
rate of every 19 months. The doubling rate is not constant, but growing
worse. </P>

<P>For a time, IBM researchers suggested that the rate at which the virus
incidents were increasing could best be described as a straight line. Those
who understand Catastrophe Theory know that straight lines approximate
very little in the world, especially things biological. IBM does understand
geometric progression when it comes to the number of computer viruses,
concluding that the number of different viruses is doubling about every
8.5 months. </P>

<P>Local problems become global problems. In 1981, when HIV was first discovered
by the Western world, 100,000 in the Third World were already afflicted.
The study predicts that by the turn of the century, 42% of AIDS infections
will be in Asia, 31% in sub-Saharan Africa </P>

<P>The computer virus epidemic is also not uniformly distributed. Asia,
the old Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe all seem to have more than their
fair share of viruses. But what you don't know can hurt you. Without attention,
HIV has become a global menace. So has the computer virus problem. </P>

<P>Global problems require global solutions. The report contends that a
new global strategy is needed to stop the AIDS epidemic, or at least slow
it down. </P>

<P>The same might be said of the computer virus problem, which knows no
political boundaries. </P>

<P><A NAME="VirusestheLawandMorality"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Viruses, the
Law, and Morality</FONT></B></P>

<P>What is the effect of talking about the virus problem? Opinions differ.
One view is that only with a full discussion of the problem can those who
should respond be prepared for a proper response. Others feel that a public
discussion serves to attract attention to the problem, and to generate
more interest in it on the part of more trouble makers. </P>

<P>We have heard these arguments in various forms. </P>

<UL>
<LI>NSA, NCSC, the FBI, Secret Service, CIA, and other organizations with
an interest in computer security do not like to talk about what they know,
on the grounds that it would expose known security holes, leaving systems
vulnerable. Security experts, on the other hand, protest that they are
unable to benefit from the wisdom of these agencies in making their systems
more secure if these agencies do not provide them with some assistance.
</LI>

<LI>Many vendors encrypt the scan strings in their anti-virus products,
so that virus authors have more trouble modifying existing viruses so that
the scanner does not detect them. But users then complain that their scanner
won't accept encrypted or unencrypted scan strings from other sources.
</LI>

<LI>Security BBSs sometimes come under fire when they distribute information
normally available only through the underground. Should the COMSEC BBS
in San Francisco, for instance, carry &quot;40HEX&quot;, an underground
publication including virus disassemblies? Some argue that it should, for
the information may be of value to security practitioners, and knowledge
of the existence of such information may also be valuable. Some argue no,
that security experts have no need to see a virus disassembly, nor does
anyone else. </LI>

<LI>We have heard stories of folks who felt that the best way to deal with
the virus problem was to help folks develop first-hand experience with
viruses, and so made viruses available to any who seemed &quot;qualified&quot;
and interested. Some of these folks have been anti-virus vendors, whose
qualification process meant establishing that the recipient was a potential
purchaser, and distributed the viruses at no charge. Others established
that the recipient was apparently interested in performing some virus research,
thus qualifying the recipient for &quot;researcher&quot; status, and distributing
the viruses for a small &quot;handling fee.&quot; We indeed live in a world
of gray that color monitors have done nothing to sharpen. What is the difference
between giving a virus to someone and charging a handling fee? What is
the difference between giving a virus to a stranger and giving a virus
to a friend, who will in turn give it to a stranger? </LI>
</UL>

<P>In this office, I try to see in terms of black and white, rather than
gray. We'd like to say that no one should give a virus to anyone for any
reason. But I'd also like to say that good guy virus researchers should
have access to viruses. The problem is that good guys don't wear white
hats. Among virus researchers are a large number of seemingly gray individuals-those
who have clearly done both good and evil, those who seem to be good yet
don't beget our trust, those who have earned our trust and then seem to
betray us. </P>

<P>This grayness is clear to users. One week, I asked my class if anyone
in the room trusted anti-virus vendors. Not one would raise their hand.
I asked if anyone believed the back of the anti-virus product box. None
did. Instead, I am asked by classes every week if vendors write viruses.
</P>

<P>I must say that this is an improvement over two years ago, when classes
believed that viruses were somewhat mythical beings invented by vendors
to scare users into buying products. Many of the public saw through the
vendor-inspired hysteria of Michelangelo last March. Garrick Utley asked
me on CBS Evening News if I thought this Michelangelo thing was the result
of profiteering. I replied that I believed that while there had been much
profit-taking, vendors had generally been well-behaved and tried to present
the truth. </P>

<P>There were so many exceptions to this claim, however, that I think I
may have lied to TV viewers. With the biggest anti-virus vendors in the
US each making more than a million in profits in that month, it is certainly
the sort of question that bears close examination. </P>

<P>What will we do with all the grayness in our lives? Will we take a stand
anywhere? I think we should, whenever we feel strongly. I think that if
we can begin to take a stand on some of the moral issues related to viruses,
that some of the grayness will recede, and other issues will become more
clear. </P>

<P>I believe that it is wrong to write a virus, particularly one which
is not easily detected and/or includes any destructive code within it.
I am not sure that all viruses are equally &quot;bad&quot;. For instance,
a virus that provides obvious evidence of its presence (such as Flip or
Devils Dance) or a virus that is written to carefully avoid a user's data
(such as Brain or Farm) is somehow less bad than a virus that employs stealth
techniques, targets anti-virus products or user files, and contains destructive
code. Nevertheless, I believe that there are no &quot;good&quot; viruses,
and thus all viruses are bad, and that writing a virus, therefore, is a
bad thing . </P>

<P>If that is true, then you can understand my feelings about those who
would teach how to write a virus. Teaching how to write a virus is possibly
worse than writing one directly, for from each teacher can come dozens
or thousands of students busy writing viruses. Books about how to write
a virus, whether well-done or poorly done, are as bad as their subject
matter, and the authors are as bad as their books. </P>

<P>If vi}uses are bad, then the distribution of them is too. Thus the BBS
that distributes viruses, the vendor who shares them with a potential customer,
or the teenager who offers them to friends or strangers, for free or for
a fee, is bad. </P>

<P>What isn't clear is whether my notions of good and bad can somehow account
for why I think it is good for me to share a new virus I have received
with Fridrik Skulason or Vesselin Bontchev or Alan Solomon. I think I must
be guided, somehow, by the notion that none of those I call good would
call this bad. I am guided, I think, by the notion that they agree with
me, more or less, in what I've said so far in this column, and that they
would not write a virus, place a virus in another's computer, run a virus
BBS, sell a virus to the public, give a virus to a customer, write a book
about how to write viruses, etc. Instead, they have dedicated their lives
to the task of destroying viruses and protecting users. The virus author
is dedicated to the opposite set of tasks. </P>

<P>In my black and white world, you are either part of my gang, or my gang
is going to get you. If you run a virus BBS, we will shut you down. If
you write a book about how to write viruses, we will black list and boycott
you. If you are a vendor who gives viruses to customers, we hope to somehow
repay you for this misdeeds </P>

<P>But anyone who notices moral issues finds themselves frequently with
one morality interfering with another. Consider how much we value freedom
of speech, then rethink the problem of writing a book about how to write
a virus. </P>

<P>How much do we value freedom of speech? How much do we value the information
in our computers? How much do we value being in control of our computers?
I recently had an opportunity to debate Mark Ludwig, the author of a nasty
little book which explains how to write a computer virus. I'm not sure
who won the debate, since the audience was already on my side, Mr. Ludwig
hardly fought back, and surely did not present any compelling arguments
for writing such books. </P>

<P>I've read the book, as you probably will. I think it is well-written,
and certainly useful to anyone who wants to write a virus. </P>

<P>During the debate, Mr. Ludwig suggested that the book might be of help
to those who wish to understand viruses. I'm not sure this is the case,
because it doesn't talk about any of those now roaming the earth. The Ludwig
viruses use a variety of interesting techniques, which, while not novel,
are not necessarily those used by the common viruses, either. Understand
everything in the book, and you still won't know a scrap about Jerusalem
or Stoned. </P>

<P>Mr. Ludwig also contended that the book would be helpful to managers
who need to defend against viruses. Hardly. There is no explanation provided
as to how to defend against a virus, and he suggests a low-level destructive
format of your hard disk as a means of removing one of the file viruses
presented! </P>

<P>It seems to us that Mr. Ludwig's motives are revolutionary: &quot;It
is inevitable that these books will offend some people. In fact, I hope
they do... Our leaders... are busy trying to centralize all power into
their own hands... Truth seekers and wise men have been persecuted by powerful
idiots in every age...&quot; He would seem to be calling for the violent
overthrow of the computer using establishment. For instance, on page 51,
he writes &quot;one could write a routine called DESTROY, which would wreak
all kinds of havoc, and then code it in like this... if one wanted to do
damage only after a successful infection took place, or like this... if
one wanted the damage to always take place, no matter what, or like this...
ii one wanted damage to occur only in the event that the virus did not
find a file to infect, etc., etc.&quot; I stand, in my old age, among the
counter-revolutionaries. </P>

<P>Mr. Ludwig's book raises the question of how much evil we may say in
print or sell on disk. For a small fee he will send you a disk with all
the viruses in his book-a great convenience to virus authors who don't
have the time to read his book, and just want to get busy infecting the
office. Thus Ludwig also raises the question of whether it should be legal
to create or sell computer viruses. We think not, and in this issue you
will find model legislation that would make such practices unlawful. </P>

<P>I am inclined to think that your freedom to swing your fist ends at
my nose. Freedom of speech should not imperil our data any more than our
data should imperil your free speech. </P>

<P>The world has had a history of book burning and suppression. None of
us has fond memories of Senator McCarthy or the Nazis. What we have not
yet had is a history of data destruction. In your computer, Mr. Ludwig's
viruses perform the electronic equivalent of book burning. While he shouldn't
want us to burn his book (until we've paid for it), we shouldn't feel kindly
when his viruses bum our electronic information. </P>

<P>I hope that Mr. Ludwig will stop shipping his current book. I hope Mr.
Ludwig will not write his other promised books on viruses, one of which
&quot;will probe military strategies and real-life attacks, and dig into
the development of viral weapon systems, defeating anti-viral defenses,
etc.&quot; I hope he will join our side, with a useful book on how to defeat
viruses. I hope that Mr. Ludwig will contribute some of the proceeds from
the income on his first book to a User Defense Fund that will be used to
help develop anti-virus legislation, prosecute virus authors, and develop
public domain anti-virus products. </P>

<P>If my hopes are not fulfilled, then we will have to do something more.
We already have enough problems in our computers. There is no need to teach
folks how to create more. </P>
