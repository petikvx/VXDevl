<p> Part confession. Part job interview. Part Oprah. That was the final, controversial 
  session on day one of the seventh international <a target=_top href="http://www.virusbtn.com">Virus 
  Bulletin</a> Conference in San Francisco's landmark Fairmont Hotel. 
<p> 
<p>&nbsp; 
Facing a roomful of grumbling, skeptical antivirus programmers was Mike Ellison, 
a quiet, twentysomething, Bay Area-based computer programmer with a ponytail. 
<p> 
<p> Why so skeptical? 
<p> 
<p> Simple. Ellison is not just any mild-mannered geek. He's <a href="ivsbring.htm">Stormbringer</a>, 
  an award-winning virus writer from the now-retired <a href="groups2.htm#PS">Phalcon/SKISM</a> 
  clan whose viruses and virus tutorials have been published in the <b>Little 
  Black Book of Computer Viruses</b> and, on at least one occasion, unleashed 
  upon the computer world. 
<p> 
<p> Like most virus writers, Ellison did his best work as a teenager, starting 
  at the tender age of 14. Unlike many virus writers-- who turn 21, get a job, 
  and quietly find less sociopathic forms of entertainment-- when Ellison retired, 
  he went public with a mea culpa newsgroup posting. 
<p> 
<p> Three years later, Ellison has gone public again. Standing at the dais in 
  one of the Fairmont's Transylvanian-style ballrooms before an international 
  gathering of the antivirus community, some of whom consider him a terrorist, 
  he handed down a paper titled "Defecting From the Underground: Are Ex-Virus 
  Writers of Use to the Antivirus Industry?" 
<p> 
<p> Delivered in a quiet, measured voice, Ellison's paper ranged from confessional 
  to evangelical: 
<p> 
<p> 
<blockquote> 
  <p> I, like many of my peers, was rebellious and anti-establishment at that 
    age &#91;14&#93;; only I became interested in computer viruses. They had a 
    dark, forbidden allure which at that age is hard to resist.... 
  <p> 
  <p> I wrote viruses for the knowledge, the challenge, and, admittedly, the fame. 
    At the time I saw it as something of a chess game with antivirus programmers. 
    However, I did not have any desire to harm the public.... 
  <p> 
  <p> Ethically, I knew that releasing viruses into the wild was wrong. I would 
    not release them myself.... Eventually, one of my viruses hit someone's machine. 
    Some vengeful person compiled it and deliberately infected the person's computer.... 
    That morning I quit writing viruses and have kept my vow ever since." 
  <p> 
</blockquote>
<p> 
<p> In essence, Ellison was asking for the antivirus industry's forgiveness-- 
  and a job. That's right. After going straight for three years, the reformed 
  virus writer says he wants to switch sides and become an antivirus programmer 
  "to give something back." 
<p> 
<p> Needless to say, Ellison's planned career change caused some heartburn among 
  conference goers. The consensus among antivirus programmers seemed to be "Fine, 
  stop writing viruses, but don't expect us to hire you." 
<p> 
<p> "Would you hire a former bank robber as bank manager?" explained one attendee. 
  Some programmers thought that Ellison shouldn't even have been given a forum. 
<p> 
<p> 
<p> It's easy to understand why it is considered "taboo"-- as Ellison puts it-- 
  for antivirus companies to hire former virus writers. Currently, there are some 
  17,000 computer viruses gumming up the world's computers, and the number is 
  rising. In turn, this epidemic of viruses, which exploded with the popularization 
  of the Net, has resulted in a booming trade in antivirus software products. 
  The weekend hobby of a generation of antisocial teenagers has inadvertently 
  sired a billion-dollar industry. 
<p> 
<p> With that in mind, antivirus companies are loath to do anything-- such as 
  hiring former virus writers-- that might undermine public confidence or damage 
  the industry's credibility. After all, hiring virus writers could lead to the 
  impression that the industry is creating its own market. 
<p> 
<p> Ellison, who has been knocked back for jobs in antivirus companies, is well 
  aware of this mindset. Switching from confessional to evangelical, he made a 
  pitch for antivirus professionals to engage in reasonable discussions with their 
  teenage opponents rather than indulging in "petty insults and name calling." 
<p> 
<p> "It seems like many of the professional antivirus programmers don't really 
  take the effort to get to know their enemies and see who they are," Ellison 
  said. Recruiting former virus writers-- much like the hiring of ex-hackers in 
  the computer security field-- would increase the industry's understanding of 
  what makes virus writers tick, as well as take advantage of the writers' inside 
  knowledge of viruses. 
<p> 
<p> "While I'll agree that the majority of people creating new variants of viruses 
  can't program their way out of a paper bag, how many 16-year-old kids do you 
  know that have the interrupt tables of opcode charts of DOS 80X86 machines memorized?" 
  he said. "Some of these people are quite sharp and have considerable talent." 
<p> 
<p> Although politely received, Ellison's argument was vigorously rebuffed during 
  the 1 session. Antivirus writer after antivirus writer stood, clasping the microphone 
  like a member of a TV talk show audience and, after commending Ellison for turning 
  from the dark side of the Force, told him why he should stay out of the industry. 
<p> 
<p> Conference speaker Vesselin Bontchev, who delivered the "Macro Virus Identification 
  Problems" paper, led the charge. "If your intention was to convince me that 
  antivirus companies should hire you, I am sorry, but you have failed miserably," 
  Bontchev said. "Compared to the average antivirus programmer, your knowledge 
  is virtually nil. We don't sit around all day with our legs crossed waiting 
  for you to help us.... You have done something in the past that we consider 
  to be wrong. We are just not going to trust you." 
<p> 
<p> Other programmers rose to elaborate on Bontchev's we-don't-need-you spiel. 
  More than one naysayer suggested that, if he was serious, Ellison should evangelize 
  the virus writers-- convince them to lay down their keyboards and come in from 
  the cold. 
<p> 
<p> Finally, after a 30-minute debate, the session's convenor decided to try a 
  straw poll. He asked the audience members how, as customers, they would feel 
  about an antivirus software produced by a company with former virus writers. 
  Negative? No raised hands. Not negative? A lot of hands. Positive? Half of a 
  lot of hands. "You're hired!" someone yelled from the audience. 
<p> 
<p> Perhaps. Then again, the convenor didn't let the antivirus programmers vote.
