<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Macro viruses are not a new concept - they were predicted as early as
the late eighties. At that time, the first studies about the possibility
of writing viruses with the macro languages of certain applications were
made. </P>

<P>However, macro viruses are not just a theory any more. Currently, there
are several known macro viruses. They have all been written with WordBasic,
the powerful macro language of Microsoft Word. These viruses spread through
Word documents - Word's advanced template system makes it an opportune
environment for viral mischief. This is problematic, because people exchange
document a lot more than executables or floppy disks. Macro viruses are
also very easy to create or modify. </P>

<P>Although other word processors like WordPerfect and Ami Pro do support
reading Word documents, they can not be infected by these viruses. It is
not impossible to write similar viruses for these systems, however. <A NAME="dmv"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/DMV</H2>

<P>WordMacro/DMV is probably the first Word macro virus to have been written.
It is test virus, written by a person called Joel McNamara to study the
behavior of macro viruses. As such, it is no threat - it announces its
presence in the system, and keeps the user informed of its actions. </P>

<P>Mr. McNamara wrote WordMacro/DMV in fall 1994 - at the same time, he
published a detailed study about macro viruses. He kept his test virus
under wraps until a real macro virus, WordMacro/Concept, was discovered.
At that time, he decided to make WordMacro/DMV known to the public. We
oppose to such behaviour; although it can be argued that spreading such
information will educate the public, we can also except to see new variants
of the DMV virus, as well as totally new viruses inspired by the techniques
used in this virus. McNamara also published a skeleton for a virus to infect
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files. </P>

<P>F-PROT Professional 2.20 is able to the detect the WordMacro/DMV macro
virus. <A NAME="concept"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/Concept</H2>

<P>WordMacro/Concept - also known as Word Prank Macro or WW6Macro - is
a real macro virus which has been written with the Microsoft Word v6.x
macro language. It has been reported in several countries, and seems to
have no trouble propagating in the wild. </P>

<P>WordMacro/Concept consists of several Word macros. Since Word macros
are carried with Word documents themselves, the virus is able to spread
through document files. This is a quite ominous development - so far, people
have only had to worry about infections in their program files. The situation
is made worse by the fact that WordMacro/Concept is also able to function
with Microsoft Word for Windows 6.x and 7.x, Word for Macintosh 6.x, as
well as in Windows 95 and Windows NT environments. It is, truly, the first
functional multi-environment virus, although it can be argued that the
effective operating system of this virus is Microsoft Word, not Windows
or MacOS. </P>

<P>The virus gets executed every time an infected document is opened. It
tries to infect Word's global document template, NORMAL.DOT (which is also
capable of holding macros). If it finds either the macro &quot;PayLoad&quot;
or &quot;FileSaveAs&quot; already on the template, it assumes that the
template is already infected and ceases its functioning. </P>

<P>If the virus does not find &quot;PayLoad&quot; or &quot;FileSaveAs&quot;
in NORMAL.DOT, it starts copies the viral macros to the template and displays
a small dialog box on the screen. The box contains the number &quot;1&quot;
and an &quot;OK&quot; button, and its title bar identifies it as a Word
dialog box. This effect seems to have been meant to act as a generation
counter, but it does not work as intended. This dialog is only shown during
the initial infection of NORMAL.DOT. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="concept1.gif" HEIGHT=122 WIDTH=165></P></CENTER>

<P>After the virus has managed to infect the global template, it infects
all documents that are created with the <I>File/Save As</I> command. It
is then able to spread to other systems on these documents - when a user
opens an infected document on a clean system, the virus will infect the
global document template. </P>

<P>The virus consists of the following macros: </P>

<UL>
<P>AAAZAO<BR>
AAAZFS<BR>
AutoOpen<BR>
FileSaveAs<BR>
PayLoad</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="concept2.gif" HEIGHT=341 WIDTH=338> </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><I>Picture of the macro list in an infected machine</I> </P></CENTER>

<P>Note that &quot;AutoOpen&quot; and &quot;FileSaveAs&quot; are legitimate
macro names, and some users may already have attached these macros to their
documents and templates. In this context, &quot;PayLoad&quot; sounds very
ominous. It contains the text: </P>

<PRE>        Sub MAIN

                REM That's enough to prove my point

        End Sub

</PRE>

<P>However, the &quot;PayLoad&quot; macro is not executed at any time.
</P>

<P>You can detect the presence of the WordMacro/Concept macro virus in
your system by simply selecting the command Macro from Word's Tools menu.
If the macro list contains a macro named &quot;AAAZFS&quot;, your system
is infected. </P>

<P>You could prevent the virus from infecting your system by creating a
macro named &quot;PayLoad&quot; that doesn't have to do anything. The virus
will then consider your system already infected, and will not try to infect
the global template NORMAL.DOT. This is only a temporary solution, though
- somebody may modify the viruse's &quot;AutoOpen&quot; macro to infect
the system regardless of whether NORMAL.DOT contains the macros &quot;FileSaveAs&quot;
or &quot;PayLoad&quot;. </P>

<P>Concept replicates only on English versions of Word. However, one translated
version to operate on French Word has been found. This variant is known
as WordMacro/Concept.Fr. </P>

<P>F-PROT Profesional is able to the detect the WordMacro/Concept macro
virus. <A NAME="nuclear"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/Nuclear</H2>

<P>WordMacro/Nuclear was recently discovered. Like WordMacro/DMV and WordMacro/Concept,
it spreads through Microsoft Word documents. The new virus was first spotted
on a FTP site in Internet, in a publicly accessible area which has in the
past been a notorious distribution site for viral code. Apparently, the
viruse's distributor has some sense of irony; the virus was attached to
a document which described an earlier Word macro virus, WordMacro/Concept.
</P>

<P>Whereas WordMacro/DMV is a test virus and WordMacro/Concept is only
potentially harmful, WordMacro/Nuclear is destructive, harmful and generally
obnoxious. It consists of a number of Word macros attached to documents.
When an infected document is opened, the virus is executed and tries to
infect Word's global document template, NORMAL.DOT. </P>

<P>Unlike WordMacro/Concept - which pops up a dialogue box when it infects
NORMAL.DOT - WordMacro/Nuclear does not announce its arrival in the system.
Instead, it lays low and infects every document created with the <I>File/Save
As</I> command by attaching its own macros to it. The virus tries to hide
its presence by switching off the &quot;Prompt to save NORMAL.DOT&quot;
option (in the Options dialogue, opened from Tools menu) every time a document
is closed. That way, the user is no longer asked whether changes in NORMAL.DOT
should be saved, and the virus is that more likely to go unnoticed. Many
users relied on this option to protect themselves against the WordMacro/Concept
virus, but it obviouisly no longer works against Nuclear. </P>

<P>WordMacro/Nuclear contains several potentially destructive and irritating
routines. The next time Word is started after initial infection, one of
its constituent macros, &quot;DropSuriv&quot;, looks up the time in the
computer's clock. If the time is between 17.00 and 17.59, the virus tries
to inject a more traditional DOS/Windows file virus called &quot;Ph33r&quot;
into the system (as the viruse's author has commented in the viruse's code:
&quot;5PM - approx time before work is finished&quot;). &quot;Suriv&quot;
is, of course, &quot;Virus&quot; spelled backwards. However, due to an
error, this routine does not work as intended in any of the popular operating
environments. </P>

<P>Another of the viruse's macros, &quot;PayLoad&quot;, tries to delete
the computer's system files IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM whenever
the date is fifth of April. This attempt will fail due a programming error
(virus authors never test drive the destructive parts of their code, it
seems). And finally, the virus adds the following two lines: </P>

<PRE>        And finally I would like to say:

        STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC

</PRE>

<P>at the end of any document printed or faxed from Word during the last
five seconds of any minute. Since the text is added at print-time only,
the user is unlikely to notice this embarassing change. This function is
handled by the viral macro &quot;InsertPayload&quot;. </P>

<P>The virus can be detected by selecting the Macro command from the Tools
menu and checking whether the macro list contains any curiously named macros.
&quot;DropSuriv&quot; and &quot;InsertPayload&quot; are obvious giveaways.
</P>

<P>F-PROT Professional 2.20 is able to the detect the WordMacro/Nuclear
virus. <A NAME="colors"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/Colors</H2>

<P>This macro virus was posted to a usenet newsgroup on the 14th of October,
1995. It is also known as the Rainbow virus. This macro virus infectes
Word documents in a similar manner as the previous Word macro viruses,
except that it does not rely only on the auto-execute macros to operate.
Thus, this virus will be able to execute even if the automacros are turned
off. Colors contains the following macros: </P>

<UL>
<P>AutoClose<BR>
AutoExec<BR>
AutoOpen<BR>
FileExit<BR>
FileNew<BR>
FileSave<BR>
FileSaveAs<BR>
ToolsMacro<BR>
macros</P>
</UL>

<P>All macros are encrypted with the standard Word execute-only feature.
</P>

<P>When an infected document is opened, the virus will execute when user:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Creates a new file </LI>

<LI>Closes the infected file </LI>

<LI>Saves the file (autosave does this automatically after the infected
document has been open for some time) </LI>

<LI>Lists macros with the Tools/Macro command </LI>
</UL>

<P>It is important <B>not to use the Tools/Macro command</B> to check if
you are infected with this virus, as you will just execute the virus while
doing this. Instead, use File/Templates/Organizer/Macros command to detect
and delete the offending macros. Do note that a future macro virus will
probably subvert this command as well. </P>

<P>The virus maintains a generation counter in WIN.INI, where a line &quot;countersu
=&quot; in the [windows] part is increased during the execution of the
macros. After every 300rd increments the virus will modify the system color
settings; the colors of different Windows objects will be changed to random
colors after next boot-up. This activation routine will not work under
Microsoft Word for Macintosh. </P>

<P>It is interesting to note that the AutoExec macro in the virus is empty.
It is probably included just to overwrite an existing AutoExec macro -
which might contain some antivirus routines. WordMacro/Colors also enables
the automatic execution of automacros if they have been disabled, and turns
off the 'prompt to save changes to NORMAL.DOT' feature, both of which have
been used to fight macro viruses. </P>

<P>WordMacro/Colors seems to be carefully written; The virus even has a
debug mode built-in. The virus is probably written in Portugal. </P>

<P>F-PROT Professional 2.21 is able to the detect the WordMacro/Colors
macro virus. <A NAME="hot"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/Hot</H2>

<P>WordMacro/Hot was the first Word macro virus written in Russia. It was
found in the wild over there in January 1996. </P>

<P>Hot spreads in a similar manner as the <A HREF="#concept">WordMacro/Concept</A>
virus: when an infected DOC is first opened, virus modifies the NORMAL.DOT
file, and will spread to other documents after that. </P>

<P>Unlike the earlier Word macro viruses, Hot does not replicate with the
<I>File/Save As</I> command - it infects only during the basic <I>File/Save</I>
command. This means that Hot will infect only existing documents in the
system - not new ones. </P>

<P>Infected documents contain the following four macros, which are visible
in the macro list: </P>

<UL>
<LI>AutoOpen </LI>

<LI>DrawBringInFrOut </LI>

<LI>InsertPBreak </LI>

<LI>ToolsRepaginat </LI>
</UL>

<P>When Hot infects NORMAL.DOT, it renames these macros to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>StartOfDoc </LI>

<LI>AutoOpen </LI>

<LI>InsertPageBreak </LI>

<LI>FileSave </LI>
</UL>

<P>Macros have been saved with the 'execute-only' feature, which means
that a user can't view or edit them. </P>

<P>WordMacro/Hot contains a counter. It adds a line like this to the WINWORD6.INI
file: </P>

<PRE>        QLHot=35112

</PRE>

<P>This number is based on the number of days during this century. Hot
adds 14 to this number and then waits until this latency time of 14 days
has passed. Hot will spread normally during this time, it will just not
activate. </P>

<P>After the 14 day pause, there is a 1 in 7 chance that a document will
be erased when it is opened. Virus will delete all text and re-save the
document. Hot does not do this, if it find a file called EGA5.CPI from
the C:\DOS directory. A comment in the source code of the virus hints that
this feature is added so that the author of the virus and his friends can
protect themselves from the activation damage: </P>

<PRE>  '---------------------------------------------------------------

  '- Main danger section: if TodayNo=(QLHotDateNo + RndDateNo) ---

  '- and if File C:DOSega5.cpi not exist (not for OUR friends) -

  '---------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>

<P>By default, there is no file by the name EGA5.CPI in MS-DOS distributions.
</P>

<P>WordMacro/Hot was the first macro virus to use external functions. This
system allows Word macros to call any standard Windows API call. The use
of external functions is specific to Windows 3.1x means that WordMacro/Hot
will be unable to spread under Word for Macintosh or Word 7 for Windows
95: opening an infected document will just produce an error message. </P>

<P>F-PROT Professional 2.21a is able to detect the WordMacro/Hot virus.
<A NAME="atom"></A></P>

<H2>WordMacro/Atom</H2>

<P>WordMacro/Atom was found in February 1996. It's operating mechanism
is quite similar to <A HREF="#concept">WordMacro/Concept</A>, with the
following differences: </P>

<UL>
<LI>All the macros in this virus are encrypted (Word's <I>execute-only</I>
feature) </LI>

<LI>The virus replicates during file openings as well, in addition to saving
files </LI>

<LI>The virus has two destructive payloads </LI>
</UL>

<P>First activation happens when the date is December 13th. At this date
the virus attempts to delete all files in the current directory. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="atom.gif" HEIGHT=121 WIDTH=297 ALIGN=RIGHT> Second activation
happens when a <I>File/Save As</I> command is issued and the seconds of
the clock are equal to 13. If so, the virus will password-protect the document,
making it unaccesible to the user in the future. The password is set to
be <B>ATOM#1</B>. </P>

<P>It is not easy to give a search string for this virus: some of the replicants
are usually in files password-protected by the virus, and thus contain
no constant user-definable search string. </P>

<P>Disabling automacros will make Atom unable to execute and spread. Turning
on the <I>Prompt to save NORMAL.DOT</I> setting will make Atom unable to
infect NORMAL.DOT, but it will still be able to infect documents that are
opened or saved during the same Word session. </P>

<P>WordMacro/Atom is not known to be in the wild. <A NAME="other"></A></P>

<H2>Other Word macro viruses and trojans</H2>

1995 and January 1997: </P>

<P>WordMacro/Wazzu consists of a single AutoOpen macro; this makes it language
independent, ie. this macro virus is able to infect localized versions
of Word as well as the english Word. </P>

<P>Unlike most other macro viruses, Wazzu has really been seen in the wild,
and it is considered common nowadays. </P>

<P>Wazzu modifies the contents of documents it infects, moving words around
and inserting the text 'wazzu '. Word Wazzu is reported to be a nickname
for the Washington State University. </P>

<P>There exists also several trojans written in the Word macro language.
These typically delete data as soon as the trojanized document is open.
Since these do not spread by themselves, they are not widespread and not
considered to be a significant threat. </P>

<P>Some known macro trojans are <I>WordTrojan/FormatC, WordTrojan/WeideroffnenC,
WordTrojan/Concept.L.Drp and WordTrojan/Concept.M.Drp</I>. </P>

<P><A NAME="protect"></A></P>

<H2>Protecting yourself against Word macro viruses</H2>

<P>There is a generic way to protect your Word against some of the known
macro viruses. <I>However, this should not be relied on alone, as it can
not stop even all known macro viruses</I>. Select the command Macro from
the Tools menu and create a new macro called &quot;AutoExec&quot;. Write
the following commands to the macro and save it: </P>

<PRE>Sub MAIN

        DisableAutoMacros

        MsgBox &quot;AutoMacros are now turned off.&quot;, &quot;Virus protection&quot;, 64

End Sub

</PRE>

<P>This macro will be executed automatically when Word starts. It will
disable the feature which viruses like Concept, DMV and Nuclear use to
attack the system. However, there are ways to create macro viruses that
are able to bypass such protection. </P>

<P>Only some of currently known Word macro viruses are able to infect nationalized
versions on Word. In these programs, the macro language commands have been
translated to the national language, and therefore macros created with
the English version of Word will not work. Since these viruses consists
of macros, they will be unable to function. However, viruses like DMV or
Wazzu are able to spread in any version of Word. <A NAME="f-prot"></A></P>

<H2>F-PROT and Word macro viruses</H2>

<P>F-PROT has been able to detect Word macro viruses since October 1995.
</P>

<P>Unlike the limited free version of F-PROT, <B>F-PROT Professional</B>
is able to disinfect macro viruses automatically with it's built-in scanning
engine. The limited version of F-PROT includes a separate F-MACROW utility
which can be used to detect and disinfect macro viruses. </P>

<P>F-PROT Professional for Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2 as
well as the realtime Windows VxD scanners have these macro scanning features
built in to their normal scanners. </P>

<P>If you are running a VxD-based background protection from the F-PROT
