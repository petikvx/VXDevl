<P><B>Abstract </B></P>

<P>This paper presents four case studies of individuals involved in virus
writing. The research was conducted by using surveys, and by conducting
interviews via e-mail (electronic mail), electronic chat and in-person
sessions. Ethnographic and demographic data was collected, as well as information
relating to how the individuals view their relationships to their peers
and to society in general. Some data relating to cognitive reasoning abilities
was collected. This data was used to examine the individuals' moral development
in light of ethical and moral developmen- tal models based on the research
of Lawrence Kohlberg. Gender based issues in virus writing are examined
using the model developed by Gilligan. </P>

<P><B>Introduction </B></P>

<P>In any area of scientific investigation, there is the danger of overgeneralisation
and stereotyping. In the case of virus writers, one manifestation of this
danger is that of assuming that there is some homogeneous group of people
who write viruses, and that it is possible to talk about the psychology
of 'the' virus writer. In reality, there are different types of virus writers,
each with his own nature, circumstances, skills and ambitions. This paper
will not attempt to be all-inclusive; it will examine three 'types' of
virus writers by using case studies of individuals who fit into these categories:
</P>

<UL>
<P>(a) the young adolescent individual </P>

<P>(b) the college student </P>

<P>(c) the adult/professionally employed individual. </P>
</UL>

<P>We will try to shed some light on the differences in their make-up,
and thus to assess the difference in the nature of any danger posed by
each of them. If the virus writing population is not as homogeneous as
some may assume it is, then monolithic solutions to 'the problem' (such
as blanket or overkill legislation, certain forms of ethical solutions)
may well be much less effective than is being assumed in certain quarters.
We will observe differences in how they think, how they operate, and in
how they view the rest of the world. </P>

<P>We will also look at the ways in which people may progress through these
classes. This progression will lead us to a fourth category: </P>

<UL>
<P>(d) the mature reformed ex-writer of viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P>While the last category is often ignored (since the apparent threat
is gone) it needs to be considered with as much care as the other three
types. Not only are people of this fourth category potentially very skilled
technically in the defence of cyberspace against members of the other three
categories, but they also represent the kind of people into which we hope
members of the other three categories will develop. </P>

<P>The virus writer has been characterized by some as a bad, evil, depraved,
maniac; terrorist, technopathic, genius gone mad, sociopath. This image
has been heightened not only by the media, but by the some of the actions
of the virus writers themselves. Public communications from the writers,
in the form of echo-mail messages, often seem to indicate they are intent
on doing as much damage as humanly possible. Their electronic publica-
tions have in the past reinforced this, and the very fact that they release
viruses may seem to confirm it: these people are bad. This paper argues
that this is a gross oversimplification of the situation, and that the
virus writing aspect of these individuals is not sufficient to characterize
them into one group simply labelled 'unethical people'. </P>

<P>We will show that virus writers are not all the same as each other as
far as their stages of ethical and moral development; we will show that
some virus writers are within normal ethical developmental model ranges
as defined by Lawrence Kohlberg's model of moral development. </P>

<P><B>The Generic Virus Writer </B></P>

<P>Stereotyping is pervasive. It is especially prevalent when a new kind
of entity emerges, or a new kind of person. As there is little reliable
information about such new kinds of people, differentiating between them
is difficult. Thus, there is a tendency to assume not only that there is
some stereotype, but also that anyone who can be classified as belonging
to the newly perceived group is to all intents and purposes like all the
other members of that group. This often happens when the newly emergent
group is primarily composed of young people. </P>

<P>Moreover, such stereotyping is often accompanied by generalised value
judgements. In the case of virus writers, a common assumption is that they
are all bad. While it is certainly true that the distribution of malicious
software is a bad act, and that many virus writers are motivated by bad
or even criminal intentions and desires, it is dangerous to assume that
this is true of every person who ever writes a program that can be classified
as a virus. The problem of dealing with the danger posed by the distribution
of malicious software is not simplified by failing to recognise that the
people who write viruses do not form a homogeneous group. They are a diverse
group. If we are to address the problem, we must first recognise its true
nature. We must discover how different virus writers operate, and how they
are as people. To this end, we will examine similarities and differences
of four individuals involved in the virus writing culture. </P>

<P><B>Ethical models </B></P>

<P>Ethics is sometimes promoted as one solution to the problem of people
writing viruses. To explore what part ethics may play in virus writing,
we will examine four virus writers using a model of ethical/moral development
as a base for comparison. We chose to use a model of ethical development
that was universal and longitudinal. virus writers come from diverse cultures,
so the use of a universal model is desirable. We chose Kohlberg's model
for its universal characteristics. The research done by Kohlberg was not
only cross-cultural but longitudinal; it was performed over a time period
of 12 years. Based on this research, he designed a six-step ethical classification
model, which shows a fixed sequence of changing responses with increasing
age. It has been shown to be based on experimental and longitudinal evidence,
and is based on 'methods of thinking' rather than individual actions or
decisions. </P>

<P><B>Kohlberg's model </B></P>

<P>Kohlberg's ethical model provides age trends in three moral levels of
development, with two stages within each level. These levels/stages of
development are defined as: </P>

<UL>
<P>Level 1: Pre-conventional morality. At this level, morals are external.
</P>

<UL>
<P>Stage 1:<BR>
The first stage consists of the punishment and obedience orientation (i.e.
there are no real rules; the seriousness of a 'bad' act depends on the
consequence of the act). This stage is sometimes referred to as the punishment
orientation stage. 'Right' is being obedient to power and avoiding punishment
at all costs. </P>

<P>Stage 2:<BR>
In stage two, instrumental orientation surfaces (being good to get a reward
or satisfy a need). In Kohlberg's study, 80 percent of moral judgements
of ten year-olds are in this category. This stage is sometimes called the
naive reward orientation stage. 'Right' behaviours include taking responsibility
for oneself, and letting others take responsibility for themselves. </P>
</UL>

<P>Level 2: Conventional morality. Parents, social groups and peers play
a large role of influence at this level. Being 'good' is important. Rules
may appear 'internalized', but they may be internalized to avoid punishment
or to gain the approval of others. </P>

<UL>
<P>Stage 3:<BR>
In the third stage of development, actions are judged on the merit of their
intent. A person has to be able to recognize the point of view of others
to progress into this stage. This stage can be referred to as the good-boy/good-girl
orientation. 'Right' is having a right motive, and a concern for others.
</P>

<P>Stage 4:<BR>
In the fourth stage, one 'accepts authority', not only because of the possibility
of punishment, but out of a sense of duty to obey rules and maintain social
order. This stage represents authority orientation. The rules of a society
are important in this state: 'Right' is keeping the rules of the society.
</P>
</UL>

<P>Level 3: Post-conventional morality. Self-accepted moral principles
are the mark of this level. In stage five and six, morals are internalized.
The stages in level three involve development of personal codes of ethics.
</P>

<UL>
<P>Stage 5:<BR>
Judgements become more flexible in stage five. Rules must be impartial,
and 'The Welfare of the Many' becomes paramount. This stage is sometimes
referred to as the social-contract orientation stage. 'Right' is keeping
the contract. </P>

<P>Stage 6:<BR>
In stage six, the individual defines right and wrong on the basis of his/her
own ethical principles. Normative ethics, based on self-chosen principles
are applied in all situations. This form of development is consistent with
the ability to perform formal operations (the highest level of cognitive
development). This stage represents the morality of conscience. 'Right'
is an obligation to the universal principles of equality, justice and respect
for persons. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>[Stage 6 may be viewed as a hypothetical construct as no group seems
consistently able to fit in this slot; in fact, this state is often eliminated
from some versions of the model. It is however, a desirable stage, and
it is possible for some people to function at this level some of the time.]
</P>

<P><B>Gender Issues </B></P>

<P>While Kohlberg's model is well suited for the purposes of this study,
the Gilligan model can be helpful in addressing gender issues of virus
writing from the standpoint of ethical development. </P>

<P>In conversations with dozens of individuals involved in the virus writing
culture, we have found only two instances of 'direct' female involvement.
One was the girlfriend of a virus writer, and one was a woman who was involved
with the virus writing group NuKE. However, it is uncertain as to whether
or not she ever produced any viruses. According to Gilligan, females progress
through different states of moral reasoning. 'Females are socialized to
equate 'goodness' with self-sacrifice more than are males'. Gilligan's
three stages of moral development are described in the next section. </P>

<P>Gilligan's model </P>

<UL>
<P>Stage 1: Self-interest. At this stage the needs of others are ignored.
</P>

<P>Stage 2: Self-sacrifice. At this stage, women sacrifice their own needs/desires
for the well-being of others. </P>

<P>Stage 3: Non-violence, mature thinking; compassion and universal good.
</P>
</UL>

<P>Gilligan states that while male and female children go through stages
of being subject to parental authority and then peer pressure (where right
and wrong are determined by the groups they belong to), females do not
progress through the utilitarian and deontological stages. Instead, they
view moral decisions in terms of human interdependency and needs as well
as justice and rights. Females involved in the virus writing culture are
typically treated as inferior by a disproportionate number of members of
the culture. Sexual slurs and harassment are common. Women in this culture
do not appear to be able to pursue their goals independently of men. There
appears to be little attention to concepts of equality, or even a pseudo-equality.
</P>

<P>While there are opponents to her theory, we propose it would help partially
explain the marked absence of female virus writers. </P>

<P><B>Methodology </B></P>

<P>While we had access to a varied population of virus writers, and the
opportunity to draw a sample from the population, the measurement of the
sample proved to be extremely complex. Rather than use computed descriptive
statistics to make only inferences about the similarities within the population,
we also chose to examine the differences by using case studies. </P>

<P>We have adopted an inductive approach so that we can learn who the 'generic
virus writer' might be by observing instances of actual virus writers.
We believe this is a more sound approach than trying to produce a characteristic
profile to which actual writers can later be matched. We wished to avoid
making many assumptions about what might or might not be in such a characteristic
profile until we had examined some real cases. </P>

<P>The virus writing community is relatively small in comparison with other
underground communities such as the hacking and phreaking communities.
There is no way to define the population exactly; however, if we consider
viruses that are known to exist, we can estimate there could be at most
4500 virus writers, if one person wrote each virus. We know that more than
a few of the viruses are written by the same person. For instance, there
are a number of viruses that are known to have been written by someone
calling himself Dark Avenger; so, not each of the viruses we know may have
an individual author. </P>

<P>When we look at the viruses 'in the wild' as opposed to research viruses
or viruses which are only sent to product development companies for inclusion
in virus scanners, we find approximately 150 examples. Of those, if we
estimate 100 as by different individuals, the responses we gathered would
constitute response by approximately half the writers of viruses 'in the
wild'. Of course, we have no way of knowing exactly who wrote what, or
if all of our respondents actually did write the viruses they claim. It
is quite possible that there were respondents who merely wished to participate,
or who in fact deliberately wished to bias or discredit this study. However,
we do know that of our four case studies, every one of them has authored
viruses that have appeared in the wild. </P>

<P>We distributed the survey directly to 47 virus writers known to us.
From those 47, we received 18 individual responses to the survey, which
was distributed to underground bulletin boards in the United States, Germany,
Australia, Switzerland, Holland, and South America. In addition to the
18 responses we received to the survey directly, we talked to an additional
43 individuals involved in the virus writing culture who did not wish to
complete the surveys, but who consented to talk about their motivations
and histories. We received 3 negative (hostile) responses. Total responses:
64. The confidential survey (Appendix 1) was comprised of questions including
requests for information on social interactions with peers, relationships
with parents and other authority figures, as well as exercises in cognitive
reasoning. We were concerned primarily with the methods of thinking used
as opposed to the 'right' answers. The actual answers were not as important
as the reasons given for the answers. Other questions concerned age, employment
and educational history. Questions were asked to provide us with data regarding
the respondents relationships with parents and peers. The response to these
questions enabled us to see how the individual considers himself to 'fit
in' in both his immediate society and society in general. We also asked
questions about conflict resolution to enable us to see what processes
the individual uses to solve problems involving other people. </P>

<P>In order to illustrate reasoning abilities, the following questions
were asked: </P>

<UL>
<P>o You have four coloured plates: &lt;R&gt;ed &lt;B&gt;lue &lt;Y&gt;ellow
and &lt;G&gt;reen. Please tell me all possible color combinations. </P>

<P>o What number is 30 less than 3 times itself. When you answer this,
please write (or type) for me each step of reasoning you used to arrive
at your answer. </P>
</UL>

<P>The responses to the these types of questions provide a window into
the reasoning abilities of the individual. Reasoning abilities have been
shown to related to moral development. We asked the respondents to tell
us not only the 'answer' but to describe for us how they obtained the answer.
</P>

<P>We included the classic scenario used by Kohlberg when studying the
ethical development of individuals: </P>

<UL>
<P>o Read and consider carefully the following scenario. </P>

<P>In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There
was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of
radium that a pharmacist in the same town had recently discovered. The
drug was expensive to make, but the pharmacist was charging $2000, or 10
times the cost of the drug, for a small (possibly life-saving) dose. Heinz,
the sick woman's husband, borrowed all the money he could, about $1000,
or half of what he needed. He told the pharmacist that his wife was dying
and asked him to sell the drug cheaper, or to let him pay later. The pharmacist
replied, 'No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.'
Heinz then became desperate and broke into the store to steal the drug
for his wife. </P>

<P>Should Heinz have done that? </P>
</UL>

<P>Now that you have read it, and considered it, please resolve the moral
dilemma. That is, what are the problems in the story? What problems does
each person have to deal with? Who is wrong, right, and why? </P>

<P>When you write your response, please include the following points: </P>

<P>Should Heinz be punished for stealing the drug? Did the pharmacist have
the right to charge so much? Would it be proper to charge the pharmacist
with murder? If so, should his punishment be greater if the woman who died
was an important person? What would you have done if you were Heinz? </P>

<P>We intended the questionnaire to provide information directly as well
as indirectly, as we did not want to make too many initial assumptions.
</P>

<P>We received very detailed responses to the questions. For example, to
our question 'Which number is 30 less than 3 times itself?' we received
detailed accounts of the process by which the conclusion was derived. One
respondent stated he arrived at this answer by substituting one number
after another until one worked. Another respondent provided us with an
algebraic equation. </P>

<PRE>        'x = the number in question

                 x = 3x - 30     0 = 2x -30     -2x = -30      x = 15

        So the answer is 15.

        Proof:   15 x 3 = 45     45 - 30 = 15   15 = 15 (reflexive property
                 I think)'
</PRE>

<P>The differences in the responses illustrate the difference in the cognitive
reasoning abilities of the individuals which in turn correlate to the level
of moral development as proven by Kohlberg. According to further research
by Carol Tomlinson-Keasey and Charles Keasey and Deanna Kuhn, individuals
who demonstrate at least some formal operational skills on cognitive tests
have necessary skills for development of postconditional morality. </P>

<P>To develop the case studies, we exchanged electronic mail with some
of the respondents following collection of the survey data. These interviews
used both structured and unstructured formats. We talked with some respondents
electronically using Internet Relay Chat, and the UNIX 'talk' command.
Some of the respondents telephoned us directly. We conducted interviews
with some subjects in person. In some cases, where the identity of the
subject was totally unknown and he did not wish to be identified via mail
or talk sessions where we could netstat him, we arranged for him to login
to IRC via an anonymous host. We then talked on IRC in a private channel.
</P>

<P>These interviews provided us a more detailed insight into the life history
of the individuals who had consented to be case studies. </P>

<P><B>Virus writers </B></P>

<P>We will attempt to provide a broad classification of virus writers according
to a number of parameters. Our intention is not merely to provide an abstract
schema of how such a group might be differentiated, but to see how actual
virus writers may differ. In particular, we are interested in trying to
establish how virus writers develop and progress from early beginnings
to whatever it is they end up doing. To this end, we will examine four
cases studies conducted recently. These case studies are all of people
who have at some time written a virus. However, as will become apparent,
each of these people is very different from the others. By examining these
differences, we hope to shed some light on the notion of the 'generic'
virus writer, and to ask whether or not such a concept is valid or useful.
</P>

<P>The four initial categories we chose can be described as follows: </P>

<UL>
<P><B>o The Adolescent </B></P>

<P>Virus writer aged 13-17; has written at least one computer virus; has
distributed at least one computer virus into the wild. </P>

<P><B>o The College Student </B></P>

<P>Virus writer aged 18-24; has written at least one computer virus; has
distributed at least one computer virus into the wild. Student in university
or university level classes. </P>

<P><B>o The Adult/Professionally Employed </B></P>

<P>Post-college or adult, professionally employed; has written at least
one virus; has distributed at least one virus into the wild. </P>

<P><B>o The Ex-Virus Writer </B></P>

<P>Virus writer who has written and distributed one or more computer viruses.
The viruses must have been found in the wild; the author must have supplied
sufficient proof to enable determination that he did indeed write the virus;
there must be no evidence that he has written or continued to write viruses
for a period of at least 6 months prior to commencement of this research.
</P>
</UL>

<P>The individuals who were chosen as case studies were taken from the
selection of virus writers in their respective groups. We note that in
each group, while the ethnographic data varies, the responses to questions
related to ethical development and cognitive reasoning remained constant
between the individuals we selected and the others in their group. </P>

<P><B>The Adolescent </B></P>

<P>The case study selected is a 16 year-old unemployed male high school
student. He states he is one of three children, and lives with both parents
in what is considered an upper-middle-class home. He describes his relationships
with his friends as daily interactions. He does not express an interest
in sports. He has no formal ethical education. He states his friends are
very self-contradictory, and that they argue frequently. The arguments
appear to be of a philosophical nature; what is worthwhile, what is valid,
what is reasonable. He displays a strong conviction against racism, and
bias. He describes his friends as having no morals. He states he does not
play computer games other than a game that came with Windows. His responses
to methods of conflict resolution are unclear. His response to ethical
reasoning dilemmas fall in the range of stage 2, instrumental orientation/hedonism.
For instance, one of his responses to whether or not it was OK for Heinz
to steal the drug was 'Yes. It was for a good cause'. He states that destructive
code is unethical, and that he has never researched a virus by his own
definition of 'research'. He still writes viruses, and his viruses have
been found in the wild. When asked how he felt regarding his viruses that
have been in the wild, he responded: </P>

<UL>
<P>'Generally, I feel almost sorry for the people who are infected with
my viruses. I believe only three or four of my twenty some odd viruses
have been found in the wild. The rest were distributed via underground
bulletin board systems. </P>

<P>One of the viruses, xxxxx,xxx (named by F-Prot), was found on a CD-ROM
entitled (name deleted). I'm not exactly sure how it got there, but I know
for certain it originated on Canada Remote Systems On-line located in Toronto.
The bait file was probably uploaded to that bulletin board by a local virus
enthusiast.' </P>
</UL>

<P>Conversations with this individual indicated that he has a respect for
his parents and for authority to some degree. He demonstrates in his communications
a knowledge of what is right and what is wrong, and expresses that things
that are illegal are wrong. He indicates that he does not favour destructive
viruses, yet seems to not have any problem with his own position of having
released viruses into the wild. He is respectful to other people, and tends
to be a leader in group situations. </P>

<P>His responses and electronic communication were at all times very polite,
respectful and thoughtful. </P>

<P><B>The College Student </B></P>

<P>The case study selected is that of an 18 year-old virus writer. The
subject is unemployed and living on his own. He grew up with one sister
in a moderately well-to-do family. He enjoys martial arts and has practised
them for several years. He describes his relationships with his friends
as close, and open. He states his relationships with women are good, and
that he spends time daily with his girlfriend. His relationship with his
parents is described as very good, with the normal disagreements. Conflict
resolution on the part of this person is conciliatory and mature. He states
that he values the diversities that his friends possess. When asked about
the influence of others on his life, he responded, 'In virus writing, I
respect such authors as Dark Angel and Masud Kafir not only for their technical
programming skills, but also for the fact that their major viruses are
not destructive'. He indicates that while he recognizes using pirated software
is not right, he occasionally uses pirated software: he buys software when
he can afford it. While he used to play computer games, he claims he now
no longer has time. </P>

<P>His ethical background consists of study of Kant, Mill and Aristotle.
He states he feels he is most like Mill, in that one should be able to
have as much freedom as possible without harming another. He states he
knows he fails at this sometimes. His responses to ethical dilemma questions
were at level 4, which would place him at slightly higher than average
position according to Kohlberg's model. </P>

<P>'I feel that yes, Heinz should steal the drug as it will save his wife
(this would be my first priority) if there is no other way to get it, he
is in the wrong legally and should be punished if caught.' </P>

<P>He defines virus research as a search for truth/facts, objective series
of tests. He states some 'researchers' are actually merely collectors who
sell their viruses for profit, monetary or otherwise. Where and to whom
the viruses go is named as one ethical issue. The possibility of release,
as well as destruction/use appears as another issue. He cites money for
viruses and/or anti-viral software as a grey area. </P>

<P>He states he began writing viruses at the age of approximately 15 when
he found the Stoned virus. He became competent at assembler and has written
viruses in the past three years. He writes viruses for text publication
as well. </P>

<P><B>The Adult (1) </B></P>

<P>( (1) Adult males are typically at stage 4 and sometimes 5. The adults
surveyed/observed did not demonstrate five or six at any time of ethical
development, unlike some of Kohlberg's subjects. ) </P>

<P>The adult case study is a single male, who describes himself as living
with a ladyfriend. His income is listed in the middle-income range; he
is professionally employed. He is one of four children, and has completed
high school, with some college. He states the majority of his friends are
female. He describes his relationship with his parents as very good. His
relationships with friends are described as social interactions of a casual
nature. Conflict resolution is addressed in terms of power issues. He indicates
hypocrisy and unethical actions as stimuli for provoking him to anger.
For instance: </P>

<P>'District Attorney crusades against pornography at election time, has
bookstore operator or adult BBS operator arrested, confiscates/destroys
merchandise/money/equipment but does not pursue the case. Gets re-elected
somehow.' </P>

<P>He states his friends do not care much about morals. He states he plays
computer games perhaps 4-5 hours per week, if that much. </P>

<P>He states he does not use pirated software. The responses to cognitive
reasoning questions, and to questions regarding ethical dilemmas place
him at stage four, where obligation to law is above special interests.
He describes virus writing as a pointless exercise. It is not certain whether
he has continued to write viruses, although he has stated he does not really
enjoy programming. He stated he thought programming would get him a good
job, which it did not. This individual is involved in virus distribution,
which he states is 'not illegal'. </P>

<P><B>The Ex-virus Writer </B></P>

<P>The ex-virus writer is a college student; the only child of an upper
class family, raised in an atmosphere where academic performance was greatly
valued. He has never been formally employed, but has worked as a volunteer
at a library (shelving books), and as a volunteer at a hospital where his
job was to help handicapped/geriatric patients. He states he was active
in track, and describes his relationship with his girlfriend as good. However,
he states he did not have a girlfriend until his last year of high school,
as he was by his own definition, 'shy'. His narration of his peer relationships
and interactions closely mirror those of the teen virus writer; he states
his friends do not have morals that are very developed for the most part:
'..most of my friends have not had a reason to question the morals they
have been brought up with, so they have not fully examined their morals.
Then again, neither have I, although I am trying to do so now'. His relationship
with his parents is described as 'not good'. He described them as controlling
individuals who were performance-motivated. </P>

<P>He addresses conflict resolution logically; problems are identified,
then solved. He does not tolerate hypocrisy. Throughout our conversation,
which was conducted in person, he frequently questioned his own morals
and values. He stated that he did not 'think about it' (the morality of
releasing or writing viruses) when he was actually doing it. I asked him
specifically if his viruses were destructive. He stated 'They can't be!'.
Like the teen and college student profiled earlier, he expressed a marked
dislike for destructive code. He began writing viruses out of curiosity.
He stated he quit because he did not have any time for it. He states he
sees himself as somewhat 'obsessive', although his virus writing did not
take a lot of his time. He states he does not use copyrighted software
and does not play computer games any more (he used to play them but they
became too big to run on his computer). He defines research as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<P>'doing significant work towards meaningful results in a field. Running
scanners is not research. Compiling test results is not research. Disassembling
viruses is not research. Writing a new scanner is not research. Examining
the behaviour of viruses and their consequences is research. Developing
and implementing new techniques of detection and cleaning is research.
Classifying viruses in a reasonable fashion is not research, but it is
meaningful science.' </P>
</UL>

<P>He states he cannot say virus writing is ethical, nor can he state it
is unethical, as </P>

<UL>
<P>'there is some degree of that (lack of ethics), but I usual don't think
of it as an ethical issue. I recognize that there is a degree of irresponsibility
associated with most virus writing.' </P>
</UL>

<P>He gave the following reason for deciding to stop writing viruses: </P>

<UL>
<P>'I decided to stop primarily because I no longer have the time to write.
My productivity in writing viruses was directly proportional to my level
of boredom. I contend that my real-world impact is low. None of my viruses
are common in the wild and I have given nobody any information that they
couldn't have figured out on their own. My philosophy has always led me
to create viruses designed to be non-destructive and I don't intend for
anyone to be hassled with one of my viruses. It's a hobby, and I just don't
have time for it anymore. I've also gotten bored with viruses; they're
interesting for a while, but then there isn't much more to do with them.
I really don't know what significantly more interesting stuff there is
to do with viruses.' </P>
</UL>

<P>He made the following suggestion for stopping viruses from being written/distributed:
</P>

<UL>
<P>'Demystify them. If you want people to stop, demystify them. All that
will be left then are malicious people, and you can deal with them.' </P>
</UL>

<P>He stated he quit because he simply had too many other things to do.
He also indicated that he did not want to carry the 'stigma' of writing
viruses, and that had he realised earlier (the consequences), he would
have been smarter. His feeling was that people could be discouraged by
demystification and 'character'. He stated that responsible computing should
be taught very early. </P>

<P>He states respect for others is important. </P>

<UL>
<P>'People who cut me off on the road used to undergo a thorough drubbing:
bright lights, following, later cutting off and trapping. This was before
I realised how dangerous a game it was that I was playing.' </P>
</UL>

<P>He states he is angered by boasting that has no foundation. </P>

<UL>
<P>'Rock Steady is an example. I wrote an expose file on him and all his
code that I was considering giving out, in which I trashed all his code
and traced its origins... people should not get respect by others if they
have nothing to back it up with.' </P>
</UL>

<P>I had approximately 4.5 hours of interview with this individual in the
naturalistic setting, as well as many hours of electronic interchange and
telephone conversations. I was impressed with his genuine openness, intelligence,
and his apparent honesty and thoughtfulness. His response to the survey
was 13 pages of text, which we discussed at length. </P>

<P>Using the Kohlberg model, his ethical/moral development appears to be
at stages 4, and 5 - occasionally 6, in both thought and action. This is
slightly deviant as he is not at the age where males normally would exhibit
these levels/stages. However, his responses clearly place him there and
we have no reason to doubt them. </P>

<P>He states for instance that the best reason to observe a speed limit
is to prevent yourself from losing control of the car. His responses to
the Heinz dilemma question were: </P>

<UL>
<P>'Heinz clearly should not have stolen the drug, even though it meant
his wife's life. However, this is based upon our society assumptions of
legality and does not reflect my own moral view... The pharmacist has a
right to charge a high price, but he should be morally obligated to charge
an affordable rate... Heinz should certainly be punished for stealing the
drug. Stealing, after all, is still stealing and it is still a crime. There
can't be any 'exceptions' to the law for such cases; otherwise, what would
distinguish 'good' stealing from 'bad' stealing? And would people think
they're doing 'good' stealing and get punished? However, the sentence should
be lenient to reflect the circumstances.' </P>
</UL>

<P>What do these case studies tell us? We see that the individuals are
different in personal characteristics. We see that the adolescent and college
student are at developmental levels that would be expected for their age.
We see the ex-virus writer at the stage (or above) one would expect someone
with a mature view to have, slightly above the norm for his age. We see
the adult at an ethical/moral development stage below what Kohlberg's model
states is the norm. </P>

<P>For purposes of comparison, we solicited control subjects who never
wrote viruses. They were also different in personal characteristics, and
their ethical development according to Kohlberg's model was consistent.
However, the adult control subjects placed in the category defined by Kohlberg
as normal for their age, unlike our virus writing subject. This does not
enable us to conclude anything, but is worth further study, to see if there
is indeed any connection. At this time, all we have proven is that not
all virus writers are the same, and that some virus writers are normal
as far as ethical development goes for their ages. </P>

<P>While these individual case studies would indicate some of the individuals
had some evidence of a relatively high ethical developmental stage, this
does not tell us how they will actually act in a given situation. Ethical
judgements are normative in nature. Of course, in real life, we often make
different decisions than we do in theory. This explains why an individual
could think it is 'wrong' to write computer viruses, and yet write them
and still have ethical standards which generally appear to be normal or
above normal for their age groups. According to research done by Lawrence
Walker and his team of researchers, even when people do operate at different
levels on hypothetical/real life dilemmas, they use reasoning at adjacent
stages on the types of issues. The responses we received agree with Walker's
work. </P>

<P>Research performed by Hugh Hartshorne and Mark May provides an investigation
of the moral character of children aged 8-16 in a variety of settings.
This study also showed that the behaviour of a person in one situation
did not predict his/her willingness to conduct the same behaviour in another
situation. Later research performed by Nelson, Grinder and Mutterer and
Roger Burton found that the aspects of morality do indeed become more consistent
as age level increases. </P>

<P>What sorts of interactions and social experiences allow a person to
progress to the more mature levels of ethical development where their actions
are more conciliatory with their beliefs and values? In Kohlberg's study,
we see that transitive interactions consistently result in change. These
interactions, which are social experiences, facilitate moral growth by
introducing cognitive challenge. These social and verbal exchanges require
performance of mental operations on the reasoning abilities of ones peers.
We can observe this form of interaction in the descriptions our college
student gave concerning his interaction with his peers. We see further
evidence of this progression when we review the sort of interactions described
by the ex-virus writer. This sort of exchange is necessary for progression
to the higher levels of ethical reasoning. At a higher level of ethical
development, individuals' ethical values and actions begin to come closer
together. While some don't ever get there, most do. Some even progress
to higher stages, such as stages 5 and 6. </P>

<P>Further studies conducted by Kohlberg and his associates have shown
that the majority of non-criminals are classified in stages three and four,
while a majority of criminals are classified in stages one and two. People
who obey law to avoid punishment or who are primarily motivated by self
interest appear more likely to commit crimes than those who see the law
as beneficial to all of society. Research efforts on youth have shown that
a significant number of deviant youth were in categories one and two, while
non delinquents rank higher. </P>

<P><B>Conclusion </B></P>

<P>Based on this research, which is by no means definitive, we have observed
that virus writers are not a homogeneous group. They have characteristics
similar to many populations. They vary in age, income level, location,
social/peer interaction, educational level, likes, dislikes and manner
of communication. The ethical developmental models of the young adolescent
and college age virus writers are within the norms for the age groups of
the individuals. From the data collected, it is uncertain what predisposes
them to writing and releasing computer viruses. There is only one common
characteristic, and that is that their ethical development appears to be
within established norms. This is not the case with the adult participant
in the culture. Where adults in the control group exhibit level 3 stage
5 of ethical development, not one of the adult virus writing respondents
answered any of the questions in a way that would lead us to believe he/she
regularly functions at level 5 development. What does this mean? There
are other segments of the population that do not function at this level,
and they are not judged to be ethically 'deficient'; however, this departure
from the norm would seem to be one factor worth further consideration.
We can conclude that there is no homogeneous group to which 'The Virus
Writer' conforms. There are too many observable differences to categorize
them into a generic construct. However, we can learn from the observations.
</P>

<P>In our study, different manners of thinking were observed; different
motivations were observed. No one seemed to target government or military
as the 'subject' of their viruses. In fact, with the exception of anti-virus
product developers, there was no direct 'targeting' mentioned or implied
in any of the interactions. 'The Enemy' was virtually non-existent to the
teen and college student virus writers. 'The Enemy' to the adult respondents
consistently appeared to be 'Society'. The three ex-virus writers varied
in their perception of 'The Enemy'. One saw the enemy as society, but seemed
to feel that he could not 'win' this battle; one stated there was never
an enemy and the third stated that the enemy was 'within' the individual.
</P>

<P>Female participation in the virus writing culture appears virtually
non-existent. It is possible that female participation may increase, following
patterns similar to female involvement in other forms of youth deviant
behavioural models. </P>

<P>There are a number of social issues which are related to what is often
perceived as the isolated act of 'computer virus writing' (used here to
mean, distribution to unwilling/unknowing persons). Environmental and social
issues including abuse of substances, child abuse, education, etc., are
factors to be considered when assessing any juvenile crime or dysfunctional
behaviours. Because of this, the multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary
study of this phenomenon would appear to be the one that will yield the
most effective conclusion. </P>

<P>There are some similarities between the disfunctional behaviour of distribution
of computer viruses to unknowing/unwilling persons and forms of juvenile
delinquency. And, as with the social phenomenon of delinquency, we do not
know why some persons involved in this subculture become chronic 'career'
offenders, beginning early and continuing into adulthood. We do not know
what factors contribute to the continuation of the activity, or what factors
can contribute positively to the desistance or termination of the activity.
One theory that is often advanced is the theory of ageing out, or spontaneous
remission. In work by Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi, it is proposed
that age-crime relationships are constants: not only do chronic juvenile
offenders commit less crime as they get older, but all persons commit less
crime as they age. Therefore, age/crime correlations are irrelevant to
the study of crime. Of course, there are opposing views which purport that
the earlier a person demonstrates antisocial tendencies, the longer they
will continue to commit these acts. This sort of longitudinal theory deals
with life-cycle of delinquency/anti-social behaviour, and attempts to correlate
age/crime. Deterrence theory proposes that the choices young people make
can be controlled by threat of punishment: the more severe, certain and
swift the punishment, the more the deterrence value. Proponents of such
theory support laws to impose severe penalties on virus writers. However,
it is not certain that such strategies work, and in fact they may be counterproductive.
According to research published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology,
'Little reason exists to believe that crime and delinquency can be eliminated
merely by the fear of legal punishment alone. More evidence exists that
fear of social disapproval and informal penalties, criticisms, and punishments
from parents and friends may actually be a greater deterrent to crime than
legal punishments'. Sociologist Jack Katz feels the seduction of crime
is a prime motivation for anti-social acts. Research conducted in Toronto,
Canada by John Hagan and Bill McCarthy supports this theory, which places
at least part of the cause for this behaviour on situational inducements.
Cultural deviance theory maintains that certain actions are performed because
the individuals adhere to the value system within their own subculture.
We can consider dealing with the persons who distribute viruses maliciously
in the same ways as we deal with others who do what we perceive to be malicious
acts. This includes clarifying our own positions on what constitutes malicious
action; constraint, degree, intent, knowledge, 'bad tendency' and clear
and present danger. </P>
