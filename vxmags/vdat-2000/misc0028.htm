<p><i>The Melissa computer virus was dropped into the alt.sex newsgroup early 
  in the morning on March 26. It spread faster than any previous virus, fortunately 
  causing no permanent damage, but temporarily shutting down many companies' email 
  servers. Almost a week later authorities, with the help of AOL, traced the dropping 
  of the virus to David L. Smith's phone line. His arrest came minutes after another 
  man -- a software company president by day, cybersleuth by night, named Richard 
  M. Smith (no relation) -- had tracked down David L. Smith using the Internet. 
  Here, this digital-age Philip Marlowe tells his hard-boiled story. </i></p>
<p>It was a Friday, about six o'clock in the evening, late March, darkness falling. 
  Brittle, brown twigs with neat, green buds giving it another go, swayed in the 
  cold, hard wind in front of my third-floor window. In a few months the leaves 
  would obscure my view of Boston, the city my mail told me I lived in. Cars hummed 
  in the distance, driven, no doubt, by lonely drivers with flasks pursed to their 
  lips on their way to happy hours in search of women and a warm place to sleep 
  for the night. It was a raw deal, but at least they were offline. Wearing blue 
  Dockers, a checked-blue Gap shirt and thin, wool, Brooks Brothers socks, I carried 
  a clean IBM Thinkpad with a blue-tinted screen. I was everything a private cybersleuth 
  ought to be. I should have been with the wife at some high school play, one 
  of those <i>Our Town</i> jobs slapped together by a teacher who still cared. 
  Instead, I was knee-deep in the alt.comp.virus newsgroup. In it were hackers, 
  anti-virus patrolmen, virtual private eyes sniffing around for a job and teen 
  geeks with brains almost as big as their zits, but no more common sense than 
  a wet puppy. It was the kind of joint where you couldn't always separate the 
  bad guys from the good. J. Merritt's email stood out like a ham and cheese sandwich 
  at a Passover seder.<font face="verdana, arial, geneva, sans serif"> </font></p>

    bombed with the email virus Melissa today. Says "Here's that document you 
    asked for... don't show anyone else ;)." You open her attached word document 
    "list.doc," and she replicates herself to the first 50 people in your address 
    book using Microsoft Outlook. As far as I can tell, she's solely located on 
    the IU campuses in Bloomington and Indianapolis.</font> </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p> An academic. Well, an academic from the state of Indiana, but, he seemed like 
  a right guy, and I needed the work. Besides, I had my own ax to grind. You see, 
  Microsoft Office 97 documents contain a little something in their source code 
  called a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID). A couple months earlier, I had discovered 
  if you have an Ethernet card, your individual Ethernet address shows up in the 
  GUID. Translation: an electronic fingerprint. Email a Word attachment, and it 
  can be traced back to you. It is a privacy issue, plain and simple, but none 
  of the single-minded privacy wonks had really listened to me. They had thicker 
  blinders than a racehorse with ADD, and all they wanted was to get Intel for 
  putting serial numbers in Pentium 3. Intel wasn't my business. This was. 
<p> I shot J. Merritt a reply. "Are there any GUIDs or names in the source code 
  of 'List.doc' messages?" 
<p> He replied, obedient as a Siegfried and Roy tiger. "Here are the GUIDs from 
  three different email attachments of the message people here received." 
<p> The Ethernet addresses in the GUIDs were identical, like twins cruelly dressed 
  in matching red overalls and child leashes. 
<p> "Better send me Melissa," I replied, short, sweet and simple. "And make sure 
  she's wrapped." 
<p><b>Chapter Two </b> 
<p> It was Saturday morning when I ducked out of the www.rain.com and into www.dejanews.com. 
  It was a wide, clean site with a banner ad for a long distance phone outfit 
  running across the top. No Dennis Miller, no George Carlin, not even a Tony 
  Danza hocking the poor service; just some old geezer with sad eyes and a tight 
  mouth. Still, five cents a minute isn't anything to sneeze at, and it wasn't 
  pretty to figure the ad was clicked on about as much as the Lifetime Channel 
  in a frat-house rec room. Nobody had to remind me -- the only job in cyberspace 
  lonelier than a virtual sleuth is an e-commerce salesman. 
<p> Dejanews.com keeps a record of all the newsgroup messages anyone ever sends. 
  Anywhere. Any newsgroup. It knows your past. If you have one. Melissa had one. 
  I typed "Melissa" and "virus" into dejanews' search engine and waded through 
  the sticky muck. A little girl's guinea pig named Melissa with a virus. A coed 
  named Melissa with a ten-page paper on stomach viruses due in three hours. Another 
  dame named Melissa wanting to know if the plural of virus is virii. It was sad 
  stuff, the kind of stuff that can keep a man up at night pondering the meaning 
  of this godforsaken World Wide Web. I pulled a bottle of Ch&acirc;teau St. Jean 
  merlot out of a deep drawer. It was a little number I had picked up at the Sonoma 
  County Reserve. I sniffed the cork, poured myself a glass, took a sip and plodded 
  on. 
<p> Twenty long minutes later and eight long sips down the hatch, I hit bull's 
  eye. Dr. Solomon's Virus Patrol, an anti-virus peddler with more arrogance than 
  a firefighter blowing out a match, had the rap on Melissa. She had dropped early 
  Friday morning from the account skyroket@aol.com. The doctor wrote, "Warning! 
  A virus has been found in a binary file posted to the following newsgroups(s): 
  alt.sex." I shot skyroket@aol.com an email and, not expecting anything there, 
  followed the doctor's lead. 
<p> It takes moxie to call alt.sex a newsgroup. There isn't much news going on. 
  There is plenty of everything else. For a price, you can have anything you want, 
  and I wanted none of it. Live sex video feeds, audio orgasm streams, flash porno 
  animations, dames and fellas, mostly underage, with every sick fetish known 
  to man. I kept my cool and my mouse to myself. I spotted the message from skyroket@aol.com, 
  and that's when my inbox quacked. 
<p><b>Chapter Three </b> 
<p> Miss Melissa was poised in the top position of my Eudora email inbox, beckoning. 
  She was urgent, personal and in bold-type face. She had a nice, long, smooth 
  subject heading, and she made sure I saw it. She had the weary, hard look of 
  a topless dancer who'd slithered around too many poles. But her giggle, the 
  giggle of a school child with an extra fruit roll-up in her reusable lunch bag, 
  said she'd found new life in the computer virus racket. Still, there was something 
  about her that was too frisky, too needy, like one of those digital Tamagotchi 
  pets on the shelf of a Toys "R" Us, three days after Christmas. She giggled 
  again. And then she purred, "I'm an important message from your friend J. Merritt. 
  How 'bout a drink?" I poured us both a glass of merlot, knowing just what to 
  expect. 
<p> Yeah, I could see how a bird could get dizzy with this dame. But, to me, she 
  was just a dope. I gave her a ;). "Sugar, the game's up. J. Merritt sent me 
  to you wrapped in a zip file. You can't infect me. You've had your fun, and 
  so now let's be nice." I knew it was probably a stolen account, a piss-poor 
  attempt at creating a patsy, but I asked anyway. "Who's skyroket@aol.com? Who's 
  your daddy?" 
<p> "Go ______ yourself," she stammered and shook her glass at me. Merlot running 
  down my face, I grabbed my binary dump program and dumped her attachment into 
  a hex file. The hex file would let me poke around. The attachment listed every 
  sleazy porn site from www.creamythighs.com to www.cyberstrip.com and passwords, 
  all probably bunk. Could be spam sent out by an adult site racket, but I doubted 
  it. Miss Melissa didn't seem the type. Tears welled up in her eyes. She cried, 
  and under her hot, tense breath, murmured, "Go ______ yourself" and collapsed 
  into my arms. 
<p> I could see her code now, and it wasn't pretty. She was a mess. Sloppier than 
  a sloppy joe. Then I spotted them. The GUID and an author name. John Holmes. 
  I let myself chuckle. The late porn star, a.k.a. Johnny Wadd. Same stiff they 
  based Dirk Diggler on. Thirteen inches, they said. Died of the AIDS virus in 
  the Eighties. Whoever wrote Melissa thought he had a sense of humor. And he 
  was probably an older egg. I looked up skyroket@aol.com on dejanews. This guy 
  had dropped viruses before. AOL hadn't done anything. Yep, this was starting 
  to get interesting. It was time to pay another visit to alt.comp.virus and dangle 
  the bait. I shot the newsgroup an email of everything I knew. This wasn't going 
  to be fun. I slept that night like a baby really does. 
<p><b>Chapter Four </b> 
<p>He said his name was Mr. <a href="groups1.htm#CB">Lord Natas</a>. Satan spelled 
  backward. He was paying me a Sunday-morning visit in my inbox. Just another 
  virus writer trying to scare me off the case. Cute. He cut to the chase. "So, 
  another stalker? It is always a sad thing to see when people have absolutely 
  nothing to do with their time. And people ask me why I use anonymous remailers." 
  Not so cute. He included quotes from Nietzsche and one from Charles Manson, 
  favorites of lost adolescent souls who are anything but virtual. I could have 
  tracked down his email address, shot him a message that crashed his machine. 
  I left it alone. I looked at my reflection in the window. I'm in my mid-forties, 
  my face widening and crinkling at the same time, small, faint brown spots finding 
  a permanent address on my upper cheeks. My salt-and-pepper beard needed a trim, 
  but the barbers weren't playing that game anymore. Too much blood. Too many 
  nicks. One very real virus. I glanced to my right at my daughter on her computer. 
  She emailed freely and sweetly to her pals about boys and math assignments. 
  Her inbox; that was why this was all worth it. 
<p><b>Chapter Five </b> 
<p> It was six o'clock Sunday night when Fredrik Bj&ouml;rck -- a young, bright-eyed 
  Swede with a techie-sounding job and too few c's and too many j's in his name 
  -- appeared in my inbox, a wide-eyed :) in his subject header. This was all 
  fun and games for Fredrik, but I had a hunch he could help. He had found skyroket@aol.com's 
  homepage. It had more virus-making tool kits spread out across the site than 
  copies of Ally Sheedy's poetry book in a Barnes and Noble bargain bin. Everything 
  any kid who was made fun of at school needed to wreak havoc. All the tool kits 
  had the mark of one bird, VicodinES. 
<p> Fredrik gave me the skinny. "VicodinES is a well-known Macro virus maker that 
  is now said to be retired. But, VicodinES is not really retired. They never 
  are." And there it was, plain as an Arthur Andersen consultant. "VicodinES takes 
  credit for creating a Word2000 Macro virus kit," Fredrik beamed. "And it does 
  the similar things to Melissa. Any ideas?" I checked the GUID of the Word2000 
  macro virus kit. It matched Melissa. 
<p> One of the virus kits linked to www.sourceofkaos.com, a cold, proud, umbrella 
  site, out in the open and reachable by any old Yahoo! It was home to more than 
  30 of the filthiest virus writers. (A news hawk at <i>The New York Times</i> 
  would later track www.sourceofkaos to a home in Orlando where a scared mother 
  would tell him the leader of the racket was at school.) It didn't take long 
  to find VicodinES's site. There were more virus tool kits than before. I downloaded 
  the kits. I dumped them into hex files. Same GUIDs -- or so I thought -- and 
  more names in the source code. J.P. Morgan, Ben Dover and Dr. Diet Mountain 
  Dew. I definitely had a bad comedian on my hands. I made a mental note to find 
  out how much Pauly Shore knew about computers and moved on. Bingo. Mr. VicodinES 
  had been sloppy. He didn't always change the author names. Two stood out, repeating 
  over and over again like a broken CD-ROM. "David L. Smith" and "Gerald Vernesky." 
  I'd bet my Thinkpad one of them was our man. 
<p> Finding the right David L. Smith would be like finding a needle in Keith Richards' 
  dressing room. I decided to start with Gerald Vernesky. It was back to dejanews 
  for another favor. I typed the letters in V-E-R-N-E-S-K-Y slowly, my fingers 
  following each key carefully down into its groove. I pressed "search" and waited. 
  I pulled a bottle of '98 Kistler, a Chianti, out of a deep drawer. I sniffed 
  the cork. Something was wrong. I had bought the bottle at an online auction. 
  It had been a steal. Too much of a steal. I picked up the slender bottle, walked 
  downstairs to the kitchen and poured the Chianti into the sink. I grabbed a 
  Klondike bar from the freezer and headed back up. His messages were waiting 
  for me. Gerald Vernesky had posted two messages in the past two years in alt.comp.virus. 
  It was time to call the feds.
<p><b>Chapter Six </b> 
<p> Monday, skyroket@aol.com replied to my email. "Sorry, I am not the creator 
  of the virus, nor did I have any part in the distribution of the virus. Sincerely, 
  Scott Steinmetz." I believed him. His account must have been stolen. He was 
  probably being swamped with nasty emails from birds who had run out of pals 
  to email from work. I had nothing else to do. I felt bad for him. The calm before 
  the newspaper story. 
<p> Tuesday, the <i>Times</i> ran the story. No mention of Gerald Vernesky or 
  David L. Smith. Plenty of inches on me. Plus my photo. It'd be good for business. 
  Which meant it'd be a headache. The trade journals called first. The dailies, 
  a little later. One news hawk from a local rag wanted to know, "Is the search 
  for the Melissa virus running into some hurdles?" I wanted to know if his brain 
  had been surgically removed as a baby. But, I kept my cool. I had to. The local 
  news vans were parked outside, calling in from their cellulars, emailing from 
  their laptops. This was no time to shun the news hawks. Most of them had less 
  to tell me than Ronald Reagan trying to compose his memoirs, but, maybe one 
  of them had something. 
<p> Wednesday, my phone kept ringing. It was too early for a Klondike bar. I had 
  one anyway. I dripped ice cream on my keyboard. I said, "Shit," and logged on. 
  The feds had taken down the www.sourceofkaos.com server. I said, "Shit," again. 
  The phone kept ringing. I picked up the receiver. Chris Taylor was a hard-nosed, 
  all-business Brit, working stateside, covering technology for <i>Time</i> magazine. 
  He kept his nose close to the screen and his ear to the RealAudio player. He'd 
  been spoon-feeding readers who couldn't program a clock on a VCR for some time. 
  He knew to check the obvious. He had done a search for VicodinES on dejanews. 
  He had the rap on every time VicodinES had sent a message, and he was ready 
  to talk. VicodinES had spent some time in the rec.music.industrial newsgroup. 
  One message from 1995 stood out like a World Series ring on a Boston Red Sox 
  player. "There's a promo party for Cleopatra's Enchantments this Monday at Nemesis 
  in Ft. Lauderdale. We will be giving away promo CDs, tapes and postcards -- 
  VicodinES@aol.com. Peace, Vic." Ft. Lauderdale. We weren't in cyberspace anymore. 
<p><b>Chapter Seven </b></p>
<p> I was closing in on Gerald Vernesky when Rishi Khan appeared in my inbox Wednesday 
  night. Subject heading: "Cohorts in the Melissa Virus Ordeal." Rishi was an 
  undergrad, University of Delaware, with an Indian mom, Italian pops. Dinner 
  at his home must have been interesting. Computer engineering was Rishi's racket, 
  and he had a brain the size of an African elephant. "Here's some digging I've 
  done. I doubt all the ingenuity of the virus came from one person." He had found 
  some other VicodinES tool kits. They had different Ethernet addresses. Could 
  be more than one person. Could be one person with two Ethernet addresses. I 
  wasn't ready to commit, but Rishi had more, and he wasn't holding back. Subject 
  heading: "Hate to say this but..." Half the tool kits I had downloaded on VicodinES's 
  Web site actually had been created by a bird going by ALT-F11. I had been sloppy 
  before, I hadn't noticed. There was more. All 32 numbers of the GUID on a virus 
  by ALT-F11 called Shiver, matched the Melissa GUID. There was more. Miss Shiver 
  contained an attachment with the same list of porno sites. Rishi didn't mince 
  words. "The only fingerprint that was found DOESN'T point to VicodinES...it 
  points to ALT-F11." It was April Fool's Day, and it looked like I played the 
  part well. 
<p> I stayed up all night. A Klondike bar in one hand, glass of '98 Duckhorn merlot 
  in the other. Rishi was smart, smarter, maybe, than I was, but he was young. 
  Then again, was I too old? I stared out the window, the Prudential Building 
  and the John Hancock taking the place of stars. When you wish upon a building.... 
  I couldn't make heads or tails out of the case, but I knew one thing. A dead 
  end for Rishi was a dead end. For me, it was a place to start. I decided to 
  pay Miss Shiver a visit. 
<p><b>Chapter Eight </b></p>
<p> Shiver was an older virus, and she craved more attention than a junior high 
  school principal at an all-student assembly. She knew why I had come. She knew 
  I was going to come. She knew she was going to let me in. "Go ahead and dump 
  me into a hex file, big fella," she purred. "Maybe, you'll be a good boy and 
  tell your friends at <i>The New York Times</i> about me." I was silent. I pulled 
  out my binary dump file, and dumped her in a hex file. Her code was clean, indented 
  and readable. She was the kind of code you could take home to your computer 
  professor. "Tell me about Melissa, sugar," I demanded. She sulked, her age showing 
  as salty tears got caught in the wrinkles of her typeface. 
<p> "So, you're just here about Melissa. What about me?" 
<p> "You knew I wasn't interested in you, baby. Now, spill it." 
<p> "OK, I was created by ALT-F11. Melissa stole my attachment of the porno sites. 
  She was created by VicodinES, that sloppy, son of a---" 
<p> <b>Chapter Nine </b>
<p>She passed out in my hex file. I took a snoop around. Miss Shiver was right. 
  The GUIDs on her and Melissa matched, but the virus programming codes were as 
  a far apart as a Mormon from Dennis Rodman. Melissa was sloppy and had VicodinES' 
  fingerprints all over her. It had been revised at 6:45 a.m. It had dropped from 
  skyroket@aol.com a half-hour later. That told me three things. One: VicodinES 
  had dropped Melissa. Two: To be dropped at such an early hour meant VicodinES 
  probably lived on the East Coast. Three: VicodinES must have lifted the list.doc 
  of porn sites from Shiver, changed the date at the top of the list and attached 
  to Melissa. The only question remained: Who is VicodinES? 
<p>It was Friday morning, around 8 o'clock, the loud honk of a beat-up Chevy calling 
  on the teenager who lived down the street. For all I knew, he could have been 
  VicodinES. The kid down the street. Cyberspace. It brings us together, they 
  say, but I could go all the way around the globe just to get to the kid down 
  the street. I was still leaning hard toward Gerald Vernesky, but I had another 
  hunch. I took another look at a tool kit I had breezed by. Vernesky was there. 
  So was John Holmes, J.P. Morgan and Dr. Diet Mountain Dew. Nothing new there. 
  But, one name kept appearing. David L. Smith. David L. Smith. David L. Smith. 
  It had to be him. I sat there for 15 minutes. It was time to make my move. The 
  phone rang. It was my pal at <i>The New York Times</i>. "The New Jersey police 
  have arrested a guy. His name is David L. Smith." </p>
<p><b>Epilogue </b></p>
<p>It's two weeks after Melissa dropped. She's still appearing in people's inboxes, 
  her subject heading, once so enticing, now just a pathetic reminder of what 
  she once was and how easily we believed. The antivirus companies have her under 
  wraps. A simple download. David L. Smith is out on bail, somewhere, as Bruce 
  Springsteen might say, in the swamps of Jersey. The New Jersey police had nabbed 
  Smith the old way: tracing phone lines. AOL had traced skyroket@aol.com's dropping 
  of Melissa to an ISP in Monmouth, New Jersey. The phone number had left caller 
  ID on. They had a phone number. They had a name. The name confessed. My work 
  didn't solve the case. I was used to that. New Jersey says David L. Smith isn't 
  VicodinES. My hunch says he is. The two names have appeared together more times 
  than Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. But, is Gerald Vernesky another alias for David 
  L. Smith? Or is he ALT-F11? When will ALT-F11 strike? And when he does, who 
  will get hurt? My daughter's at her computer right now. Her email box just quacked. 
  I think she's safe... for now. </p>
