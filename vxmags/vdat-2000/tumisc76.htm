<P>
 This tutorial isn't to discuss about any polymorphism matters, or to
 just explain you it's basics. It's fully oriented for you to at last
 *learn* how to write a polymorphic engine, with useful tips on how to
 implement it.
</P>
<p>Some coders, even some really good ones, feel it so difficult when it's time 
  to come into polymorphism. "Ok, I have to swap instructions, but how the hell 
  do I make that, how do I control the decryptor length and that the decrypting 
  instructions are on their place ?" and so on. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="1"></a>WHAT IS A POLYMORPHIC ENGINE</font></b> 
</p>
<P>
 We start from the very beggining. What is polymorphism ? The abitily
 from a virus to change it's shape each time it infects a file. As you know,
 even if your virus is encrypted, the bytes from the routine that decrypts
 the main body will still remain static, so the AV can detect you easily.
 So, the main idea about polymorphism is changing that static shape so AV
 have to change their way to detect your virus.
</P><P>
 I'll suppose you have some knowledge on virus/asm, so let's go:
</P>
<P> <b><font size="+1"><a name="2"></a>HOW DO I MAKE IT ?</font></b></P>
<P> <b><a name="2A"></a>+ PHASE 1: BUILDING THE DECRYPTOR INSTRUCTIONS </b></P>
<P>
 After reading this, you should be able at least to make an "oligomorphic"
 engine, which is better than no polymorphism at all: oligomorphism is some
 kind of despective word used with polymorphic not-very-polymorphic
 viruses.
</P><P>
 Your virus is this:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
    .-----------------.
    |                 |&lt;-- Virus decryptor
    |-----------------|
    |                 |&lt;-- Virus body ( encrypted )
    '-----------------'
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Let's imagine you use simple XOR encryption. Then your decryptor would look
 as this:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
        call delta
delta:  pop bp
        call decrypt
        [...]                   ; encrypted code
decrypt:
        mov dl,byte ptr ds:[encryption_key+bp]
        lea si,encryptinit+bp
        mov cx,encryptend-encryptinit
loop_on_decryption:
        mov al,byte ptr ds:[si]
        xor al,dl
        mov byte ptr ds:[si],al
        inc si
        loop loop_on_decryption
        ret
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 You will notice that this decryptor is very unoptimized, and that thing
 would be so bad for permutating instructions as it's easier to get fixed
 bytes this way. We can calculate the delta offset before infecting even
 in win32 - by looking at the base address -, and make this a bit smaller:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
        mov bp,XXXX
newdelta equ $-2        ; So you just have to place new delta there
        lea si,bp+encryptinit
        mov cx,encryptend-encryptinit
decr_loop:
        xor byte ptr ds:[si],XX
        inc si
encrvalue equ $-1       ; Again you place it in the decryptor
        loop decr_loop
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Now we have just five instructions. A lot better, no ? We can even optimize
 itmore by just eliminatin the "mov bp,XXXX", and precalculate bp+cryptbegin
 loading it to si, loading the delta offset inside the encrypted code:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
        mov si,XXXX                             ; 3 bytes
        mov cx,cryptend-cryptbegin              ; 3 bytes
decr_loop:
        xor byte ptr ds:[si],XX                 ; 3 bytes
        inc si                                  ; 1 byte
        loop decr_loop                          ; 2 bytes
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 Wow, just we have five instructions to make a decryptor, not just that
 but look at their length: we can easily divide them in four blocks of
 three instructions, as all the blocks have same length !. Of course inc
 si and loop decr_loop can be in the same block, as really it is as if
 they were one, the two are needed there.
</P><P>
 Then, just remember you have to keep the original instructions anywhere
 if you change them, or generate them independant from what was generated
 earlier.
</P><P>
 Now let's see what can we permutate. Look at the two first instructions.
 Does anything matter if we change their place ? Not really, they aren't
 dependant on each other, so their position can be changed. Your engine
 could do that easily.
</P><P>
 We go to the XOR. More fixed bytes, but who said you can only encrypt
 with XOR ? You can change that XOR for an ADD in example, making SUB when
 encrypting. You should make a NOT, ROR, etc:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       xor byte ptr [si],XX                  80h 34h XXh
       add byte ptr [si],XX                  80h 04h XXh
       sub byte ptr [si],XX                  80h 2ch XXh
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 So, just changing the second opcode we can permutate among different
 encryption schemes. But again who said that SI has to be the pointer ? Here
 we have another change we could make. Look at this:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
       xor byte ptr [di],XX                  80h 35h XXh
       xor byte ptr [bx],XX                  80h 37h XXh
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 You just have to change also the SI loading to play with a lot of
 registers (and the inc si, of course). Also Intel cared about us virus
 writers, and when using 32bit access you can use any register as a
 pointer, which gives you much more possibilities.
</P><P>
 It's easy to imagine other permutations even in this little bunch of
 code. You could load in SI or whatever not the encryption start but the
 end and change the INC SI for a DEC SI. You could change the LOOP for
 a DEC REGISTER/JNZ and then change the CX register for another one. No
 limits for your imagination.
</P><P>
 So what ? Let's say you want to implement this. It doesn't seem
 difficult, as you should just use random numbers to decide whether to do
 or not one change. To make it easier, I recommend:
</P>
<ul>
  <li> Remember to make a copy of the original instructions, or don't depend on 
    that data when generating new ones for another infection. If you change the 
    place where ESI is loaded with the delta shit, you wouldn't probably find 
    it again. Take a buffer to mess up the instructions and change them, and each 
    time you are going to infect replace them, in example. </li>
  <li>Try to do an infector that just uses this kind of oligomorphism/ polymorphism. 
    When it's done, it will be time for more serious issues. </li>
</ul>
<P> <b><a name="2B"></a>+ PHASE 2: BUILDING AN OPCODE GENERATOR </b></P>
<P>
 The polymorphic method before is a bit unnefective: you could eliminate
 some or all fixed bytes, but that's not enough. Also, any person with a
 middle knowledge in viruses that looks at that code will notice that it's
 a virus, and that he is watching a decryptor.
</P><P>
 So you have to make garbage among the instructions. Which of these sounds
 better for you ?
</P><P>
 Without garbage:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
  mov esi,405355h
  mov ecx,85Ch
  xor byte ptr ds:[esi],12h
  [...]
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 With garbage:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
  mov dx,0ffffh
  mov ax,bx
  add ax,121Dh
  &gt; mov di,4355h
  div di
  inc dx
  jnz 1211h
  &gt; mov cx,85Ch
  [...]
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 The second style may look as if it was a legitimate program. Of course
 there are some points that have to be fixed, but this is the way to get
 it. As I surely conviced you on the neccesity of a decryptor, here is the
 main objective of this section, building the opcode generator.
</P><P>
 First of all, you'll wonder how to build all that garbage. I recommend
 you making by yourself a list of opcodes in instructions. Then, you have
 to classify them. You can do it in example by the number of bytes, or
 by looking at if they need random values. To accomplish this just take
 debug or a good source as the Intel Developers Insight.
</P><P>
 Let's think on the second one. Let's say we have the opcodes for a list of
 instructions which are based on 1 opcode plus a 2 byte value. This can be
 mov reg,imm16 in example. So, when you call the routine that generates
 that kind of instructions, the opcode for the desired instruction plus the
 random value would be selected.
</P><P>
 For this code it's supposed you've made a getrndnumber function which
 returns a number smaller than the parameter AX: you can easily achive this
 by dividing the random number by AX and storing the remainder which will
 be lesser than AX.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
generate12:
  mov AX,7h                                 ; Seven registers
  call getrndnumber
  lea si, registertable
  add si,ax
  lodsb                                     ; We have the desired opcode
  stosb                     ; We suppose di points to the decryptor

  mov ax,0ffffh
  call getrndnumber
  stosw                     ; Now we store a two bit random number

registertable:
  db   0b8h,0bbh,0b9h,0bah,0bdh,0beh,0bfh   ; MOV reg,imm16
    ;   AX   BX   CX   DX   BP   SI   DI
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 It's not this simple as you have to check if your decryptor uses one of
 this registers, but I think you'll get the idea. A good way to avoid
 overwriting useful registers can be keeping a byte which bits indicate
 if one register is used or not in this part of the decryptor, or in the
 whole decryptor if you don't want to make things more complicated.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
    AX BX CX DX BP SI DI
   .--------------------.
   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
   '--------------------'
     0  0  1  0  0  1  0
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 So, a 1 will tell us that it's used, a 0 that you can operate with it
 without messing the decryption: imagine the bad stuff that would be
 making a /mov si,startencr/add ax,1200h/xor si,1100h :)
</P><P>
 Getting deeper in this into advanced polymorphism, you shouldn't just
 store the opcodes of the instruction, as you're wasting lots of space. I
 recommend you Lord Julus's guide, where you can get a deeper view on this.
 I just remind you that you should watch out how redirection modes go when
 operating with registers: any r/m instruction's second byte is called the
 'ModR/M' byte. There, the instruction stores the redirection mode: first
 two bits get in four groups, and the next three bit fields indicate which
 register is used; when one of the operands of the instruction is a
 register, it's AX = 000, CX = 001, DX = 010 and so on
</P><P>
 Now you more or less know how to build garbage. You can use lots of
 routines as the one I wrote calling them randomly and create a shitload of
 garbage there. GenX represents one kind of garbage:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
                                  Start

    |     '--------------------------.
    |                                |
    |                      .-------------------.
    '----------------------| Check if finished |
            No             '-------------------'
                                     | Yes
                                  .-----.
                                  | end |
                                  '-----'
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 BTW,this isn't finished, and we are getting to the part some coders fear.
 Making things finally work.
</P>
<P> <b><a name="2C"></a>+ PHASE 3: GARBAGE + DECRYPTOR: FINISH THE ENGINE </b></P>
<P>
 Maybe another difficult thing is mixing the garbage generator and the
 decryptor. In this part, I've preferred to list some problems and give
 you some advice on how to solve them:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> a) How do I call a "generate decryption instruction" </p>
  <p> As well as you call any "generate garbage" one. The best way you can do 
    this is by making generation in two phases: you generate X bytes of garbage 
    and then one instruction, and so on until you reach the end. You should then 
    make for example 30-50 bytes of garbage + 3 bytes of instruction + 30-50 bytes, 
    etc, until you reach the end. </p>
  <p> And remember to put some garbage after the last instruction and before the 
    first one !. Another good thing could be changing the entry point randomly 
    also. </p>
  <p> b) Calculate the final loop </p>
  <p> Either if you choose a loop for decryption or a conditional jump, you should 
    calculate the distance between that and the xor/add/sub/etc instruction as 
    it's a relative jump. Of course that's easy for any coder - remember it's 
    stored in two complement -, but you should keep in mind it's a short jump 
    in DOS, so you can't place them too far from each other. Fortunately, since 
    486 you can make long jump structures, with 16bit or 32bit relative jumps 
    as there are alternative conditional jump instructions. Coolio for your win32 
    virus polymorphic engine. </p>
  <p> c) What if I want stealth so I need a fixed length generator ? </p>
  <p> This is also very simple. You can make the generation variable in length, 
    but correct it in the next call to garbage generation, fixing the bytes to 
    the one you desire. </p>
</blockquote>
<P>
 So, this is the end. Following my advice you shouldn't find it difficult
 getting into one of the most personal and powerful parts in a virus,
 polymorphism.
</P>
<P> <b><a name="2D"></a>+ PHASE 4: USEFUL TIPS </b></P>
<P>
 - Try to use undocumented opcodes. Some info can be found in www.x86.org.
 Opcodes as 0f1h - or int1h/ICEBP, maybe 0d6h - SALC - should be used to
 kill code emulators which want to trace your code: bad stuff is it won't
 work with AMD or Cirix processors as they are undocumented.
</P><P>
 - Avoid stupid looking stuff. That would be modifying a register and then
 loading any value on it without saving the last one in example. You can
 look which registers are touched when you generate them or by looking at
 the MODR/M byte of the instruction. You shouldn't have anything like this:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
    * XOR AX,AX
    * MOV AX,0CCCCh
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 - If you want to make reentrant calls, one simple method is generating also
 inconditional jumps this way:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
    jmp Next
      &lt;garbage&gt;
      ret
Next:
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<P>
 You can fill the garbage place then finish with a ret. Recursive calls to
 the polymorphic engine would be a good way to do that. So, as you have
 the beggining of the garbage, you can call it when you want.
</P><P>
 - Don't place interrupts/long time wasting instructions inside the loop.
 Illustrating this is very simple: imagine you used some service from the
 int 21h, and you encrypted the code in a byte step. If there were four
 of this interrupts inside the loop and the virus is 2Kb long in example,
 you would execute 2048x4 = 8192 int 21h calls. But sure in most modern
 computers wasting a lot isn't really important.
</P><P>
 - When writing a polymorphic engine for win32, one trick you can do is
 saving some data in the data section of the PE in your virus so you can
 write in the old one, giving your decryptor memory direct writing
 capability.
