<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHO ARE YOU, WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE VX SCENE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I go under the nick QuantumG, previously Quantum of <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
and I do absolutely nothing in the vx scene except possibly lurking on
irc and annoying people who actually DO do something.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT MADE YOU ENTER THE VIRUS SCENE? HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN A VIRUS CODER?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Metabolis and Qark befriended me (what can I say, they have good taste)
and saw that they could twist my somewhat unproductive graphics coding
skills to virus coding. After I learnt the basics Qark started to teach
me some more complex stuff like TSR, COM/EXE and that was generally my
ticket into VLAD. My first virus, named Tashya Yar, was remotely impressive
as it was my first Full Stealth virus (disinfect on open re-infect on close)
but it started the long honoured tradition of not being tested nearly enough
and thus having major bugs - which lead to Tashya Yar mark II, which appeared
in VLAD#4 my first VLAD release. I've been a virus coder since about the
release of VLAD#3, you figure it out.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOUR INTERESTS IN VIRUSES?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Anything experimental will get me interested. New platforms and multi-platform
stuff generally and although I've never coded a polymorphic engine, I'm
slightly interested in that.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS
IN THE SCENE WERE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I dont know, consistently producing buggy code? Heh, I'd have to say
the world's first win95 virus (the betas worked!) and the media scare it
produced. Although I've received a lot of flack over that, we're still
awaiting a TSR win95 virus (this issue?).</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">SAME QUESTION, BUT FOR VLAD</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>same answer but for VLAD.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT'S YOUR GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE VX SCENE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>err.. we all start out excited at the prospects, we code till we stop,
we try new and exciting ideas, we run out of ideas, we lurk around on irc
search for something to do, we become warez pups, we become pr0n kiddies,
we become hackers, we become burnt out hackers, we become halflife.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">SAME QUESTION, BUT AV INSTEAD.</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I wouldn't have a clue. They begin hating us, they discover we're ok
and try to be our friends, we dis them endlessly, and all the while they
keep misinforming the media and raking in the cash.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHO DO YOU RESPECT MOST IN THE VX SCENE? (CODERS,
GROUPS, ZINES)</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It's hard to say cause I'm so disconnected from the scene myself. I
can generalize that I respect anyone that can just keep on coming up with
new stuff and not get bored of it all. Some of the most fantastic, although
utterly useless for any other purpose, stuff has come out of virus coders
- you have to know your stuff and that's something worth respecting.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">SAME BUT DISRESPECT</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>err.. halflife.. nah.. just kiddin'.. I dont hate anyone in the vx scene
really except possibly the irc warriors.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">SAME TWO QUESTIONS AGAIN BUT AV INSTEAD.</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>respect: the small companies that do all the work and dont fuck the
user around<BR>
disrespect: bonchev<BR>
undecided: Sarah Gordon, she spreads my name but seeing I've never read
what she writes about me I have no idea whether she is friend or foe.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">FAVOURITE VIRUSES AND WHY?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I dont collect or even look at viruses so I wouldn't have a clue.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">FAVOURITE AV PROG'S AND WHY?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>AVP appears to be the best of late, TBAV is a close second and I havnt
looked at too much of anything else.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">TELL US ABOUT YOU AS A PERSON.. WHAT ARE YOUR
HOBBIES? WHAT DO YOU READ? MOVIES? MUSIC?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>err.. computers, martial arts, scifi, writing, daydreaming. My favourite
movie is called &quot;Ford Fairlane&quot; and I'll listen to just about
any kind of music although I can only handle large quantities of Red Hot
Chilli Peppers and Crowded House</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT (IF ANY) SCENES ARE YOU INVOLVED IN BESIDES
THE VIRUS SCENE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>umm.. I'd have to say the hacking scene and the veg-on-irc scene that
is becoming all too popular.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">DO YOUR FAMILY/FRIENDS KNOW THAT YOU HACK/CODE
VIRUSES? DO YOU CARE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>my family knew from day one that I was getting into viruses and when
I got into hacking the general response was &quot;be careful&quot; which
I attempt to be.. most of my friends wouldn't know what hacking/computer
viruses are and thus wouldn't care but of those that do, they know and
although they tut in disappointment it usually comes up as a talking point
when I'm being introduced to people which is kinda annoying.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">HAVE YOU EVER HAD TROUBLE WITH THE LAW/EMPLOYERS?
DO YOU WORRY THAT YOU WILL?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I worry about the law, yes. But the only real contact I've had with
them was some rumours that they were looking for me when bizatch/boza was
big news.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">DO YOU THINK THE VIRUS SCENE IS TO PARANOID?
I MEAN AFTER ALL WE ARE ONLY WRITING VIRUSES</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>in some countries that's a serious offense and the mythical &quot;all-good&quot;
society that the governments of the world cater for see it as just.. we're
paranoid today to look after tomorrow.. I dont think you can be too paranoid.
personally I enjoy the freedom to be able to do something that may turn
up in the media and not have police knocking on my door<BR>
harassing me for something that is not yet illegal.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">DO YOU THINK THE AV HAVE TOO MUCH HYPE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>the AV feed on hype. It's funny to see professionals coming up with
portraits of a virus writer and the public blindly accepts it.. if the
media did half the amount of research it claimed to do AV profits would
plummet.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER A SUCCESSFUL VIRUS? A
SMALL ONE? A COMPLEX ONE? A SPREAD, COMMON ONE? A DESTRUCTIVE ONE? ONE
WITH MEDIA HYPE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>one that spreads well and is not easily picked up by the AV.. and in
the event that it does it gives then a hell of a hard time.. a little media
hype is not bad but I think that should be a result of it working well..
not AV induced hype.. I cant say destructiveness is a good thing.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE PERFECT VIRUS?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>one that never gets caught, can detect it's own detection and remove
itself, one that can change to a changing environment and , if one day
possible, learn to infect new filetypes and platforms.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHERE DO YOU THINK THE VX SCENE IS HEADING?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>nowhere fast, but it's getting there.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">WHERE DO YOU THINK THE AV SCENE IS HEADING?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>totalitarian suppression of the truth.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">ARE YOU ELITE?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>hell yeah.</P>
