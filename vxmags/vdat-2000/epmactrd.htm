<TD valign="top"><A NAME="1"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">What is a macro
virus and how does it spread?</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> The increasingly sophisticated word
processing and spreadsheet files of today carry many useful macro commands
that provide a variety of features to documents and spreadsheets. For example,
macro commands can perform key tasks, such as saving files every few minutes,
or they can prompt you to type information into a form letter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Macro viruses are special macros that self-replicate
in the data files of personal productivity applications such as Microsoft
Word and Excel. The majority of macro viruses infect Word document files.
When a file containing infected macros is opened, the virus usually copies
into Word’s global template file (typically NORMAL.DOT) through the use
of macro commands that are automatically executed at document load time.
Then the virus can infect other Word files. Any document opened or created
after the template has been infected will be infected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Macro viruses, which become part of the document
itself, are transferred with the file from user to user via floppy disk,
file transfer, or e-mail attachment. Macro viruses are the most common
types of computer virus found today. </FONT></P>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="2"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">How does a computer become infected
with a macro virus? </FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Macro viruses usually are written
to infect some or all of the &quot;auto&quot; commands, including AutoOpen,
AutoSave, AutoClose, AutoNew. Since those commands are executed automatically
at the time a document is loaded in Word, it is likely that you will not
notice the infection.</FONT></P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="3"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">How do macro viruses work?</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Macro viruses gain access to word
processing and spreadsheet files by attaching themselves to the executable
portion of the document - usually replacing the AutoOpen, AutoExec, AutoNew,
AutoClose, AutoExit macro commands </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Macro viruses are particularly difficult to eradicate
because they can hide in attachments to old e-mail messages. For example,
a network once infected by a macro virus can become re-infected when an
employee returns from vacation and opens an old e-mail attachment with
a virus. When the employee forwards it to others on the network, the virus
can spread again, necessitating a second round of detection and disinfection.</FONT></P>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="4"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Why are Word macro viruses so
easy to create?</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Prior to the macro virus era, creating
a virus required some knowledge of assembly language or other complex programming
language. Today, almost anyone can write a macro virus using Visual Basic,
which uses English-like commands. There is even a guided step-by-step template
for creating Word macro viruses available on the Internet. Most macro viruses
are slight modification of existing macro viruses.</FONT></P>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="5"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">What versions of Word are susceptible
to macro viruses? </FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Macro viruses can infect any version
of Word that has the ability to run macros. This includes Word 6.x for
both Macintosh and Windows and Word 7 for Windows '95. Word 8 has a built-in,
but limited Macro Virus Protection Tool. </FONT></P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="6"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">What’s the worse damage a macro
virus can do?</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Like all computer viruses, macro viruses
can destroy data. For individual users, the worst thing a macro virus might
do is reformat their computer’s hard drive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Corporations are taking a heavy hit from macro viruses,
which can restrict file-saving operations, manipulate information, control
data storage, and reformat the hard drives of every PC hit by the virus
in the company. While most of the more than 500 known macro viruses are
not destructive, many cause a considerable loss of productivity and staff
time. </FONT></P>

<TR>
<TD><A NAME="7"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Why don’t traditional detection
techniques work on macro viruses?</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are a combination of factors. Before macro
viruses were first noted in August of 1995, anti-virus software scanned
only executable files and boot sectors, the early targets of computer viruses.
Macro viruses infect Word and Excel documents, whose internal structure
is very different from executable files or boot sectors. Document files
use an intricate OLE structure that required changes in the way anti-virus
software looked into files. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition, because of the high number of variants
of macro viruses, early pattern-matching techniques wee not always efficient
enough to ensure proper detection. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, the way Word and Excel documents are shared
(via e-mail attachments) required new techniques to enable anti-virus software
to check inside e-mail databases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To protect against macro viruses, home users should
update to new software capable of scanning e-mail attachments, and network
administrators should investigate software designed specifically for their
e-mail environments such as InterScan VirusWall or Trend’s ScanMail series.

to detect them in the white paper &quot;Trapping the World’s Most Prevalent
Viruses.&quot;</FONT></P>

<TD><A NAME="8"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">What is Trend Micro’s MacroTrap</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">&auml;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
technology?</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Answer:</B> Trend Micro’s patented MacroTrap is
a rule-based scanning engine that instantly detects and cleans known and
unknown macro viruses, eliminating the time-consuming steps that traditional
virus vendors require (collect new viruses, analyze them, create a detection
pattern, release new pattern files). MacroTrap is based on OLE2 (object
linking and embedding) technology - the same structure at the basis of
Word and Excel files. This allows MacroTrap to efficiently extract only
the macro portion of each word processing or spreadsheet file it examines.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to high-speed scanning performance, this
approach reduces the likelihood of false-positive virus indications, which
are possible when large text files are scanned. After extracting the macro
code, MacroTrap compares it with patterns from known viruses. If a match
is found, MacroTrap alerts the user. Otherwise, the anti-virus software
applies a comprehensive set of intelligent binary rules that can detect
the presence of almost all macro viruses. Moreover, since the rule sets
are external files constructed by Trend, we can periodically update these
files to adapt the rule database to new forms of macro viruses, and eliminate
false positives that may occur.</FONT></P>
