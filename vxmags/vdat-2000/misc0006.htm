<P>Long-time readers of <A HREF="ezines1.htm#CRYPT">Crypt Newsletter</A>
will be astonished to hear death -- due to heroin overdose -- came to the
famous Australian virus-writer Clint Haines on his twenty-first birthday,
April 10. He was from Brisbane. </P>

<P>Writing in the Usenet comp.virus newsgroup On April 19, Rod Fewster,
a moderator of one of the Fidonet's virus information newsfeeds and one
who knew Haines, said: </P>

<P>&quot;Clinton Haines, who earned his place in virus-writing history
at the age of fifteen as Harry McBungus, became a household name in the
virus world by the time he was eighteen as Terminator-Z and TaLoN . . .
[Haines] gained widespread fame a couple of years ago with front-page newspaper
headlines yelling about how his No Frills virus had stopped the Australian
Taxation Office dead in its tracks for two days, and was regarded by his
peers as one of the best virus writers of all time . . . [He] will be cremated
tomorrow morning. </P>

<P>&quot;Clint quit virus writing two years ago to concentrate on his university
studies and he had the intelligence to go a long way in his chosen field
of microbiology, but unfortunately being intelligent doesn't always give
you street smarts. </P>

<P>&quot;Clinton Haines/Harry McBungus/Terminator-Z/TaLoN died from an
overdose of heroin . . . on his twenty-first birthday.&quot; </P>

<P>Haines' interest in controlled substances could be seen in frequent
posts to the Usenet where the University of Queensland student waxed enthusiastically
on topics ranging from the synthesis of LSD and methamphetamines to his
own experiences with Prozac. In April, it all came off the rails, rendering
him dead and an acquaintance comatose. </P>

<P>For example, on the date-rape drug, rohypnol: &quot;. . . a friend of
mine had 10 rohypnols and a 6-pack, woke up in the lockup with 25 stitches
in his head and a broken arm, and couldn't remember a single thing from
the last 12 hours . . . turns out he was vandalizing a train seat and the
security guards beat the shit out of him . . . then he got off at the next
station only to try skateboarding and broke his arm.&quot; </P>

<P>On speed and LSD: &quot;. . . I assure you people that LSD and amphetamines
are a rather wondrous combination, the ceaseless and energetic progression
of thought along a myriad gossamer threads of abstract reality . . . throw
nitrous on top of that and you have God mode happening . . . thinking is
simply a matter of choosing where you want to go inside your mind and insight/thought
rushes abound to the point of not having enough time in which to follow
every branch point . . . to the point where your individual thought threads
meld themselves into higher denominations . . .&quot; </P>

<P>Haines rambled wildly on his thrill at sniffing laughing gas: &quot;.
. . nitrousing out in this state of mind can be wicked because you go so
far out on a mental limb . . . sometimes you get to this point where everything
becomes completely fluid, not in the physical sense, but one can see, perceive,
visualize, etc., every ramification of everything that goes on in the particular
mental environment you construct . . . including, say, the passage of a
tennis ball under the influence of gravity, or the evolution of an argument
and the interplay of multiple factors, even your own thought reasoning
. . . when one nitrouses out to a point of total thought fusion, and the
concurrent realization/visualization of an extended range of thought capabilities
occurs, one gets the rare chance to 'refit' aspects of one's mind, much
like getting into newly-washed clothes or something.&quot; </P>

<P>And, sadly, on heroin synthesis in a post on September 20, 1996: &quot;WARNING
---- MAKE SURE you cut the rock so produced down to NO MORE than 30% purity
-- otherwise you'll end up killing a whole bunch of people . . street-grade
heroin is usually in the range of 10-20%, maximum.&quot; </P>

<P>The Australian VLAD virus-writing group promptly published a memorial
virus to Haines, called &quot;RIP Terminator Z,&quot; according to a story
by technology writer Julie Robotham in a piece published in the April 29
edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. </P>

<P>Fewster commented to Crypt Newsletter, &quot;[Clint Haines] had a bright
future ahead of him, and in my opinion could have done some good in the
world if he'd just kept his head together.&quot; </P>

<CENTER><P><B>ANOTHER VERY BRIEF TALE OF MYSTERY AND INTRIGUE</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B>Crypt Newsletter, April 1995</B></P></CENTER>

<P>Virus-programmer Clinton Haines, a science student at the University
of Queensland and native of Brisbane, Australia, makes it into the newsletter
this month for making himself the Dark Avenger of Oz. </P>

<P>Over the past three years, &quot;Confusion to your enemies&quot; could
have been Haines' motto. Originally known as Harry McBungus, later as Terminator-Z
and Talon in Oz-cyberspace, Haines busied himself over a series of viruses
which came to be known as the NoFrills/Dudley family.</P>

<P>Around 1991, one of the first of the NoFrills viruses, X-Fungus/PuKE,
heavily infected SunCorp, a government-operated insurance company which
has since been privatized. SunCorp, which employs quite a bit of Novell
software, found its networks blasted off-line by NoFrills and the event
splashed into Australian newspapers.</P>

<P>According to members of virus-writing groups with which Haines was associated,
he took the opportunity to contact local newsmen who subsequently turned
over his identity to just about anyone who wanted it. Following the SunCorp
incident, Haines was interviewed by Australian federal agents. During the
free-for-all, according to other virus writers, the inventive Haines attempted
to stymie the investigation by informing his interrogators that Terminator-Z
and Harry McBungus were the names of different computer hackers who had
written viruses mistakenly attributed to him.</P>

<P>Around the same time, Haines applied for membership in the predominantly
North American virus-writing group, <A HREF="groups2.htm#NUKE">NuKE</A>
. Paradoxically, Haines had written the original X-Fungus/PuKE/NoFrills
virus which struck SunCorp with an eye toward satirizing the same band
of hackers.</P>

<P>Another of the NoFrills viruses - named Dudley - then found its way
into PC networks operated by Australian Telecom, sufficiently incommoding
the company so that the Australian federales were again summoned. This
led to squabbling, recriminations and an eventual falling out with Haines'
North American cybercolleagues who evidently became suspicious the Australian
was trying to thrust the notoriety for the Dudley debacle onto them. The
complete source code to a Dudley variant, the Daeman virus, was immediately
released into the public domain of cyberspace in the electronic publication,
NuKE Infojournal, edited by the North American group. Since then Haines
has advertised an on-again-off-again relationship with the same group of
virus programmers he pretends to make fun of.</P>

<P>In early March of this year, the Dudley virus again fritzed Australian
networks, this time those belonging to the Australian Taxation Office.
This was seen as tactically unfortunate, since Haines had claimed retirement
from virus-writing. The Australian Taxation Office is regarded as balefully
as the IRS in the United States.</P>

<P>However, Haines reputation as a virus-writer in international cyberspatial
circles remains solid, even gaining in stature. Rod Fewster, an Australian
representative of the Dutch Thunderbyte anti-virus software company, had
befriended Haines, recognized Harry McBungus' technical brilliance as a
virus writer and publicly mused on the Fidonet on the consequences of infecting
the Australian Taxation Office and it getting in the way of a good programming
career. Recently, Qark, another Australian virus-writer, informally commented
that it was his opinion Haines was, in all respects, a world-class virus
programmer and that it was Harry McBungus' original appearance in the Australian
press at the time of the SunCorp/X-Fungus incident which inspired him to
take up his present hobby as a programmer of software of the same nature.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>YOUNG, FAST &amp; SCIENTIFIC: AUSTRALIAN VIRUS WRITER NO
NERD -- ENJOYS RUGBY, DAD A TENNIS PRO COACH</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B>Crypt Newsletter, April 1995</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B>by Peter Young</B></P></CENTER>

<P>Old Clint Haines blew his cover in February after the Dudley virus hit
so my [original] promise to keep his ID to myself is null and void.</P>

<P>Clint wrote a virus called K-Mart [sometimes refered to as X-Fungus]
under the name of Harry McBungus in late 1991 and in February 1992 it infected
the largest financial institution in Queensland, Suncorp, forcing the organization
to quarantine 100 workstations and 12 servers while it purged the virus.
The virus escaped into the wild because Haines had a habit of giving diskettes
containing it to schoolmates he didn't like. He later refined it and in
its next incarnation it was tagged No Frills. A version of No Frills hit
Australian Telecom's International Business Offices almost a year to the
day after the Suncorp infection. Telecom had to isolate and rebuild 1000
PCs on Novell networks.</P>

<P>Coincidentally or otherwise, the No Frills/Dudley attack on the Australian
Tax Office this year again took place in February.</P>

<P>Haines was 15 when he wrote the original Suncorp virus, referred to
on this piece as K-Mart. He's well over six feet tall, plays the Aussie
version of gridiron - that's rugby - and bears no resemblance to the skinny
nerd of stereotypic virus writer legend. He's come up through private schools
and is the child of separated or divorced parents. His dad is a tennis
pro coach. Haines doesn't regret writing the NoFrills viruses but does
rue that his association with them may cost him the option of a career
in computing. He told me his first reaction when a new No Frills hit is
reported is a surge of delight that it's still out there working its magic
and hasn't been retired to a virus museum or old folk's home. On the heels
of the thrill comes an anxiety attack while he wonders whether some hammer
is about to fall on him. He's 19 and an undergraduate taking a science
degree at the University of Queensland. He's majoring in biochemistry and
. . . here's a scary thought . . . thinks biological viruses are fascinating.</P>
