 Well, if you read the "Heuristic technology" in this  same magazine, and you
 didn't like that kind article, just keep your hands away of this article too
 because i'm going to talk about some other related stuff like that one. Yes,
 this is one of an article serials, dedicated to oddities :)
</P>
<P> <b>% Brief Introduction %</b></P>
<P>
 After seeing the article's name you can think that this document is going to
 talk about  the virus die in  AV hands. No, this  article won't discuss that
 (interesting anyway) theme, it  will talk about the  matter of  make viruses 
 to have human features (born, grow, reproduce and die). Seems sci-fi huh? :)
 Well, this is a circle, as the life is. Let's see a little diagram.
</P>
<blockquote>

<P> In this article i will discuss each one of that points, specially born, reproduce 
  and die. Grow is as well very important, but i will comment it less, as it's 
  a normal statement (well, you will see it later). so, it's time to begin. </P>
<P> <b>% A new virus has born %</b></P>
<P>
 We can arrive  to this point  in two ways: the virus  has just entered a new
 computer, an  unexplored land, another world, or the parent-virus created it
 and it has to adapt itself to the system. 
</P><P>
 In the first case, the virus has to adapt quickly to the system, because the
 critical process of the infection happens  just at this time, when the virus
 has just begun to infect the system. If the user  don't notice the virus the
 first days, everything is easier.
</P><P>
 The second thing that could happen is that the virus is the "son" of another
 one, then if the  parent remained undetected, we can have less care (anyway,
 we must make it to follow rules), but  without passing  the line, because at
 this time there'll be  two viruses in the  system, and if  the user notices,
 everything will  go hell. The  process of  how we can make a virus to create
 another one will be explained in the "reproduction" part.
</P><P>
 New infection.-

<P> <b>% Grow, my little baby %</b></P>
<P>
 Well, this statement  is quite  simple. I mean  with "grow" the steps of the
 evolution of  the virus related  to its own  polymorphic engine, or, said in
 another way, its  self process of  polymorphy. Also, at this point the virus
 is saving useful information for its own safety.
</P>
<P> <b>% Let's fuck! Reproduce! %</b></P>
<P>
 This  is the most (under my viewpoint) important  part of the life-die game.
 I think that  could be done as i'm going to explain. Imagine we have a (big)
 code generator, that always travel with  the virus. That code generator must
 be able of generate  a whole new  virus from zero. Well, let's see a diagram
 of how the code generator could be:

      calls.

<P> If after the diagram, you still have any doubt of what i am trying to explain 
  just read the following lines. BTW, as you have realized, the size of the boxes 
  of above is symbolic: the biggest one is what does the most general job, anyhow, 
  it's the smalles part in bytes of the code, so bigger the box is, smaller is 
  the code. </P>
<P>
 Main.- This code represents for  the "life and die" idea the main branch, as
 it should have the right calls for  generate a whole new virus starting from
 nothing... it must set up all the variables, look up for where the new virus
 will be placed in memory, etc. The calls for  generate the new virus just go
 to the routines for generate the big parts  of the virus. I called here this
 routines "Blocks". For example:
</P><PRE>      
                [...]
                call    InitVariables
                call    GetMemory
                call    GenerateVirus
                [...]
</PRE><P>
 Blocks.- This code must be able to do the appropiated calls for generate the
 blocks that form a virus, such as the "Go TSR" part in a TSR virus, the poly
 engine, the  infection, and the "return  control to host" part. That code as
 well is formed of subroutines too, that are from the Big Routines part.
</P><P>
 Big Routines.- This code must be dessigned for do more specific job than the
 above. Here would be included the algorithm for  search files  in a runtime,
 the algorithm for allocate memory, the interrupt handlers, etc.
</P><P>
 Routines.- This code will do  the functions  such as put the required values
 in the right places, and then perform an  action, such as open a file, close
 it, map, unmap, set end of file, append viral code, etc.
</P>
<P> Opcode.- We are in the base, and the biggest part of the code. We must be 
  able to regenerate all the required instructions, in machine-code, and we must 
  be able to generate here the MOVs, ADDs, SUBs, XORs, i.e all the possible instructions 
  that a virus could use. There is required high knowledge of the lowest level 
  of programming. I recommend you to have the whole list of opcodes, and to have 
  a clear idea about what you must do for generate indexed movs, adds, and such 
  like. I think that this part of the code generator would be full of calls, that 
  put a simple opcode, two opcodes, all depending of our needs. </P>
<PRE>
 gen_MOV_E??_imm32:                                     ; Reg given in AL
                add     al,0B8h
                stosb
                mov     eax,ebx                         ; Imm32 given in EBX
                stosd
                ret
</PRE>
<P> Hmm. It could be also done (and really more optimized) with tables. Two tables 
  i think: one for the opcodes themselves, and another for have the information 
  that should use each opcode. </P>
<P>
 So one step wouldn't be nothing without all rest. The  structure of the code
 as  i described  before  would be  very unoptimized, but  what the fuck: the
 computers nowadays have a lot of HD space, so... I think  that nothing would
 happen if our virus is about 30K :)
</P>
<P> Of course, for test at build time if it works or not, we must use a very powerful 
  code emulator, and correct what's wrong. I suggest you that is better if we 
  try to do it good from the beginning. Could our code generator life without 
  an emulator? Yes. But i consider that if we randomize more the whole thing, 
  we need it in order to avoid some possible fails and don't wanted crashes. </P>

<P> <b>% There's a time to die %</b></P>
<P> Yeah, our virus reached the end of his life. We must decide how many time 
  it should live (we can use for count da time how many times the virus goes resident 
  since born, time since born, etc.) and then, if it reached its end, and it had 
  descendence, kill him. How? Many things could be done. Now, in my mind there 
  are to possibilities: act like a runtime with its directory traversal routines, 
  and disinfecting all files that seem to be infected by the virus itself, or 
  intercept its way of checking if it's already resident (if the virus generated 
  is TSR), detect the program owner of the process that is requesting such check, 
  and disinfect it. Could seem that we are exterminating ourselves, but take note 
  that the virus have to have a virus son. If it hadn't do it, simply refuse to 
  die. Of course, as i think you are enough clever, the virus son have to have 
  a different way for test its residency, and a different mark for infected files. 
</P>
<P>
 Why kill a virus? Well, many explanations could be done, but better i should
 out you an  example: imagine  that  people doesn't die... we would  have the
 world full  of  unproductive persons  around... Same with  this, we kill the
 virus just because: a) we don't like to have many  viruses  trashing around,
 coz it would slow  down the  system, and b) we  have to evolucionate. That's
 the main target of this document: make you think about the utopic idea of da
 virus evolution. Well, now you have many things for think about.
</P>
<P> <b>% Last words %</b></P>
<P>
 Well, in addition to this little article there is only one thing left to say
 and that is the fact that i will TRY to make this theory to be a fact, i.e.,
 i'll try to code a virus with this. Anyway, i can't promise anything :)
