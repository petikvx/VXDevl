<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>phew. looong time ago. were talking back in the days when people had
vic20's and trs-80's. i dont really remember the how but iirc, it was a
christmas present. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>a lot of my disks became infected with &quot;stoned&quot; and i became
intrigued. my mate Australian Parasite and i were big into cracking and
training back then (circa late 80's, 87?88?). the only viruses around were
stoned and cascade and there was no such thing as &quot;original&quot;
sources only really bad dissasemblies. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>this and that ^_^. i'll take credit for lady death, and the vtboot stuff.
australian parasite and I worked mostly together on some things so the
line can be blurry. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>very hard to pin down. i have an anime + manga (japanese animation +
comics) fetish and also read widely, thats where i draw some stuff from,
mostly its spur of the moment things like a word from a song or phrase.
split second was named after the movie and jitr bugs was named after a
new amiga virus was discovered in australia called jitrs. most of the time
they didnt have names. there are a lot of injokes of course. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>cobol, c++, c, asm, visual basic, some lisp, sql, some oracle, access
basic (vb:) and some tiny obscure things. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>i'm getting in to the c++ now, i like the idea behind it but some of
the execution is a bit erugh ^_^. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are/were you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>yes, first was <A HREF="groups1.htm#AIH">Australian Institute of Hackers</A>,
then I joined [<A HREF="groups2.htm#NUKE">NuKE</A>] for a short time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>the least is easy so I'll start with that. I reaaaally hate VET with
a passion. (VET is australian and here in Melbourne, most schools &amp;
uni's use it.) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are/were your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, back then the aim was to be the smallest possible with the most
functionality, and later to try and be technically good (insofar as a virus
can be....) even if you used tricks that you know will limit its use to
only one machine configuration and noone else in the world has that configuration,
it was still like &quot;pwhoaar, look at this!&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think the &quot;war&quot; was overblown. back in the rabid-esque days
it was a real competitive war, but after that it was not a technical war
anymore, it became an attitude thing, well know AV speakers were always
targeted, you can still read a lot of interviews where VX people have this
opinion of AV and its based on nothing. I've had some good email discussions
with several AV and we've got along well. More VX people need to take the
time to see the AV people as &quot;people&quot; i think. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ooh hehe, well back in the early 80's there was some show (anime) which
name i dont remember but the ninja used a &quot;dark fiber&quot; to strangle
his enemy. later on i think it was Bruce Sterling who used the term in
a book of his about fibre optic cable thats not in use? and people often
think my handle comes from that but it doesnt. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>in the time period of the <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#VCL">VCL</A>, <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#IVP">IVP</A>,
<A HREF="creatrs2.htm#PSMPC">MPC</A>, they served thier purpose well I
think, VCL the most. The aim was to bring viruses to the masses. They no
longer serve their purpose tho, and I think many regret their introduction
altogether. I do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Macro viruses I totally detest! Viruses are about programming and macros
are not. As for HLL viruses, well, I lean to not likeing them. So much
for small and tricky, now we have big, crappy and nothing much beyond companion
viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>many in australia but not many in overseas places. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Ah' I'm an emag junkie, i have hundereds (not all VX ofcourse), <A HREF="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40hex</A>
lead the pack way back when and the next issue is still &quot;two weeks&quot;
^_^ away iirc.... <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> did alright as a
forum for conveying articles and information. the last two or so IR magazines
I've enjoyed. I find I have enjoyed the articles on AV more than the VX
stuff. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Dark Avenger was like &quot;the man&quot; but few ever heard from him
(and none in my part of the world). He was the only &quot;idol&quot; back
when I was around. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, tough question. Alan Solomon has my vote I guess, of the AV guys
i've emailed and so forth, as for others, I dont know who is and isnt around
anymore. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>As in just ordinary people I admire? Oda Nobunga, Temujin (the Khan),
musashi miyamoto, sun tzu, bodhiharma (Ta Mo), and my si-gung William Chueng.
The reasons of which I wont go into. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>catch 22. I've done one or two so who am I to talk? I dont like them.
to infect someones machine is one thing but to erase work, memories and
maybe someones living is not something I like. Payloads only make detection
that much quicker. then again, maybe thats what the author wants? I know
i had a chip on my shoulder and an attitude and a half at one stage. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>according to whose ideas? :) Ves' famous paper? If so then no. But in
the context of what is possible, then yes. a good virus is one that infects
a mahcine and does not interrupt its use in any way, which most people
will see as a contridiction but...... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>computer programmer and a small bit of systems analysis. I also do martial
arts and write. those who knew me in the virus scene knew I loved writing
articles of some kind, i did several of my own non vx magazines. Even contemplated
giving up computers for good and going into writing but..... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did people outside the VX scene know what you
did (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nobody but a few close friends ever knew what I did. My parents never
knew, but a couple of my girlfriends knew. non computer literate people
either see it as something atrocious or dont know what to think of it.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Did you do other computer stuff outside VX
(Hacking, phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>yeah, I grew up in the cracking/training scenee. c64's, vic20's apples,
etc. I still did demo coding on an irregular basis. I was more of a utils
kinda person than anything. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>deliberate spreading? hands up how many old timers who never infected
a copy of scan or something? I ranted on before over the &quot;legal&quot;
thing. I think it boils down to some form of punishment if you deliberately
infect some business. if your going to deliberatly infect a business then
you AIM to do harm or you wouldnt do it. Its a very grey issue i think.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmm. non-realisticly? to be as small as possible, infectinf all known
types of executables. multiplatform is optional. the aim of a virus is
to spread, so things like a polymorphic engine are only added extras. comes
with free airconditioning. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It was inevitable. Computers for the masses, I dont have a huge &quot;hate&quot;
for it. It was smart business on microsofts behalf. as a product it succeeds
i think. as a marketing tool it goes beyond everything. from a geek point
of view? i still wouldnt get rid of it, for what it aims to do i think
it does well. collectivly unifying all the hardware + software interfaces
so you only need to write to one driver api, etc. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>not to bother really. I dont think a newbie could make it (beyond shitty
macro crap). Who learns assembler nowdays? I think some of the new windows
viruses were writen in a HL? I woudlnt advise anyone to get into the virus
scene now. maybe they should try the emulation scene? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>well i've had the same email address for eons, which is still <A HREF="mailto:entropy@mpx.com.au">entropy@mpx.com.au</A>
and yes, i STILL get mail asking me for the password for VCL. I never found
out who but someone put it in the documentation for it. -_- ahh well. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>quark, metabolis, unforgiven and metal militia oh and slash wu! hi guys,
hope all is well with your lives and loves. gan batte ne! </P>
