<p>Below is the results of an 'unforgiven style' interview between myself and 
  Midnyte. Midnyte is one of a few UK virus programmers and a member of underground 
  group <a href="groups2.htm#UCSI">Ultimate Chaos</a>. </p>
<p><b><font color="#004080">Give us a short description of who you are. (Handle, 
  interests, occupation, music, films, location, marital status etc.)</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm MidNyte, 23 year old male from Southampton UK. I like to program, do 
    computer graphics and I play guitar in a band (Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Manic 
    Street Preachers, Offspring etc). My favourite film is 'Dazed & Confused', 
    and watch it all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What made you choose your handle?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I love the night-time, I prefer to be out in the dark than the light, driving 
    or walking. I wanted a handle to reflect that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have you ever had any previous identities in the computer 
  underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use the handle NyteShade as my alternative on IRC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>When did you first get into computers?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I learned to program when I was about 13, I learned BASIC from a ZX81 manual 
    without access to the ZX81 (it was broken). Eventually I got a ZX Spectrum 
    +2 and then an IBM XT on which I learned PASCAL. After that I got an AMIGA 
    and just played games and mad music with it until I got a decent spec. PC 
    again a few years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What operating system(s) are you currently running?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Plain old Windows 95 on a Cyrix PII-300 with 32Mb RAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How and when did you first discover the computer underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was always interested in all aspects of H/P/A/C/V and had a copy of Jolly 
    Roger's Anarchist Cookbook from when I was about 13, but I never really got 
    into it until I got internet access with my first decent PC. I was searching 
    for viruses after being infected with One Half and wanting to know more about 
    it. I stumbled across pages and pages of tutorials, and haven't looked back 
    since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you first get into virus programming?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was infected by One Half at work and I was intrigued because I had no idea 
    of what a virus was really all about. I went off looking for information on 
    it as soon as I had internet access and found more information than I'd though 
    possible.. tutorials, programs that would make 100's of viruses, source code 
    and compilers etc. I was interested because there was always something new 
    to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you have an interest in the other components of 
  the computer underground? (hack/phreak/warez etc.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yep, all of the above. Although I can't do anything in those fields, I do 
    like to read about it and keep up with what's going on, phreaking especially. 
    I was into phreaking before I was into viruses, right back before I had a 
    decent PC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you consider yourself to be a criminal?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No. I would never spread my viruses, I never give them to anyone I don't 
    trust so they are only ever a threat to my own computer (not even much of 
    a threat). If I want to destroy my computer with a hammer, I can, so exposing 
    it to a virus is also up to me, in my opinion, as long as I don't pass around 
    executable files which are infected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do the recent changes to virus writing law worry you?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, but mainly because it is too restricting, it would be too easy for the 
    establishment to charge you with intent to spread viruses when you have no 
    such desire. Just keeping a collection of viruses on an internet capable computer 
    could possibly be seen as intent to spread. I've not written any viruses since 
    the change in the law (due to time), and I never have or will spread viruses. 
    I don't think there is anything wrong with writing viruses in the way I do, 
    just to challenge my programming skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do your friends/family/colleagues know about your 
  interest in the computer underground?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A few do, but they don't really understand about viruses or the various scenes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What are your opinions on virii with destructive payloads?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think they serve to back up the opinions of the people who think that all 
    virus writing is evil, which is not right in my opinion. I think it's a way 
    to get attention for a virus, and that people who can't code an impressive 
    virus use it to get a reaction from the public. I see it as a sign of admitting 
    that your virus isn't very good, 'This is crap, but if I put this in people 
    will take notice' kind of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you get involved with the virus group Ultimate 
  Chaos?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whilst I was getting started with viruses, I spent a lot of time talking 
    to Rhape79 (the founder) who is also in the UK. When it came to joining a 
    group, UC were the obvious choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How many people are in the Ultimate Chaos group?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At he time of writing (03/01/2000), eleven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do Ultimate Chaos concern themselves with virus programming 
  only?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We used to be in alliance with 3rd World Domination (3WD), a H/P/A group, 
    but parted company quite a while ago. We were then mainly virus orientated, 
    but are now making the move to security. We are changing name to <a href="groups2.htm#UCSI">Ultimate 
    Chaos Security International (UCSI).</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have you been a member of any other groups?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was a member of <a href="groups1.htm#INV">Invaders</a> for all of 3 weeks. 
    It was when I had only occasional internet access and before I could write 
    a virus. I joined the group to be the webmaster and Buz agreed to help teach 
    me in return. Unfortunately, three weeks after I joined I lost my access completely 
    for around six months and when I was around again Invaders was disbanded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Why did you start learning Assembly? Was it because 
  you wanted to write viruses or could you already code in ASM?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'd always wanted to learn assembly, but until I saw a virus source code 
    explained in a tutorial I had no idea where to start. Now I can do a few things 
    in assembly, I use it for other stuff too, not just virus-orientated material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What other languages can you program in?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>BASIC (who can't?), PASCAL and AMOS (what I can remember of it, not much)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of viruses written in languages 
  other that assembly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think that's fine if it's your thing, but it's not mine. I like the rigidity 
    of assembly language, being able to have a program self-modify with ease. 
    Macro viruses have never interested me though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What groups do you value most highly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I admire the way that the <a href="groups1.htm#CB">Codebreakers</a> 
    will tackle problems like lack of security by bringing it into the publics 
    view, even though the only way they can do that is with the scare tactics 
    of viruses. Take Caligula for example, which stole PGP secret keys and mailed 
    them back to the codebreakers; the security of PGP was flawed because people 
    had secret keys lying around unsecure, and the fact that a virus could take 
    advantage of that made people take notice and sort out their security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Which individual programmers do you value most highly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone who pushes the boundries or tries something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What zines do you read regularly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every one I can!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of the virus scene? (Both in general 
  and in the UK.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think it's getting more attention than before, which is in turn attracting 
    more of the same old debate. There's not much willingness among the public 
    to actually find out why people would want to write viruses in the first place, 
    which can only lead to conflict. The public's stubborness is only daring people 
    to do their worst, in my opinion. For example, you get people who know nothing 
    about viruses coming onto alt.com.virus and saying all virus writers are evil 
    and should be strung up. I think that just makes virus writers less likely 
    to care about the public, ie, more likely to release a virus into the wild. 
    Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but you have to understand what 
    you're talking about first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How has the underground scene changed since you first 
  entered?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't think it has much, I think it's just grown. The growth does seem 
    to be concentrated in the idiot part of the VX population though :(</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think the future of virus writing holds?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think it will continue as before, tit for tat with the anti-virus industry, 
    becoming more and more complex just to keep the same level of functionality 
    whilst still being undetected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you believe in a 'perfect virus'? And if so describe 
  it.</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think a perfect virus would only have to be perfect in respect to remaining 
    undetectable with a normal algorithm. That way no AV program would be good 
    enough to use against it unless it was huge and slow. The viruses best weapon 
    against an AV program in my opinion is simply slowing it down. That way the 
    user does the dirty work of disabling the AV because they can't be bothered 
    to use it as much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What advice would you give to newbies entering the 
  virus scene?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Read as many tutorials as you can! (VDAT is the best way to do this, get 
    it from <a href="http://www.ultimatechaos.com">http://www.ultimatechaos.com</a>). 
    Try not to learn from just one, read a few on the same subject first, then 
    follow the one that seamed the clearest. If you don't follow anything in one, 
    check it out in another. Don't go jumping the gun, try each successive step 
    even if you think you don't need to, there's always something that doesn't 
    quite work how you think it would. (The steps I follow are: COM overwriter, 
    COM appender, Encrypted COM appender, EXE appender, Encrypted EXE appender, 
    etc) Finally, don't be afraid to ask for help in Undernet's #virus channel, 
    what can you lose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Anything you would like to add?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virus-Authors: Don't be happy with just encrypting with XOR, think of something 
    better! XOR is not much better than nothing at all these days. It hides your 
    text from a text viewer but it's so easy to see through it's not much use 
    against anything else. I have tutorials on my site (and in VDAT) about more 
    advanced encryption methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Any greets?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To everyone I know. (It's not a cop-out, I really mean it :)</p>
</blockquote>
