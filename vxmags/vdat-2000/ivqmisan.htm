<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In the 7th grade (1972), I was first introduced to a computer. Our school
had a program where they took us to the University each Friday. We got
to play on 110 baud teletypes. We learned BASIC. I knew then that I wanted
a computer. I built my first computer: an Altair, 4K memory, No OS, in
High School (1975). I sold it and built my second one: Processor Technologies
S-100 mother board with 60K of Godbout memory, an IMSAI Front Panel, 2
Northstar 89k floppy drives with a Northstar Math Processor Board. It was
a kick-ass system. I had Electric Pencil, BASIC, DEBUG and CPM. I was the
only person to have a word processing system in High School (1976). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I wrote my first Rabbit Program (Program that makes another Program
then chains to it, fills the disk) in 1972 in BASIC. My first ASM virus
was in 1992 (SNAFU) I only released it to Make-A-Fee. I now see that AVP
now has it. I would like to get a copy of it, as none exist on my systems.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written <A HREF="collect.htm#Q">viruses</A>?
If so which would you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>SNAFU with 13 variations. (See above)</P>

<P>Gold-Bug, Da'Boys and XYZ or Pure.b as it is now called. (All three
were released as a package that worked together) Gold-Bug was to be the
best of all viruses with all sorts of features. Although Da'Boys seems
to travel the best.</P>

<P>A bunch of variations on the XYZ virus followed. Pure, Purest, PurePlus,
Funked, MUMZI!, XYZ-V2.</P>

<P>De'Bugger would blow the CMOS if the virus was debugged.</P>

<P>Shimmer1 and Shimmer2 were cool in that they were BAT, COM, EXE and
Boot sectors all in one.</P>

<P>Q-Ball and 8-Ball were cool in that they did not have an executable
extension (Not .EXE .COM or .SYS etc.)</P>

<P>Pure'cyst was my attempt to make a CMOS modifying boot sector virus
that infected both MBR and DBR.</P>

<P>Purple Cum was a MBR and DBR boot sector virus that did not change the
655360 byte value in CHKDSK.</P>

<P>I_Owe was strange in that it only infected C:\IO.SYS</P>

<P>Winstart was to show a hole in the MS Windows program. (You shouldn't
automatically launch a file.)</P>

<P>Winstart.Ditty was just a simple Batch File Worm.</P>

<P>Winstart.Ramble was a Batch File Worm released from a 123 Document.</P>

<P>Da'Boys.Q2 another variation.</P>

<P>Morality Play was to be a Good Virus and show the evils of the AV community.</P>

<P>HighJaq was a cool virus that was for Hacking a PC.</P>

<P>You_got_it and You_name_it were Windows 95 Boot sector viruses. (It
might be in <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A-2</A>.)</P>

<P>HMABoot will boot straight into HMA Memory. (It should be in 29A-2.)
NULSpace is the newest and coolest way to hide your Virus. (It should be
in 29A-2.)</P>

<P>Borg uses NULSpace, Winstart and You_got_it technology.</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>God tells me. I don't know. Whatever I feel like at the time. Da'Boys
was written for the Dallas Cowboys winning the Super Bowl (I hate football.)
Gold-Bug because the only string I could include was AU (chemical element
for Gold) Purple Cum got it's name because it had to have RPL 3 bytes after
the INT 2f handler for the 4A06h feature of INT 2f to work. Shimmer was
named after Saturday Night Live's Television commercial. Pure'cyst was
a play on words. HighJaq because your PC could become completely High Jacked
(complete security invasion.) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>8080, 6800, 6502, 8086, C, Pascal, FORTRAN, APL, and BASIC. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Assembly of course. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>More like a guest writer for <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A>. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>AVP rules. Make-A-Fee sucks. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Do more bizarre stuff. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I just fueled the flames with NUL Space residency. Good luck AV in solving
this problem. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>From <B>Star Trek The Next Generation</B>. Deja Q episode. </P>

<P><B>Picard</B>: &quot;Return that moon to its orbit.&quot; </P>

<P><B>Q</B>: &quot;I have no powers! Q, the ordinary!&quot; </P>

<P><B>Picard</B>: &quot;Q, the liar! Q, the misanthrope!&quot; </P>

<P><B>Q</B>: &quot;Q, the miserable, Q, the desperate! What must I do to
convince you people?&quot; </P>

<P><B>Worf</B>: &quot;Die.&quot; </P>

<P><B>Q</B>: &quot;Oh, very clever, Worf. Eat any good books lately?&quot;
</P>

<P>It doesn't mean anything. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(e.g. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Lame to use, hard to write. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I haven't yet ventured into the macro world. Don't really think I want
to. I love tight code. You can't get that with macros. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Gold-Bug and Da'Boys. I didn't put them there. See what happens when
you give loaded guns to idiots. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The most is the next one that comes out. I can't get enough of them.
The least is in non-English because I don't know any other written language.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> comes to mind. I respect anyone
who pushes the envelope, takes risks and invents something new. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Eugene Kaspersky seems to have his act together. He can analyze my code
pretty good. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I respect anyone who pushes the envelope, takes risks and invents something
new. The Wright brothers, Montgolfier brothers, Edison, the person who
invented the zipper or bubble gum, etc. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like destructive payloads. Trash the data is bad. Mess with
the user is good. Make the hardware malfunction weirdly is good. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Been there, done that. I made a virus for this very question. The Morality
Play virus will only attach itself to software copied to floppy that is
executed on another PC (different BIOS date and drive C: serial number)
If the pirated software is over 90 days old it would delete itself. It
stops software piracy. The morality play was whether the AV community would
stop it with the premise: &quot;If something immoral is stopping something
that is illegal, should something good interfere with it and allow that
which is illegal to continue?&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>This is real life. I aint in cyber-space yet. Part of my work involves
removing viruses and being a virus expert also doing network security.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, not a one. Everyone in prison will tell you they are there because
they told someone. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Stopped phreaking in 1977. Didn't like the Sheriff and two Ma'Bell guys
showing up at my accomplices house with a warrant to search for his black
box. Kinda put me off phreaking. But I did hack the credit bureaus. (TRW,
CBI, Trans Union and Chilton) Made about 30+ factitious people with wonderful
credit. Went to prison. Not fun. What is warez? Is it just breaking software?
If that is what it is then I still do that. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I always assume that most everything I do is illegal. I was surprised
to find otherwise. Is there a difference between making and using a gun?
Guns can be fun and safe. Viruses can be fun and safe. Guns can kill people.
Viruses can kill data. It all depends on the idiot using it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Can't be detected or removed. When <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A-2</A>
comes out you will be able to play with a perfect virus (NULSpace.) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A lot better that Windows 3.11. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Read every VX E-Zine. Try something, change it and keep evolving it
until it works very well. Learn assembly. Learn how to optimize code. Read
Ralf Browns Interrupt list and all the files that come with it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am a loner so I don't know many people. Qark, Quantum and Sandman
come to mind. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any other comments? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. To Sarah Gordon: It is very obvious why <A HREF="epgenvir.htm">Virus
writers write Viruses</A>: it is a power trip, no other reason. It has
nothing to do with adolescence, I am an old fart, I know better. The reason
the average writer seems to stop is because they normally are not smart
enough to come up with something new. </P>
