<TD>Back around 1990, I was puzzled. By that time, we knew of dozens of
viruses that infected IBM PCs, but we had only seen a handful in real incidents.
The rest were in our ever-growing collection but had not, as far as we
knew, ever infected anyone who didn't infect themselves on purpose. 
<P>True, some of the viruses were just losers - programs so badly written
and so buggy that infected machines would just crash immediately. I didn't
expect to ever see those viruses spread. But many of the others spread
just fine in our lab tests. In fact, some of the viruses we had never seen
in the real world were trivial variants of ones that we had seen. I couldn't
think of anything that could explain why we saw some but not others. </P>

<P>So I wandered down the hall to my friend Dave Chess, and asked him how
this could be. &quot;I dunno,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;Maybe they just
got lucky.&quot; It seemed preposterous at first. Surely there was some
real cause we could point to. Perhaps there was some subtle bug in those
viruses that prevented them from spreading. Perhaps they really were spreading,
but we just hadn't heard about it yet. Or maybe the ones that were spreading
were being spread by some nasty frequent flyer who inserted them on machines
all over the world. </P>

<P>In the years following, Jeff Kephart, Dave Chess and I studied how computer
viruses spread in the world, starting with biological models of viral epidemics.
And it turned out that Dave was right - the reason some viruses spread
worldwide while others languish in labs like ours is simple - they &quot;got
lucky.&quot; </P>

<TD>Imagine an inept pyromaniac, driving down the highway with the window
rolled down, with a huge box of wooden matches in the front seat. Every
so often, he picks up one of the matches, lights it, and flicks it out
the window. Most of the time, the match fizzles out. It bounces into some
bare dirt. Or it gets blown out by the wind. Or it's raining. Every once
in a while, though, it lands near a dry weed, and sparks a tiny fire. And
once in a very great while, one of those matches - maybe fewer than one
in a million - really takes off and burns down some big chunk of Yosemite
National Park. 
<P>What's special about the matches that start huge forest fires? Are they
more cleverly constructed than the others? Do they burn longer? Are they
smarter? No. They just happened to land in a place that could catch fire,
at a time when the fire would spread, and they didn't get stamped out by
a local passerby. It was just random chance. They got lucky. </P>

<P>Virus writers are the inept pyromaniacs of the computer world. They
write their little match stick programs, perhaps hoping to start a conflagration.
Then they toss them out into the world. Most of them just fizzle out. But
once in a while, a virus gets lucky in the beginning, and manages to spread
to a bunch of systems, establishing itself as a small, local blaze. And
once in a while, that local blaze gets out of control, and spreads around
the world. </P>

<TD>Biological viruses, computer viruses, and forest fires have something
in common. They spread. And you can think about how they spread in the
same ways. If you're camping, for instance, and sparks from your campfire
start the nearby grass on fire, it's pretty easy to stamp it out if you
get to it quickly. But, as the blaze grows, it's harder and harder to stamp
it out. Ultimately, if it grows into a forest fire, stopping it can be
a huge task. 
<P>When a new computer virus spreads to its first machine, it is as vulnerable
as that spark in the grass. Perhaps some bug keeps it from spreading to
a second machine. Maybe the person who owns the machine, frustrated with
its quirky behavior, decides to reformat the disk and reinstall all the
software, inadvertently eliminating the virus in the process. Or - just
maybe - she is using good anti-virus software, which catches and eliminates
the new virus before it has a chance to spread. That unlucky virus gets
stopped before it gets started. </P>

<P>But what if the virus gets lucky on that first machine, and spreads
to a second one? Now there are two machines that can spread the virus.
The virus could still get unlucky at this point, and get wiped off of both
machines. Or it could spread. And if it spreads, there will be more machines
that can further spread the virus. The fire will have grown larger, and
be harder to stamp out. The more widespread the infection, the more chance
it has of continuing. </P>

<P>If the virus gets lucky, and continues to spread to hundreds, then thousands,
then tens of thousands of machines, it has become the equivalent of a forest
fire - large, widespread, and very difficult to stop. Even if it gets unlucky
on one machine, and gets wiped out there, the other thousands of machines
can keep it going. And that's just what happens. Viruses that establish
themselves in the computer population continue to spread, often for years,
despite the best efforts of people around the world to eliminate them.

<TD>As of July of 1997, there are well over 10,000 known viruses for IBM
PC systems. Of these, only a few hundred - less than 5% - have been seen
in real incidents, anywhere in the world, over the past year. For the most
part, they weren't more cleverly conceived, more craftily written or more
darkly insidious than the others. They just got lucky. </TD>

<TD>The theory that viruses seen in real incidents just &quot;got lucky&quot;
met with understandable skepticism when first introduced to the anti-virus
community. It is now widely accepted, and - believe it or not - the term
&quot;getting lucky&quot; is now part of the technical jargon of anti-virus
folks worldwide. </TD>
