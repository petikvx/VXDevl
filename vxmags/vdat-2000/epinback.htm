a small, cluttered, windowless room lined by PCs. But appearances can be
deceptive. This is the computer equivalent of a high-security microbiology
laboratory equipped to deal with killers such as Ebola virus and the hantavirus.
Hundreds of highly infectious floppy discs lie piled on counters and stuffed
into half-open drawers. The virus isolation laboratory, deep inside IBM's
Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, New York, contains the best part of
the 12 000 or so known computer viruses, as well as the tools needed to
take them apart safely, identify and kill them. 
<P>Jeffrey Kephart sits in front of an oversize monitor that displays the
company's AntiVirus logo. For now, IBM AntiVirus is just one of many virus-fighting
tools. But Kephart has big plans. He is trying to create nothing less than
a global immune system to protect us all from the emerging diseases of
cyberspace. &quot;It's only the existence of an immune system that allows
the human race to exist,&quot; says Steve White. &quot;Only an immune system
in cyberspace will allow it to exist.&quot; </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#9C6300">Electronic organism</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P>To some competitors this sounds like so much hyperbole. But in research
papers Kephart, White and their colleagues have focused on the striking
similarities between a network of computers and a living organism. Insights
from epidemiology and immunology, they argue, can help to protect the electronic
organism from dangerous new infections. They are already testing the idea
on an internal IBM network, and will begin to release parts of their immune
system to the public later this year. </P>

<P>Computer viruses are sneaky programs designed to insinuate their way
into your computer, copy themselves, spread to other computers and, usually,
cause a few symptoms. Those symptoms might be the equivalent of a cold
-- like slowing down your system or the word &quot;Wazza&quot; appearing
mysteriously in documents. Or they might be the digital equivalent of fatal
pneumonia: some viruses head straight for your hard disc and trash it.
</P>

<P>In the past, viruses have passed between computers on floppy discs.
If you boot up your computer with an infected disc in place, or run an
infected program from one, the virus can take over part of your computer'
s memory and copy itself into other files. It can also copy itself onto
any uninfected floppy discs that you may later use in your PC. </P>

<P>A huge industry has grown up to fight the virus threat, selling software
that promises to protect your computer from infection. At the heart of
most of these systems is a virus &quot;scanner&quot;. This is a diagnostic
program that searches every piece of code in your computer's memory for
the &quot;signature&quot; of known viruses. The signature is a small piece
of code, chosen carefully by the creator of the antivirus system, that
always appears in that virus but never in legitimate programs. If the scanner
detects the signature, it warns you that you are infected. </P>

<P>The trouble with these systems is that new viruses are being created
all the time -- at an estimated rate of eight a day and rising -- so the
companies that make antivirus software are forced to play a constant game
of catch-up. When they detect a new virus, they extract a signature, add
it to their software, and every few months send out an updated version.
Inevitably, this means that by the time the updated software is dispatched,
it is already out of date. </P>

<P>Yet this system has worked pretty well up till now. Most new viruses
never spread beyond a few machines. Either they are detected in time, or
they are not very good, says White. Some are so destructive that they crash
their host computer before they have a chance to spread. Even some successful
viruses took years to spread round the world. </P>

<P>But computer networks along with a new family of viruses called macro
viruses are changing all that. The viruses hide in macros -- small programs
that can be attached to documents written with Microsoft's word-processing
package Word. As soon as you open one of these documents, the virus infects
your computer. According to a survey by the National Computer Security
Association (NCSA) in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the biggest problem today
is caused by a macro virus called Concept. It can spread on floppy discs,
but travels mostly on e-mails and files downloaded from the World Wide
Web and bulletin boards. By exploiting networks in this way, macro viruses
have spread round the world in weeks. </P>

<P>&quot;Just as the invention of airplanes caused disease to spread more
quickly than they could by ox carts, the Internet is causing computer viruses
to spread more quickly than they did through diskettes,&quot; says White.
As more and more people use the Internet and other global networks, existing
antivirus methods won' t be able to keep up, he says. New viruses will
spread so quickly that by the time researchers extract a signature and
send out their updated software, the virus will have had time to do serious
damage. Clearly, we need a more rapid way to protect networks. </P>

<P>For inspiration about the form such protection could take, the IBM team
turned to the natural world. After all, computer viruses are forms of artificial
life. Calling them viruses is wholly appropriate, says White. They commandeer
their host' s resources to replicate just as biological viruses do. &quot;The
analogy is breathtakingly deep and important,&quot; he says. </P>

<P>Next they studied how the immune system protects humans. On one level,
the immune system simply destroys anything it recognises as nonhuman. Unfortunately
this strategy is a nonstarter for fighting computer viruses. From time
to time almost all users will install new software on their machines, or
update old programs. A computer immune system that automatically attacks
new programs clearly won' t do the job. But biological immune systems also
have more specific responses. When the body encounters a foreign organism,
it begins to develop antibodies tailored to detect and disable the invader.
The immune system does not need to analyse the entire pathogen. It simply
has to &quot;remember&quot; enough of the virus' s structure to recognise
it in future. Once the initial infection has subsided, the body keeps some
of these antibodies around, so that it can respond to a future infection
much more quickly. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#9C6300">Deliberate infection</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P>This is all similar to what existing antivirus packages do, albeit slowly.
The software systems contain &quot;antibodies&quot; that recognise not
whole viruses, but just their signatures. What White, Kephart and their
colleagues have done is push this analogy further, to make identification
quicker and extend it to include not just individual computers but whole
networks of computers. </P>

<P>In the virus isolation lab, Kephart explains their strategy. He sits
down in front of a computer and runs AntiVirus to confirm that it is free
of known viruses. Then he takes out a floppy disc that he knows is infected
with a &quot;file infecting&quot; virus -- one that infects your computer
from a program file that you run. He sticks the floppy into the drive and
infects the computer. </P>

<P>Then he runs the antivirus software again. He' s chosen a virus that
the system has not seen before, so the signature scanner doesn' t detect
it. But another part of the software -- an integrity checker -- notices
that something is wrong. The checker scans the computer' s programs and
compares them with the way they looked the last time it ran. If it finds
a mismatch, it sounds the alarm. </P>

<P>If the mismatch is caused by a virus, the antivirus software may be
able to patch up the damage. It does this by making educated guesses about
the way a virus normally inserts itself into a program and shifts data
around. If the software manages to reverse these changes, the damaged file
will be restored to health. But success is not guaranteed. </P>

<P>All this is standard stuff: antivirus systems that do this have been
around for years. But it leaves much to be desired. Though the altered
file may have been repaired, the virus that did the damage remains at large,
ready to do wreak more havoc. To seek out and destroy a new virus, the
protection software needs a signature. Worse still, nothing can be done
until somebody, somewhere captures a sample of the virus. Only then will
a specialist programmer be able to study the virus' s anatomy and find
a signature. </P>

<P>White and Kephart's experimental immune system has a way round these
problems. After the infected computer finds out which file the new virus
is hiding in, it encrypts the file and sends it on to IBM's central virus
analyser. This could be done automatically, or under the control of the
user -- or, in a company with a network, the system manager -- who would
send the encrypted program to IBM over the Net. </P>

<P>In the lab demonstration, the virus analyser sits next to the infected
computer, so Kephart merely rolls his chair a couple of feet to the left.
The analyser decrypts the program and scans it again for known viruses,
on the off chance that someone has already reported the virus that is causing
the trouble. But Kephart's analyser doesn't recognise it -- the infection
really is a brand-new virus. </P>

<P>Now the analyser coaxes the virus into revealing itself. The machine
is set up to contain a &quot;virtual computer&quot; within which the virus
can be safely contained and studied. The virtual computer runs the infected
program so that it too becomes infected. It then deploys &quot;decoy&quot;
programs designed to attract the virus. It executes the decoys, reads them,
writes to them, copies them: it manipulates them in as many ways as possible
in an effort to draw out the virus and make it do its worst. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#9C6300">Attach and disguise</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P>After each manipulation, the analyser compares the decoy programs with
their original states to see how the virus has changed them. In this way
it builds up a picture of how the virus attaches itself to the host' s
software, and how it disguises itself by rearranging that software. This
information can later be sent to the remote, infected machine and used
to cut out the virus and repair any damage it has done. </P>

<P>The analyser' s next job is to select a signature to enable the remote
machine' s antivirus software to detect the new virus and avoid future
infection. Extrac-ting a signature from a virus is a tricky task that until
now has always been left to a human expert. &quot;It' s a very arcane skill,&quot;
says White. &quot;It' s useful for almost nothing else.&quot; Computer
viruses often mutate, as some nonvital sections of its code change slightly.
So the signature must come from a section of code that is essential to
the virus. And, of course, the signature must not appear in legitimate
programs, otherwise people may find their expensive programs being attacked
and destroyed by the antivirus software. So the human virus hunters learn
to look for pieces of code that are unique to the functioning of a virus
-- telltale commands that manipulate the computer' s operations in unusual
ways, such as copying themselves into the middle of existing programs.
</P>

<P>But now the IBM researchers want computers to take over the task of
teasing out the signatures of new virus. And since they cannot, yet, create
a computer program that has the insight of a human, they are concentrating
on what computers do best: number crunching. Kephart and White' s automatic
signature extractor compares the virus code to tens of thousands of legitimate
programs, containing gigabytes of code, looking for short command sequences
that do not appear in any of the legitimate programs. The extractor turns
out to be good at its job. In tests carried out at IBM the computerised
version proved to be better at extracting signatures than humans. Finally,
the virus analyser places a call to the remote, infected computer to deliver
the new signature along with instructions on how to repair any damage the
virus might have done. </P>

<P>Kephart's demonstration takes about a minute, with everything up and
running on an experimental network. But he and White want to go further.
The first stage of their plan is for anyone logging on to IBM's Web site
(http://av.ibm.com) to be able to pick up the signature for the new virus,
along with the necessary fix. &quot;Customers could download new signatures
every day, every hour, whatever,&quot; says Kephart. </P>

<P>To provide even faster protection, the two researchers want to make
the whole process automatic. Infected computers will send samples of new
viruses directly to the IBM virus analysis centre, where new methods for
detecting and destroying the virus, and repairing the damage will be devised
automatically. These will then be sent back to the original infected machine.
But they will also be sent all over the world to other participating companies
and computer users. By distributing the cure faster than the virus can
spread, Kephart and White hope that their system will prevent new viruses
from reaching epidemic proportions. &quot;It will work on a very rapid
timescale, and the world will be protected,&quot; says Kephart. IBM will
begin running a pilot program of its immune system in a group of selected
companies later this year. The complete scheme is expected to be go online
shortly after that. </P>

<P>But if the whole of cyberspace is soon to be protected by IBM's immune
system, where will that leave competing antivirus companies? They are not
shutting up shop just yet. Jimmy Kuo is senior virus researcher at California-based
McAfee Associates, which has its own line of antivirus software. He admits
that with the Net and macro viruses, infections will spread more quickly,
and researchers will have a tough time keeping up. But McAfee and its rivals
are already using software tools similar to those in IBM's immune system.
</P>

<P>Kuo does not accept that an automated system will ever be sophisticated
enough to run on its own. &quot;As a goal it' s nice,&quot; he says. &quot;But
ultimately it will be much better to have a person with virus knowledge
review the results.&quot; </P>

<P>Jonathan Wheat of the NCSA sees more potential in the IBM system --
particularly its ability &quot;to head off damage before it happens&quot;,
and then to send out the fixes quickly. Macro viruses have ushered in a
new era, says Wheat. They are easy to write, take no programming skill
and their numbers are increasing rapidly. Without automated systems to
head off macro viruses, the consequences could be dire. &quot;Eventually,&quot;
says Wheat, &quot;it could get to the point where they will be out of control.&quot;
