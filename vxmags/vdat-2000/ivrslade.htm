<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
Rob Slade, the author of previous article and guest of Alive in this issue,
is a data communications and security specialist from Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada. His first love was teaching, and he got into computers
because of an interest in what they could do in improving the education
process in the public school system. He still has links with the education
system in British Columbia with both grade school and the college system,
and writes and speaks for the computer educators in the province. He has
a B.Sc. from the University of British Columbia, a M.S. from the University
of Oregon (in Computer and Information Science Education) and a Diploma
of Christian Studies from Regent College in Vancouver. He is the founder
of the DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society), Canada Education
and Training SIG (Special Interest Group). He is also the founder of the
DECUS Canada Communications SIG and DECUS Canada Security SIG. </P>

<P>Rob Slade has both formal training in data communications and exploration
with the BBS and network community, and has done communications training
for a number of the international commercial seminar firms. His technical
jobs have involved everything from support of terminal emulation programs
to satellite communications. He considers communications technology to
be the most interesting of the various computer fields. </P>

<P>His research into computer viral programs started when they first appeared
as a major problem &quot;in the wild&quot;. Acting initially as the unofficial
archivist for the budding research community, he has since become known
for &quot;Mr. Slade's lists&quot; of antiviral software vendors, antiviral
reviews, antiviral BBSes and virus books. One of the working group for
the VIRUS-L FAQ [Frequently Asked Questions], he is best known for a series
of review and tutorial articles which have recently been published as &quot;Robert
Slade's Guide to Computer Viruses&quot;. </P>

<P>He is more widely known for his series of daily technical book reviews
which appear on appropriate newsgroups and mailing lists, including alt.books.reviews,
rec.arts.books.reviews, the *.books.technical groups and topics related
to the individual titles...etc... </P>

<P>However, it is the time to let Mr Slade to say something himself...
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you get interested in computer viruses
and could you describe shortly your work? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My first exposure was the flurry of messages surrounding the Lehigh
virus and then the Jerusalem (Israeli, as it was then known) virus in the
fall of 1987. I started collecting postings related to viral reports, as
I was interested in what it had to say about the operating systems and
functions. For a time I was the unofficial &quot;archivist&quot; for this
material, before VIRUS-L started up. </P>

<P>I kept on archiving the virus material. In 1990, I noticed an increasing
call for assessments of antiviral software, and started doing reviews.
The list I had to collect in order to find out who made AV [Anti Virus]
software became the CONTACTS.LST, the first of what Fred Cohen called &quot;Mr.
Slade's lists&quot;. It was followed by the quick reference list of antiviral
software reviews. In 1991, just before work got started on the FAQ [Virus-L
Frequently Asked Questions], I started writing a tutorial column on viral
programs. My involvement with Fidonet, when I started to post the columns
to the VIRUS and VIRUS_INFO echoes, became the basis of the AVBBS list.
Ironically enough, when I went to turn all of this into &quot;Robert Slade's
Guide to Computer Viruses&quot; (and that title was *not* my idea, blame
Springer-Verlag), the work I had to do on the book meant I had to *stop*
doing active virus research. I hope to be able to get some more done this
year, but my financial situation is not hopeful. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What did you write in your book? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I tried to write a practical book for the average user or manager who
wants to know what is happening, and to get some protection. As far as
possible, it is written in &quot;plain language&quot;, and tries to define
the terms clearly so that people don't have to be experts to begin with.
In fact, I stated outright in the Preface that the one group it is *not*
intended for is the virus research community. </P>

<P>I included reviews of all the virus related books I could find (plus
a couple of general security ones and some fiction). There are also a large
number of software reviews of MS-DOS antivirals, Atari antivirals and MS-DOS
general security. I am, in fact, trying to get materials together for an
updated version, and have just sent out a general call for review copies.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are the aims of your call for discussion
about viral morality? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>1) To clear the air about the confusion regarding virus exchange as
opposed to legitimate research into artificial life and &quot;good&quot;
virii.<BR>
2) To promote discussion between vx and AV people.<BR>
3) To promote discussion of computer ethics overall. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Let's make some clarifications of the terms
used in your article first. What do you mean by &quot;normal computer environment&quot;?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Mostly I mean a normal working environment, as opposed to a research
lab or other specialized situation. Fred Cohen also refers to a &quot;viral
computing environment&quot;, and sometimes I am opposing normal (Von Neumann)
architecture to the VCE. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are &quot;normal computer functions&quot;
? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Copying (Input/Output), storing, decisions based on accessible data
and predetermined programming, calculations, the basics. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You say - &quot;Operating system upgrades could
not guarantee universal coverage.&quot; What is &quot;universal coverage&quot;?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I use &quot;universal coverage&quot; here to refer to the fact that
everyone who wants the upgrade should be able to have access to it. This
does not address any concerns about copyright or payment. Since a viral
program does not have centralized distribution and control, then those
who had *not* received the upgrade could not request it from a central
location. If there was centralized control, then there is no significant
difference between this and &quot;normal&quot;, non-viral, distribution.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why do you think that the concept of reproduction
is dangerous? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Reproduction is only really dangerous in terms of filling up memory
and disk space on a given machine, so I suppose it is reproduction *and
spread* that holds the inherent danger. A program which continues to make
copies of itself, and to spread to other machines, is going to have an
unknown effect on subsequent machines/programs/systems, and that effect
is much more likely to be damaging than to be helpful. Playing with viral
programs is most akin to playing with genetic research: if it gets away
from you, you have no idea where it is going to end up or what it will
do. In fact, viral programs have a *greater* risk of running wild than
do biological organisms, since the computer &quot;ecosystem&quot; is much
simpler. Having computers &quot;get sick&quot; and crash is much less severe
than having people get sick and die, but it is demonstrably simpler to
create a computer virus than to create a viable biological organism. Logically,
therefore, every virus is potentially dangerous. </P>

<P>With the exception of &quot;system&quot; and companion viral programs
(and I only except them because I haven't thoroughly studied them), every
known viral program &quot;in the wild&quot; creates some kind of problem
for the normal, average, everyday computer environment. Historically and
statistically, therefore, every virus released into the wild has been actually
dangerous. </P>

<P>These considerations are only necessary in the &quot;normal&quot; computing
environment. Research on computer viral programs is not a problem if the
research area is isolated from the &quot;real world&quot; to avoid release.
Indeed, Fred Cohen's idea of a viral computing environment is a very exciting
one, and I'd love to do some work on it. It is likely, however, that programs
from the current computing environment would not run in a VCE, and programs
meant for a VCE would not run under current architectures. That kind of
VCE *would* be inherently safe, but it isn't the type of work that seems
to be going on right now. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are the polemics about &quot;good&quot; vs
&quot;bad&quot; viruses possibly arising because of lack of good and unique
definition of computer virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Got it in one. I think this is the heart of many disagreements about
whether a &quot;good&quot; virus is possible or not. Fred Cohen, for example,
defines the terms in a way which allows a lot of theory to be developed
and looked at with the tools of logic and number theory. It does not, however,translate
well into the &quot;real world&quot;. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you mean by &quot;real world&quot;?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The world inhabited by real computers and the average &quot;Joe (or
Jane) User&quot;, who doesn't really care about Turing machines, but *does*
care about getting this report done by five o'clock. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you define computer virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My definition, which is not accepted by everyone, is that a computer
virus is a program which is written (intended) to copy and spread itself
(to other systems) without the knowing (informed) assistance of the user.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you define worm and what relation do
you see between the two? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I accept the definition of a worm as a reproductive/parasitic program
which spreads without specifically attaching or associating itself with
a given program, particularly over networks and/or mail links. However,
I see this as a distinction without a difference. By my definition, a worm
is a specialized type of virus. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think are the basic &quot;technical&quot;
reasons against virus writing? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In brief:<BR>
a) virus writing is a simplistic task that does not contribute to learning
about computers *or* artificial life,<BR>
b) the overwhelming majority of current viral programs are malign, either
by design or stupidity. The second reason applies only to writing and release:
if you write a virus and keep it under control only the pointlessness reason
applies. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think that is possible to obtain absolute
controllability of anything? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. But I'm not a fatalist. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Assuming that major population of computer
viruses is PC/DOS population, do you think that this fact says possibly
something about inherent (technical) weaknesses of such a configuration?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Actually, while I agree that PCs have weak security, viral programs
can spread on *any* platform: they don't use any special functions. Fred
Cohen did work on several platforms. Also, David Chess [ from IBM Watson
Research Center ] has an interesting take on this: he says that the PC
platform is *very* secure - you have to convince the owner/user to run
a program of yours or a subsequent generation, and that tactic has worked
very well. In addition, I think the number of viral programs has more to
do with the number of machines available, rather than any inherent strength
or weakness of the platform. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are worms (or breaking techniques) pointing
to the vulnerabilities in today distributed systems? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Generally, no. Everyone in data security knows that the *major* weaknesses
are bad passwords and social engineering. Again, I don't think that viral
programs have anything additional to point out here. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your idea of a good testing of anti-virus
software? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I test every package of antiviral software as a whole, and as it would
appear to the naive (novice and uninformed) user. This is because, while
most computer users have heard of a computer virus, the majority do *not*
have a realistic idea of what a virus is or how it works. Almost every
article on viral programs which I have seen in the news media has presented
an inaccurate and warped view, so it is important to assess not only how
many viral variants an antiviral product can identify, but in what the
documentation says, and how well the installation procedure protects against
a possible pre-existing infection. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your opinion about exchange/sale of
(&quot;malicious&quot; PC/DOS) virus collections to legitimate evaluators/evaluating
centers/producers of antiviral products or researchers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am interpreting your question as referring to virus writing and exchange
(vx) groups and individuals offering their viral programs for sale, or
for trade in exchange for other code which they don't have, to av developers,
researchers or evaluators. As a reviewer, I would not buy such code or
make such trades. I am providing a service, at my own expense and to my
own cost, and I simply could not afford to pay money for the garbage that
most such offers are made on. I would not provide virus code to anyone
who I was not absolutely certain would keep it to themselves, or to other
like minded AV researchers. Those who produce the best antiviral software
hold similar opinions, and the argument that they &quot;benefit&quot; from
the activities of vx groups is utter nonsense. There are a number of companies
who do &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;give rewards for&quot; antiviral code.
I find their activities to be shameful, their products to be mediocre at
best, and I would not provide them with any viral code from my own collection,
pitiful as it is. </P>

<P>I am speaking of the situation as it currently exists. The discussion
of the possibility of &quot;good&quot; viral programs or artificial life
is not at issue here since current vx groups have not, to date, produced
anything which benefits either objective. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why people are willing to reject the concept
of beneficial viruses or artificial life in general? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>For those who are actively involved in antiviral research and development,
the issue is not so much one of professional bias, as some vxers argue,
as the daily realization that the current situation has almost nothing
to do with artificial life or &quot;good&quot; virii. Artificial life and
artificial intelligence have been studied for years, and, while we can
now get some use out of expert systems and certain graphical algorithms,
it will be a long and arduous task to create anything like real life or
intelligence. Those who are working in the virus field are simply too busy
to have time to spend in this pursuit. (Maybe if vxers would stop releasing
virii, AV people would have the time to look into it.) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Regarding ethical reasons against virus writing
do you think that is possible to suggest unique ethical model for human
behavior? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It certainly wouldn't be easy. People in this century are not used to
thinking of ethics or morality as anything other than an academic and philosophical
discussion. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Isn't it easier to concentrate to legal aspects,
e.g. to establish appropriate laws in existent legislative system(s)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Easy answers to difficult problems are almost always wrong. In general,
laws are safeguards against minor breakdowns of social morality. When the
network of social ethics does not exist, laws are useless. In any case,
the law in Canada makes virus &quot;release&quot; illegal - but that hasn't
eliminated the problem. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Isn't the question of morality of virus writing
somewhat exaggerated? After all there are more important problems in the
world - poverty, hunger, wars, drugs abuse, etc. Isn't that just another
way to avoid discussions about real (more important) problems? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>There are lots of real and important problems in the world. I have addressed
only one, because it is an area in which I have specialized knowledge.
It also touches on other problems such as that of ignorance, confused thinking,
and lack of ethical considerations in technical topics. I am not ignoring
other problems, but, as Edmound Burke said, the only thing necessary for
the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Or to put it in religious
terms (which seems to make many people so violently upset that they lose
all rationality): </P>

<P>&quot;Mortal man,&quot; [God] said, &quot;tell your people what happens
when I bring war to a land. The people of that country choose one of their
number to be a watchman. When he sees the enemy approaching, he sounds
the alarm to warn everyone. If someone hears it but pays no attention and
the enemy comes and kills him, then he is to blame for his own death. His
death is his own fault, because he paid no attention to the warning. If
he had paid attention, he could have escaped. If, however, the watchman
sees the enemy coming and does not sound the alarm, the enemy will come
and kill those sinners, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their
death.&quot;</P>
