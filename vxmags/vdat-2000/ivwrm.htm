<blockquote>
  <p> I don't want the feds to get this kind of info if I give u e-mail- even

<blockquote>
  <p> since june 1999 - when zf came out </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How did you come to the virus/worm business? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I had a period at work that I had nothing 2 do - only paper work <br>
    I was getting bored <br>
    I was surfing a lot on the web a was reading about viruses and then I decided 
    - since I gon nothing better 2 do - let's try so- that's the story ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Why are you writing viruses/worms? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> to improve my programming skills </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which goals do you have as virus-/wormwriter? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> no special goals - just to understand any new technology to such an extent 
    - that I can infect it.. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What programming-languages you are familiar with? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> asm-x86, asm motorola, c, C++, VB, Delphi </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> c </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How many viruses/worms you have written? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> just one </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How do you name your viruses/worms? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I don't AViers name them as they please </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Have you ever written a destructive payload, will 
  you ever write one? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> yes - I did - but I wasn't really think it would do such a damage </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Would you stop virus- /wormwriting if one of your 
  viruses/worms kills people (when it infects hospitals or something like that)? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> yes - absolutely ! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What would you do if one of your viruses/worms spreads 
  in a school/government? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I would rely on AViers to handle it </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you encourage destructive payloads? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> no - </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> If you don't encourage then why you have written 
  one? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I did mine - because I wasn't really aware of the possible dammage and I 
    didn't mean to spread it </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Have you ever considered to write a GOOD virus/worm 
  (something with useful tools for the infected person)? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> yes - I have some ideas already </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you think that it 'd be a bad idea to write something 
  like this? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> no - it could be as much challenge as ordinay virii </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Who in your real life knows that you are writing 
  viruses/worms? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> just my wife </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What does she think about your 'hobby'? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> she told me never 2 do it again.. <br>
    she thinks I risk our future needlessly </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you think virus/worm writing should be illegal? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> nop - I believe any one should have the freedom to hit his keyboard in any 
    sequence he wishes ... <br>
    it's not his fault that there r exploits </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Will you continue writing viruses/worms? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> yes - but I don't think I'll spread <br>
    I'll give it to collectors - and they'll do as they wish </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Are you member of a VX-group at the moment? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> yes - <a href="groups2.htm#SHADOW">TSVG</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think about the 'battle' between VX and 
  AV? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> this is a false battle - AV need VX to make a living </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Did/Will you ever put a virus/worm 'into the wild'? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I did ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What was it's name?? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Zipped_Files </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think about Lamers? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I thing they r the lowest creatures <br>
    I think they do it to impress </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think about VCLs (Virus-Creation-Labs)? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I think they're kewl <br>
    I don'y know exactly why... <br>
    I believe virri writers play a big role in the AV scene that if there were 
    not enough virii coders AV would have opened their own VCLs and I'm not sure 
    thy're not doing it already there is big money in AV - but u need VX for that 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you have any greets or last word? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> I'd like to thank all the ppl whom without I wouldn't be here today... especially 
    to MS - who contributed wonderfull exploits and holes to work with ! <br>
    one last thing to our readers: don't ever forget to do a backup - at least 
    once a week... <br>
    and another piece of info: zf wasn't finished when it got out - <br>
    the following features were planned and were missing: <br>
    NT Bcakup tape erasure - code was done - but was not integrated <br>
    a veriety of mail messages - not just the known one <br>
    a veriety of attachment names - not just "zipped_files.exe" </p>
