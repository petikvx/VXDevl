<P>Many people know the name Vesselin Bontchev from discussions on Virus-L/
comp.virus. His formal biography says: </P>

<P>In 1988 Mr Bontchev became interested in computer viruses and soon afterwards
his freeware anti-virus programs were the most popular in Bulgaria. In
1990 he became the director of the Laboratory of Computer Virology at the
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - a laboratory, created mainly due to his
efforts. Since 1991 he is working on his Ph.D. thesis in the Virus Test
Center at the University of Hamburg, Germany. </P>

<P>Since 1990 Mr Bontchev is the Bulgarian representative in IFIP's TC-11
(Computer Security). He is also a founding member of CARO (the Computer
Anti-virus Researchers' Organization), a founding member of VSI (the Virus
Security Institute), and a member of EICAR (the European Institute for
Computer Anti-virus research). </P>

<P>Mr Bontchev's main fields of interest include computer viruses, computer
security, integrity and data protection, encryption, number theory....etc.
</P>

<P>Leaving formalities for a moment, Vesselin Bontchev speaks for &quot;Alive&quot;
exclusively: </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you get interested in computer viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Initially - because they are interesting, of course. I mean, they are
challenging; doing something that is unusual and clever. Later I discovered
that my knowledge in this field can help many other people and this motivated
me additionally. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When did you start to deal with computer viruses
and could you describe shortly your work? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It all began in the Spring of 1988. At that time I was working on a
voluntary basis as a consultant for the only Bulgarian computer-related
magazine - &quot;Komputar za vas&quot; (&quot;Computer for You&quot;).
I was asked to provide some help in translating a German article (from
the German magazine &quot;CHIP&quot;, I believe) about computer viruses.
I didn't know German at all, but I knew a lot about computers. The article
was initially translated by a professional translator, who knew German
perfectly, but knew nothing about computers and the special jargon used
in this area. There was a lot of funny stuff in the draft translation...
But I digress. </P>

<P>In short, the article was about computer viruses. I read it, and the
subject captivated me at once. Knowing from personal experience that the
quality of the information obtained from such sources as popular magazines
tends to be rather low, I used the information system of the Bulgarian
Central Institute for Scientific and Technical Information to do a library
search by keywords and then to read all available serious journals that
had some articles on this subject. The most valuable source of information
proved to be &quot;Computers &amp; Security&quot;, and in particular the
papers from Dr. Fred Cohen and Prof. Harold Highland - two of the very
few people that seemed to know what they were talking about. </P>

<P>After reading all that was available to me at that time (not that much;
there weren't so many articles published on this subject at that time),
I decided that while an interesting mental exercise, computer viruses couldn't
be that dangerous, because every moderately competent computer techie should
be able to spot them at once. Also, it was obvious that all the hype in
the popular media was caused mostly by people who knew near to nothing
on the subject. Even the viruses that existed at that time didn't seem
anything particularly clever - I remember that when I read the description
of Brain, I spent long time wondering what the *other* part of the code
could do, because it was clear to me that anybody with some experience
in assembly language programming could fit the described functionality
into less than one kilobyte of code - so what were the other 2 Kb of the
virus *doing*? </P>

<P>In short, I wrote an article for &quot;Komputar za vas&quot;, explaining
my view that computer viruses can't be a real threat. What I have overlooked
was that by far not all computer users are technical experts who know by
heart the internals of their machines... Just a couple of days after my
article was published, two guys came at the editor's office of the magazine
and proudly announced that they have found a virus! It was what we are
calling now Vienna.648.Reboot.A, but nobody knew it at that time. The two
guys had already dealt with the infection in the company they were working
for (they were system programmers, after all) and demonstrated us how well
their custom-made disinfector works... disinfecting the only copy of the
virus left in their disposition. Of course, I wanted to examine &quot;the
beast&quot; and to understand how exactly it works and why. The problem
was, it was already gone! I visited the office in their company, and after
a long and fruitless search for an infected file, we finally found a piece
of paper in the trash bin, that contained the hex dump of an infected file...
I got that piece of paper and entered the code with DEBUG byte-by-byte.
Then I disassembled it, understood it, wrote my own disinfector (and even
a vaccine) for it... This is how it all began for me. My second case was
Cascade, then Ping_Pong, then the Bulgarian viruses began to appear (Old_Yankee,
Yankee_Doodle), and then came the Dark Avenger... </P>

<P>My work now? Well, I am working in the Virus Test Center at the University
of Hamburg, under the leadership of Prof. Klaus Brunnstein. I am in charge
of maintaining our virus collection. I am also analysing viruses, helping
people who are asking virus-related questions from all parts of the world,
writing my Ph.D. thesis, testing anti-virus products, and many other less
exciting things. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you leave Bulgarian anti-virus scene
and moved to Germany? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Because I was proposed the wonderful opportunity to live and work under
excellent working conditions in place with a very high reputation in the
computer anti-virus field - and also to get a Ph.D. there. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you familiar with present virus/anti-virus
situation in Bulgaria? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It depends on your definition of &quot;familiar&quot;. I have a pretty
clear idea of what is happening there, although I am not as much familiar
with the virus/anti-virus scene there as I used to be. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">It is known that certain animosity existed
between you and Bulgarian virus writer known as Dark Avenger some time
ago. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>That is put very mildly, yes. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about him today? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The same bad things I've been always thinking about him. Sorry, but
my education does not allow me to list them here. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your general opinion about virus writers?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Most of them are just irresponsible juvenile people (I am tempted to
say - kids), who want to &quot;establish&quot; themselves and to impress
their peers, by doing things that they perfectly know are regarded as &quot;bad&quot;
by the society, but for which, as they also know very well, this same society
is unlikely to be able to punish them. They like so much to brag about
their &quot;exploits&quot; and &quot;civil liberties&quot;, but it is actually
the same old graffiti writing, only in a more modern, electronical form.
In short - vandals. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about beneficial viruses
and artificial life? Why are people willing to reject the concept of beneficial
viruses and artificial life in general? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't feel competent to comment about artificial life, because I am
not expert in this area. I don't believe that computer viruses are a form
of artificial life, however. </P>

<P>People don't like to even hear about the so-called &quot;beneficial
viruses&quot; mostly because the term &quot;computer virus&quot; is already
loaded with negative meaning in the public opinion - maybe incorrectly,
just like the term &quot;hacker&quot;, but that's it how it is. I would
suggest to anybody who is doing serious and responsible research in the
field of self-replicating code, to use some other term, if they don't want
to be misunderstood by the general public. After all, what Dr. Cohen is
understanding under the term &quot;beneficial virus&quot; is *very* different
from those nasty little programs that the general public is acquainted
with. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think that is unethical to claim that
computer viruses can be beneficial and why? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Now, that's a difficult question... Well, it depends. It depends on
what are the motives of the person making the claim. Is he a legitimate
scientist who is trying to use an interesting phenomenon for something
useful for the humanity? Or is he just an irresponsible person who is looking
for an excuse for his asocial acts and is trying to masquerade them under
the scientifically-looking term &quot;research&quot;? </P>

<P>However, I think that even the legitimate researcher ought to emphasize
that he is talking about something completely different from the real computer
viruses known to the general public - in order not to be misunderstood.
Also, I think that he should clearly (and loudly) distinguish himself from
the virus writing crowd. Research - yes, but seriously done, in clear and
strictly controlled environment, by people who have the knowledge and experience
to conduct it. Just like the kind of research into biological experiments.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You often mention &quot;real viruses&quot;.
What are they and how are they related to the concept of &quot;beneficial
viruses&quot; ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am convinced that what most people understand under the term &quot;computer
virus&quot; cannot be beneficial. When the average user hears the term
&quot;computer virus&quot;, he almost certainly does not have a valid definition
for it, but just as certainly he has a pretty clear view of what the term
is about. I call this a &quot;real computer virus&quot;. Real computer
viruses are always bad. </P>

<P>My professional understanding of &quot;real virus&quot; is this: </P>

<P>&quot;Something has entered my computer without my authorization and
is replicating there, potentially doing damage.&quot; </P>

<P>The accents are on (a) entered without authorization, (b) replicating
- i.e. modifying executable objects and wasting time and disk space, and
(c) maybe it is doing damage, maybe it is intentionally, maybe not intentionally.
</P>

<P>The average user's understanding of &quot;real virus&quot; is probably:
</P>

<P>&quot;Something is here, I didn't allow it to be here. I've been told
it can spread like living being and that it can destroy my data/programs.
I don't like it.&quot; </P>

<P>Two years ago I asked the net to send me the arguments why they think
a &quot;good&quot; virus is a bad idea. I have collected dozen reasons.
I do not claim that computer viruses cannot be beneficial, but any virus
that pretends to have this property must not violate any of the 12 conditions.
