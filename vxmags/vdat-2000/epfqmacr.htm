<P><B>OBJECTIVE</B>: This FAQ will explain the WORD MACRO VIRUS family
of viruses, and will explain how infections occur. It will also when possible,
detail how to clean them up, and how to prevent infections in the first
place. </P>

<P>Before we get to the details, here is some info regarding the terms
I have chosen to use in this FAQ. </P>

<P>Vx or VX refers to the Virus Writing Community at large, regardless
of any individuals virus writing experience, or popularity. </P>

<P>AV refers to the Anti-Virus Community, including Researchers, Hobbyists,
and Software/Hardware Developers. </P>

<P>GUI refers to Graphical User Interface. &lt;ex. Windows 3.1&gt; </P>

<P>MAC refers to Apple MacIntosh Computers, usually both the Current POWER
PC MAC&lt;PPC&gt; and the earlier models. &lt;unless otherwise stated&gt;
</P>

<P>MS refers to MicroSoft Corporation, and products made by them. </P>

<P>PC refers to IBM Brand Computers running on the x86 &lt;including early
x88, AT, XT models&gt; series of processors produced by INTeL, AMD, NeXTGEN,
and CYRIX, as well as IBM Clone or Compatible computers. </P>

<P>OS, or Operating System, will refer to the Disk Operating Systems that
handle basic I/O, file management, etc. MS-DOS, PC-DOS, DR-DOS, DIP-DOS,
Tandy DOS, COMPAQ-DOS all fit into this category. Operating Systems with
GUI's like WINDOWS NT, OS/2 WARP, MacOS, AMIGADos, and WINDOWS '95 also
fit this category. &lt;it could be argued that WINDOWS '95 is NOT AN OS,
as an enhanced version of the classic MS-DOS OS is loaded prior to the
loading of WINDOWS Environment.&gt; </P>

<P>Operating Environments, refers to interfaces that run on top of NON-GUI
OS's such as Windows 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, Windows for Workgroups, early OS/2
versions prior to WARP. </P>

<P>Operating Platform, refers to the combination of Computer Architecture,
OS, and sometimes GUI. Examples of Platforms can include, but are not limited
to the following... </P>

<PRE>       x86 PC's running DOS
       x86 PC's running either DOS/Windows 3.0 - 3.11 &lt;most popular&gt;
       x86 PC's running DOS/OS/2 2.x or lower
       x386 PC's running DOS/Windows For WorkGroups 3.1 - 3.11
       X386 PC's running Windows NT 3.5
       X386 PC's running Windows '95
       x86 PC's running OS/2 Warp
       Apple Macs running MacOS &lt;system x-7.5&gt;
       POWERMacs running MacOS
       Alpha's running NT
</PRE>

<P>When Possible, distinctions between PC and MAC centric issues will be
made, but be forewarned this document is PC heavy. </P>

<P>NOTE: Use of VIRII as a plural of VIRUS has been dropped from this FAQ.
The term VIRUSES will be used instead. Complaints can be forwarded to ALT.COMP.VIRUS
where someone will be glad to argue with you till they're blue in the face!
:) </P>

<P>WARNING: User definable virus search strings are littered thoughout
this document. They will help users with older version of Anti-Virus software.
However, we suggest that you should acquire up-dated copies of the AV software,
which will have these strings included, and save you some trouble. Also
note that using TOOL/MACRO as a way of hunting down macro infections can
be dangerous. It is preferred that you use dedicated AV software to hunt
down infection. </P>

<P><A NAME="intro"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>INTRODUCTION: </FONT></B></P>

<P>During the last year, we have witnessed the birth of a whole new type
of virus, the WORD 6.0 MACRO VIRUS. The opening statement isn't entirely
true, as the idea of MACRO viruses isn't a new one, but this is the first
time that a macro virus has spread to the point of being considered &quot;IN
THE WILD&quot; by the Anti-Virus Community. </P>

<P>It is possibly the first Virus to be truly a CROSS-PLATFORM &lt;not
including WORMS&gt; infector, since any systems running compatible copies
of WORD 6.0, or those systems that emulate Word 6.0's macro language can
be infected. </P>

<P>It is also the first group of viruses that prove NON-Executables can
infect systems. It had been theorized for years by the best in the industry,
as people started to realize the power of the MACRO Languages that were
included with program like 1-2-3, Excel, and numerous Word-Processors.
</P>

<P>It is far less important to classify these viruses as data or executable
code or both, than to acknowledge their existence, and the need for preventive
measures against them. </P>

<P>To better understand the issues covered in this FAQ, the WORD MACRO
VIRUSES, it's necessary to first explain what a virus and a macro is. </P>

<P><A NAME="1.0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 1: WHAT IS A MACRO? WHAT IS
A WORD MACRO? </FONT></B></P>

<P>It is best to first describe what a Macro is. A macro is a collection
of instructions to be carried out by a program or computer. These instructions,
typically handle tasks that are boring, awkward, and tedious in nature.
</P>

<P>Dos users have been using a macro language for years to automate the
mundane and repetitive tasks common to maintaining a computer system. Commonly
known as the BATCH Language. In DOS, Files with the .BAT extension are
interpreted &lt;by the Command Processor COMMAND.COM&gt; and are executed
line by line, automating tasks &lt;the most common example of a batch file
is the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, found in the root directory on every MS DOS based
PC in the world&gt;. </P>

<P>NDOS &amp; 4DOS Users have their own enhanced version of the batch languages
&lt;files with the extensions .BTM&gt;, which allows the same batch files,
with additional commands, to be read by the NDOS or 4DOS command interpreters
&lt;NDOS.COM &amp; 4DOS.COM&gt; as a whole file into memory for execution
&lt;which increases the speed of the batch file&gt;. </P>

<P>OS/2 Users have enjoyed an even better Macro Language, the REXX batch/Programming
language. It is much more robust, and better suited to deal with demanding
tasks. </P>

<P>WORD MACROS, are Macros that can carry out and follow lists of instructions,
usually saving a user keystrokes. The abilities of the WORD MACROS are
limited to the functions provided by the MS WORD WordBasic Environment,
included with the WORD 6.x level of Word Processors from MicroSoft. NOTE:
WordBasic included with WORD 1.x, 2.x have enought similar commands in
their languages to warrant consideration. </P>

<P>Imagine having to add your name, address, phone#, and other personal
info to dozens of documents daily, it would become tedious fast. Macros
can automate the process, saving alot of time and effort. The power of
the WordBasic Macro Environment gives the users, both home users and business
users alike the ability to automate many tasks, including file management,
from within MS WORD. Macros also include the ability to affect other running
applications, via the Word Macro language, by DDE etc. Unknown to the author
at this time, it's been theorized that OLE abiltiy may also exist in the
WORDBASIC macro Language. &lt;BOTH DDE and OLE may be entry point for future
viruses&gt; </P>

<P>MS WORD MACROS are only executable by the WORDBasic environment, which
is limited to functional copies of MS WORD 6.x /7.x and sometimes 2.0,
as well as WORDVIEW 7.1. For the sake of this FAQ, MACROS will be considered
Data files. Macros require interpretation by the WordBasic Environment,
and are not executed in the classic DOS sense. Executables will be defined
as files that follow the classic standards, including EXE, COM, NEWEXE,
BAT &lt;yes they are interpreted, but they are also almost always DIRECTLY
executed by the user, and as such almost fall into the same GREY area that
these macro viruses fall into&gt; as well as the programs in the boot-sector,
master boot sectors. It could be argued that WORD macro are a combination
or data and executable code. A notable exception to the batch file rule,
is the WINSTART.BAT file, which Windows 3.11 for WorkGroups looks for in
every directory in the path, and tries to execute. It'll be executed whether
the user wishes it to be or not. </P>

<P>NOTE: David Harley &lt;harley@europa.lif.icnet.uk&gt; and Joseph Stafford
(stafford@twsuvm.uc.twsu.edu) have noted that MicroSoft Word Wizards are
also WORD Macros. Wizards are simply templates with the WIZ extension,
which include an AutoNew Macro, which call a Start Wizard Macro. WIZ files
may soon fall prey to macro infections. </P>

<P><A NAME="1.1"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 1.1: WHAT IS A VIRUS? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A computer VIRUS, is a &lt;usually compiled&gt; computer program, that
is able to replicate in whole or part it's code, by infecting or modifying
other programs, and adding to or overwriting the code of uninfected files
with code &lt;possibly evolved or unique forms of the infector&gt; that
will in turn infect other programs. Viruses must be able to replicate.
A Virus that is unable to replicate isn't technically a virus. &lt;by our
definition&gt; </P>

<P>NOTE: Viruses can and sometimes do infect files indirectly, without
altering the CODE of executable files. For instance, File System or Cluster
viruses ( Dir-II, BYWay ) are those which alter directory entries, pointing
a legitimate directory entry first to it's malicious code, so the virus
can be executed, and then the desired program is executed. The program
itself is not physically altered, but the directory entry is. </P>

<P>Viruses may, and often do have destructive bombs or payloads, which
do something other than replicate. Many payloads include destroying data,
deleting files, encrypting parts of hard drives, etc. Common targets for
Viruses include standard Executables like *.COM, *.EXE, and NEWEXE files,
as well as the programs used by the computer to boot up, including the
programs &lt;executable code&gt; found in Boot sectors, and Master Boot
Sectors. Other DOS executables can also be infected, such as *.DLL and
*.BIN, *.DRV, *.OV? *.OB? and *.SYS files. Not all of these executable
will allow for the proper execution of viral code, and can/may either hang
the machine, crash a session, or simply not function, producing numerous
errors. Common examples of executable files include COMMAND.COM, EMM386.EXE,
Windows Executables, MOUSE.DRV, DRVSPACE.BIN, and HIMEM.SYS. &lt;everyone
with Modern release of MS-DOS and WINDOWS should recognize these files&gt;
</P>

<P>A sub-class of viruses, known as Trojan Horses, are commonly, and possibly
incorrectly considered viruses. A Trojan Horse, named after the Greek Battle
Tactic, is a program, that is stated and promoted as being able to do something
useful or interesting &lt;like a game or utility&gt;, but in turn does
something malicious.&lt;like drop a virus for later infection&gt; Trojans
typically DO NOT ACTIVELY REPLICATE. They may inadvertently get copied
around and distributed, but this has little or nothing to do with any replication
code in the TROJAN. </P>

<P>NOTE : It can be argued that Viruses by the above definition, are Trojans.
This argument would have Viruses listed as replicating Trojans. Defining
these two groups of programs isn't really relevant, as long as you understand
the premise behind both groups. For a more detailed definition of VIRUSES,
refer to the ALT.COMP.VIRUS VIRUS FAQ, by David HARLEY, or the COMP.VIRUS/VIRUSL
FAQ's on VIRUSES. Both are an excellent source of virus related info. Both
are reposted regularly to their respective newsgroups. </P>

<P><A NAME="1.2"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 1.2: WHAT IS A MS WORD MACRO
VIRUS? </FONT></B></P>

<P>An MS WORD MACRO Virus, is a macro &lt;list of instructions&gt; or template
file &lt;usually with the .DOT extension&gt; which masquerades as legitimate
MS WORD documents &lt;usually with the extension *.DOC&gt;. An infected
*.DOC file, doesn't look any different to the average PC user, as it can
still contain a normal document. The difference is that this document is
really just a template or macro file, with instructions to replicate, and
possibly cause damage. MS WORD will interpret the *.DOT macro/template
file regardless of extension, as a template file. This allows for it being
passed off as a legitimate document &lt;*.DOC&gt; This FAQ takes the position
that a document is meant to be DATA, and a MACRO is at least partially
executable CODE. When a document has been infected, it has been merged
with executable code in a multi-part file, part data/part executable. This
tends to be hidden from the user, who expects a document to be data that
is READ, and not some combination of DATA and executable code designed
to be executed, often against the will of the user, to wreck havok. </P>

<P>These viruses commonly tend to infected the global macros, which get
automatically saved at the end of each session. When the next session of
MS WORD opens, the infected Global Macros are executed, and the WORD Environment
is now infected, and will in turn be likely to infect documents whenever
they are opened, closed, and created during all future sessions. </P>

<P>As a Virus, the WORD MACRO VIRUSES do REPLICATE. They can spread in
most cases to any MS WINDOWS Environment or OS that runs a compatible copy
of MS WORD 6.x or 7.x, MS WORD 6.x running on OS/2, as well as WORD for
MAC 6.0 for MacOS. This makes it a multi-platform/multi-OS file infector.
It also makes it one of the first non-research viruses to be successfully
spread to all of these environments and OS's </P>

<P>MS Word Macro Viruses reside in interpreted data that can spread to
different OS's/platforms. These viruses do not spread via modification
of executable machine code, but by modification of data in files that are
interpreted by the Microsoft Word 6.0 program and any other versions of
Word that support macros and WordBasic. </P>

<P>MacIntosh Word Users have an advantage over the PC world, as infected
documents appear with the template icon, rather than the usual document
icon. This means that Mac Users can visually tell before-hand whether a
Document is infected or not. </P>

<P>For responsible Word 6.x users, Macros can also be of great use. The
Macro Language of WORD 6.x &lt;WORD BASIC&gt; is a powerful tool, and can
accomplish many tasks, including altering files, copying files, and executing
other programs. What makes this macro language so powerful is also what
makes it a target for the Vx community. The idea of the Vx community exploiting
macro languages had been theorized for years, but has only recently been
developed and spread throughout the world. </P>

<P>WordBasic Macro Language is much simpler to learn and master than ASSEMBLER,
or other popular higher Level programming languages, and for this reason,
Vx people &lt;both new and old alike&gt; have taken to it as a viable alternative
to learning and coding ASM . The thought of ticking users off on more than
one platform has been around for years, and now thanks to MS WORD, and
all it's compatible versions on other popular platforms, the Vx people
have their wish. Another Bonus of this new outlet for Vx writers, is that
many virus scanners only scan Executable files, leaving the .DOC files
of WORD alone. It is important to note that many AV producers have now
included scanners/cleaners to their software, allowing for the detection
of existing MS WORD Macro Viruses. </P>

<P>Vx people also know that many people never exchange programs, but regularly
exchange documents &lt;those in the corporate circles for example&gt; which
meant that there was a whole new region of unsuspecting users to infect.
On top of the power and lower learning curve of this language, and the
popular past conception that non-executables are relatively safe from infection
and becoming themselves infectors has allowed the Word Macro Virus spread
like &quot;Wildfire&quot;. &lt; Editor smiles :) &gt; </P>

<P>Even until just recently, members of the respected AV community inadvertently
continues these classic misconceptions that NON-executables &lt;DATA FILES&gt;
cannot infect systems, and that no VIRUS can infect on a CROSS-PLATFORM
basis. F-PROT V2.21 &lt;Dec '95&gt; continues these misconceptions in the
file VIRUS.DOC, included with their DOS command line scanner... </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;A virus cannot spread from one type of computer to another. For
example, a virus designed to infect Macintosh computers cannot infect PCs
or vice versa.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;A virus cannot infect a computer unless it is booted from an infected
diskette or an infected program is run on it. Reading data from an infected
diskette cannot cause an infection.&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P>This isn't meant to be a knock on F-PROT... they easily have one of
the best virus scanners on the market. They're just too busy keeping us
VIRUS-FREE that they simply haven't gotten around to updating this older
file! :) &lt;Info on obtaining a copy of F-PROT is included in the SUGGESTED
SOFTWARE area of this FAQ.&gt; </P>

<P>Heck, a year ago, those two quotes were standard replies to virus related
questions regarding how viruses spread, and at the time you'd be hard-pressed
to prove these quotes wrong. Now, the new realities are setting in. The
MS WORD Macro Virus Family have changed the rules. Infection from simply
reading a document is NOW possible. </P>

<P>So, a WORD MACRO Virus, is a collection of instructions, known as a
macro or template which WinWord &lt;Word 6.x&gt; executes. The list of
instructions in the macro can copy and delete files, alter them, make whole
changes to template files, drop other viruses, and execute programs, including
ones it has dropped. These Macro Viruses &lt;as defined in section 1&gt;
aren't directly executable. They are actually read &lt;and interpreted
and executed&gt; by the MS WORD WordBasic Interpreter. This is the first
time a virus infection has occurred in the mainstream user market where
a file was only read &lt;or at least the user thought was only going to
be read&gt; for it to be executed. </P>

<P>MSN - MicroSoft Network, and other similar ON-LINE services, have also
contributed to the spread of Word Macro Viruses, via a feature included
in their terminal programs, MIME-compliant mailers (e.g., Eudora). and
WWW browsers (e.g., Mosaic and Netscape). This features, allows users to
download and view .DOC files while on-line... the terminals can run the
associated program for .DOC files, &lt;MS WORD&gt; and therefore immediately
infect users systems. This mechanism WILL also allow the virus to be introduced
into your system via mail or a WWW page. Use such automatic execution with
caution. Had the Macro Viruses never been created, this feature would be
of benefit. </P>

<P>NOTE: Reading Infected documents with anything other than a copy of
MS WORD will not activate and spread the infection. For the virus to become
active, MS WORD is required, and it must be WORD that is used to view the
document. For example, NORTON UTILITIES Norton Commander &lt;DOS&gt; has
a document viewer, able to view 10-12 of the most popular formats for documents,
including various versions of WORKS, WORD and WordPerfect documents. Using
the viewer to read an infected document, and telling it to use WORD 6.x
format, will allow you to view the document, but will NOT and CAN NOT execute
any macros. </P>

<P>At the time of this writing, it was mentioned to me that MicroSoft had
released a WORD Document Viewer, that does not execute Macros, that could
be used in place of WORD for the purpose of viewing Documents while on-line.
MSN or it's affiliated BBS services should have the file available for
download. </P>

<P>UPDATE: Eric Phelps noted that a newer version to the WORD Viewer is
now available from MS, called WordView 7.1. Unlike it's predecessor, it
will execute some MACROS. Users who uses the Veiwer to prevent macro infection,
should stick to the previous version. This WordView 7.1 doesn't have a
NORMAL.DOt to infect, but it still allows for an entry point into your
system. Use WordView 7.1 with caution. </P>

<P><A NAME="2.0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 2: HOW DOES INFECTION OCCUR?
</FONT></B></P>

<P>Typically, a MACRO infection occurs when an infected macro instructs
the system to overwrite or alter existing system macros with infected ones,
by adding to or altering macros in the GLOBAL MACRO list, which in turn
tend to infect all documents opened and written thereafter. </P>

<P>When Word opens a document &lt;.DOC&gt;, it first looks for all included
macros in it. This is alittle misleading... MS WORD looks at the DOC, first
thinking it is a DOC, but finds that it has TEMPLATE/MACRO code &lt;meaning
it isn't technically a document, but a template file&gt; If it finds the
AutoOpen Macro, or other AUTO macros, Word will automatically execute this
macro. Typically, in the case of an infected .DOC file, this macro will
instruct the system to infect important key macros and template files.
Those Macros will in turn infect any documents opened thereafter. &lt;hence
the Term VIRUS&gt; </P>

<P>Typically, the FileSaveAs Macro is replaced or overwritten, so that
an infected copy can then determine how all future documents will be saved.
This means it gains the control of what file format to save in, and what
macros to include into the document. All this is seamless, and most of
the time you may not even realize this is happening. When the user executes
the FileSaveAs command, the virus (e.g., Concept) displays the *usual*
dialog box, letting the user fill in the fields for the file name, location,
type, etc. Onl *afterwards* the virus changes the type of the file to template
- so the user doesn't see anything unusual. AutoOpen and other Macros are
then included into documents. When exchanging documents with uninfected
computers, the system becomes instantly infected as soon you try to view
and load the infected document &lt;macro/template&gt; with a compatible
copy of MS WORD! </P>

<P>At the end of a WORD session, MS Word automatically saves all Global
Macros into the Global Macro File, typically the Normal.DOT file. Now all
future sessions of Word will infect documents it opens until you replace
NORMAL.DOT with an uninfected copy. &lt;or delete the infected macros&gt;
Otherwise, MS Word Loads, and will load infected GLOBAL MACROS before you
do a single thing. NOTE: Some macros will save to the Global macros on
their own! </P>

<P><A NAME="3.0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 3: KNOWN FEATURES AND LIMITATIONS
OF THE WINWORD FAMILY OF VIRUSES </FONT></B></P>

<P>Common features of this family of viruses include the inability to save
an infected document in any format other than Word Template Format, the
documents are converted into Template format &lt;used internally in Word,
and by the user&gt;, and tends to disallow saving of file/document in any
other directory using the SAVE AS command&lt;You can save the infected
document anywhere you want - when it is first infected. Only if you *load*
an *already infected* document, and *then* try to use the FileSaveAs command
on it, will Word try to force you to save it in the template directory
- because it is now a template; not a simple document.&gt;. Most WORD MACRO
VIRUSES and TROJANS to DATE only affect ENGLISH ONLY Copies. Some exceptions
apply. In Nationalized copies of WORD, the macro language commands have
been translated to the national language, therefore macros created with
the English version of Word will not work. &lt;makes perfect sense to me...
anyone know how AutoOpen is spelled in French? :) &gt; </P>

<P>[ according to Vesselin Bontchev &lt;bontchev@complex.is&gt; The auto
macros are always spelled in one and the same way in al nationalized versions.
It is things like FileSaveAs that are translated ]. </P>

<P>NOTE: PC Users will likely not notice the difference between a TEMPLATE
infected file masquerading around as a document file, as word will recognize
Macro Templates in a file regardless of the extension used by the Template
&lt;Default *.DOT&gt;. &lt;Send Complaints to BILL GATES, C/O MICROSOFT
CORP.&gt; MacIntosh Users can visually tell whether a Document is infected
or by, since infected documents appear with the template/macro icon, instead
of the normal document icon. A file that is indicated by a template icon
may simply be a harmless template, that the user has made, containing legitimate
macros. This MAC advantage will depend on how the document is opened. Opening
with the File / Open command will not help a MAC user make the distinction.
Viewing parameters for a folder will also determine whether a MAC user
will notice the template file. Viewing by size, name, or date will not
help, as the icon isn't displayed properly. </P>

<P>A Feature common to most viruses of this type is the ability to spread
to other platforms, making this family of viruses unique, and dangerous.
They can and will spread to almost any platform operating with a compatible
copy of MS Word 6.x+. &lt;some exceptions apply&gt; </P>

<P>Although other word processors like WordPerfect and Ami Pro do support
reading MS Word documents, they can not be infected by these viruses. These
program have the ability to read documents, but not to execute the macro
language command that may be imbedded. </P>

<P>It's worth noting that macro viruses whose payloads have no effect on
a Mac (PC emulators excepted) will nevertheless replicate on the Mac unless
they use one of the relatively few WordBasic functions specific to Windows
in the infection/replication routine. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 4: VIRUS EXAMPLES </FONT></B></P>

<P>There are a number of Word Macro viruses in the wild, the first and
foremost being the CONCEPT Virus. &lt;although DMV was created first, CONCEPT
is what pushed this new breed of viruses into the wild FIRST. It was the
first to be widely recognized as a nuisance. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.1"></A><B>4.1: Concept Virus : </B></P>

<P>Also known by the Aliases of WW6Macro, WinWord.Concept, Word Basic Macro
Virus (WBMV), Word Macro 9508 &lt;MAC&gt; and Prank Macro &lt;MicroSoft
named it Prank, to downplay the seriousness of the situation&gt;. This
was the first MS Macro Virus to be detected by the Anti-Virus community,
and the first Macro Virus to be considered in the wild, with infections
spreading to the US, UK, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Canada, the Netherlands,
Turkey, and Finland, and other Countries. </P>

<P>The proliferation of this virus is widespread, mainly due to 2 companies
ACCIDENTLY shipping this virus in infected documents found on their CD-ROMS.
The first CD-ROM was... </P>

<CENTER><P>MicroSoft Windows '95 Software Compatibility Test </P></CENTER>

<P>which was shipped to thousands of OEM companies in mid 1995. In August/September
Microsoft distributed the Concept virus on a CD-ROM in the UK called...
</P>

<CENTER><P>&quot;The Microsoft Office 95 and Windows 95 Business Guide&quot;
</P></CENTER>

<P>The infected file is \Office95\Evidence\Helpdesk.DOC, dated August 17th,
1995, &lt;121,856 bytes&gt; The third CD was... </P>

<CENTER><P>Snap-On Tools for Windows NT </P></CENTER>

<P>which was distributed by ServerWare, who immediately withdrew it, warned
recipients, and re-mastered it. MicroSoft Corp. is to be commended for
acknowledging their part in the spreading of this new virus, &lt;calling
it a PRANK&gt; and their effort in controlling the spread of it. They were
quick to respond to this new Virus threat with a Macro Scanner/Cleaner
which is available freely for download from MSN and associated services.
&lt;Note: it's buggy&gt; </P>

<P>This commendation should be taken with a grain of salt, as MicroSoft
waited up to two months before admitting there was a problem, down playing
the seriousness of the situation, and calling it a PRANK Macro, not befitting
an acknowledgment as a REAL virus in their view. MS in turn requested help
from AV insiders, and subsequently released their own flawed FIX. AV people
wanted info regarding internal information of the WORDBASIC Macro Template
Format. </P>

<P>Such help wasn't forthcoming, at least not until months later. During
the whole time that the bulk of the AV people waited for help, MS cited
their FIX as being the only thing that CAN deal with this new virus, and
that Current AV Products were useless. &lt;not the first time MS has thrown
rocks at competitors...&gt; The statement from MicroSoft is only partially
true, as a number of AV companies figured out the Macro format on their
own, and released their own fixes. Those of us who are used to dealing
with MicroSoft would agree that 5 months of waiting, being told you're
wrong, then finally getting the help you asked for was &quot;a quick response&quot;.
:) </P>

<P>A CONCEPT Infection is easy to notice, on the first execution of the
virus infected document (on the first opening of the infected file) the
MessageBox appears with digit &quot;1&quot; inside, and &quot;Ok&quot;
button. Also, simply checking the TOOLS/MACROS option to check loaded macros,
the presence of concept is apparent by the appearance of these 5 macros
: </P>

<PRE>       AAAZFS *
       AAAZAO *
       AutoOpen
       PayLoad *
       FileSaveAs
</PRE>

<P>NOTE: Using the Tools/Macro option to view in memory macros can be misleading,
and dangerous, as some viruses will intercept this call. The Tools/Macro
option should be used with caution with all viruses, and shouldn't be considered
as a genera way to look for macro viruses. The Colors virus for example
intercepts this comman and activates if it is used. </P>

<P>You may be currently using legitimate macros that go by the names of
AutoOpen and FileSaveAs, so these two may not be out of place. However,
it is unlikely that you use legitimate macros with names like Payload,
AAAZFS, and AAAZAO. These 3 are the clearest signs of an infection. </P>

<P>Note: As has been noted in some press releases, the virus code is simple
for a novice to modify, so variants may also be present or appear soon.
The Macros are UNEnencrypted, and are easily viewable. </P>

<P>The following Text strings are in the infected documents... </P>

<PRE>       see if we're already installed
       iWW6IInstance
       AAAZFS
       AAAZAO
       That's enough to prove my point
</PRE>

<P>Also, the line... </P>

<PRE>       WW6I=1
</PRE>

<P>is added to WINWORD6.INI on infected systems. </P>

<P>The Concept Virus is able to run on compatible systems running Microsoft
Word for Windows 6.x and 7.x, Word for Macintosh 6.x, as well as in Windows
95 and Windows NT environments. In Macintosh Word, infected documents appear
with the template icon, rather than the usual document icon. </P>

<P>NOTE TO WINDOWS '95/WORD '95 USERS: Those of you who are running Windows
95 and Word 95, and have Word set up to act as your Exchange mail program;
&lt;WordMail.&gt; are protected from the spreading abilities of CONCEPT,
as WORDMAIL disables the capability that lets Concept spread, so you cannot
get infected by reading mail with WordMail. However, if an incoming message
has an attached infected Word document, and you double-click on that document
to open it in Word, you will get infected. </P>

<P>F-Prot has made an Anti-Viral FIX for this ONE virus, known as WVFIX.
It detects a Concept Infection, and can make modifications to WORD settings
on PC's to prevent further re-infection by this one virus. Available now
from... </P>

<P>and... </P>

<UL>
<P>Command Software System's FTP site<BR>

</UL>

<P>and is included on F-PROT for DOS Diskettes. If you don't have F-PROT
Professional which detects this virus, you can detect it manually with
older F-PROT versions, by placing the following 2 lines into your F-PROT
USER.DEF file, found in your F-PROT for DOS Directory... </P>

<UL>
<P>CE WordMacro/Concept<BR>
646F02690D6957573649496E7374616E63650C67 </P>
</UL>

<P>then turn on the USER-DEFINED section of the Targets menu, and add *.DO?
as an extension to scan for, or scan for ALL FILES. If F-PROT finds an
infected document with this method, use WVFIX to do an additional scan
of to confirm infection, as legitimate documents may get flagged using
the above search string. </P>

<P>SOPHOS SWEEP users can add detection of this virus to their older scanners
by executing Sweep in full Mode with the following &lt;meant as one line,
but displayed below as 2...&gt; command... </P>

</UL>

<P>Users of IBM's Anti-Virus can add protection to their system for this
Virus Manually, or can acquire updated copies of AntiVirus from IBM. To
Manually add detection of CONCEPT to IBM AntiVirus add the following three
lines to an ADDENDA.LST file in the same directory as VIRSIG.LST </P>

<UL>
<P>07734D6163726F24126A0D476C6F62616C3A4141415A414F<BR>
%s the WordMacro.Concept %s<BR>
DOC and DOT (COM format) files. Mismatches=0. No fragments. </P>
</UL>

<P>Then use the &quot;Check System&quot; dialog to add &quot;*.DOT&quot;
to the list of patterns to check, or simply instruct IBM Anti-Virus to
scan ALL FILES. </P>

<P>PC Users can also acquire the Macro Virus Protection Tool. (On CompuServe
or AOL, GO MS; on Microsoft Network, GO MACROVIRUSTOOL.) Follow the instructions
to run the file. It will look for macro viruses, both among your macros,
and any documents you specify. It will also install special macros that
will help prevent any further infection. </P>

<P>If you use SCAN.DOC, make sure that your copy of the &quot;cleanall&quot;
macro is not one of the early releases which contained a typo! Look for
the line Dlg.Pat$ = &quot;*.doc;*.dot&quot; used to set up the &quot;.Name&quot;
argument for FileFind. There should be NO space between the semicolon and
the second asterisk. A space here (found in early releases) prevents looking
for &quot;.DOT&quot; files. </P>

<P>Microsoft has also made software available to counter this virus &lt;on
MACS&gt;, obtainable via the WWW from... </P>

<UL>
<P>&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/kb/softlib/mslfiles/mw1222.hqx&gt; </P>

<P>This FIX from Microsoft only renames the virus rather than removing
it. Also note that the file system scan function supplied (&quot;Scan.doc&quot;)
may not actually find every occurrence of infected files on a Macintosh.
A few others vendors of major Macintosh anti-virus software are planning
minor releases of their products to cope with this virus or help identify
its presence. </P>

<P>Note: A Personal Solution for this Virus is possible. Simply make 2
dummy macros &lt;they don't need to do anything&gt;, one as Payload, the
other as FileSaveAs. This virus checks for the presence of these macros,
and if found, DOES NOT infect your system&lt;The virus checks for the presence
of *either* of these macros, so usin just one (any) of them is sufficient&gt;.
This is a CONCEPT virus solution only, and will likely become useless with
any future variants of Concept. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.2"></A><B>4.2: Nuclear : </B></P>

<P>Known widely as Winword.Nuclear, Wordmacro-Nuclear and Wordmacro-Alert.
This virus was the first WordMacro virus to infect &lt;or at least to attempt
to infect&gt; both data/documents &lt;Word Documents .DOT and .DOC&gt;
as well as executables &lt;.COM/.EXE/NEWEXE&gt; </P>

<P>In truth, it is 2 viruses, a macro virus which alters the Operating
Environment of WORD, and an executable file infector &lt;as well as a system
file deleter&gt;. This makes NUCLEAR the first Macro Virus to also incorporate,
or at least try to incorporate a classic File Infector Virus. This virus
is actually quite ineffective in the destructive sense, detailed later
in this document. The infected documents contains the following nine Macros...
</P>

<PRE>       AutoExec
       AutoOpen
       FileSaveAs
       FilePrint
       FilePrintDefault
       InsertPayload   *
       Payload         *
       DropSuriv       *
       FileExit
</PRE>

<P>which get copied into the GLOBAL Macro List. </P>

<P>General detection of NUCLEAR is easy, simply view the macros listed
under the Macros command under the Tools Menu. If Macros &quot;InsertPayload&quot;,
&quot;Payload&quot;, and &quot;DropSuriv&quot; are listed, then you'll
likely have a NUCLEAR infection. &lt;unless you named legitimate macros
with the same names... :) &gt; NUCLEAR hides itself from detection, by
disabling the &quot;PROMPT FOR CHANGES TO NORMAL.DOT&quot; option. Changes
are made, and the user doesn't notice anything. </P>

<P>NOTE: Use of the TOOL/MACRO command can be dangerous. Some viruses subvert
this command. Use with caution. Use AV software to find and delete infected
macros. </P>

<P>The &quot;InsertPayload&quot; Macro will cause the following text to
be added to the end of printouts when printing documents. Every 12th printout
will have the following text added... </P>

<PRE>       And finally I would like to say:
       STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC!
</PRE>

<P>which is appended to the file after the command to print is issued but
prior to the actual printing. FAX's sent via a FAX Print Driver will also
be affected, this much I know first hand. From testing, I came to the realization
that some Vx putz will start messing with my outgoing faxes behind our
backs. </P>

<P>Another included Macro, is &quot;Payload&quot; which tries to delete
IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM on April 5th. It is ineffective, as WordBasic
can't reset the attributes of a file which has the System attribute set.
It has been noted that a variant that does work is being circulated. </P>

<P>The Second part of the Nuclear Virus is the executable infector. The
DropSuriv Macro checks system time, and will attempt to drop the file infector
between 17:00/18:00. However, the routine is flawed, and shouldn't work
on any system. &lt;fails due to a syntax error - not closed IF statement,
which makes this payload never executed&gt; If DropSuriv DID work properly,
it would search for the standard DOS util DEBUG.EXE, if found, the macro
drops PH33r.SCR &amp; EXEC_PH.BAT. The Bat File is executed, and then the
hex dump file PH33r.SCR is converted from a DEBUG script into an executable,
and is in turn executed. Later, the .SCR and the .BAT files are deleted
to cover its tracks. The File infector then hooks INT 21h and writes itself
at the end of COM/EXE/NewEXE files. &lt;however, the memory is released
once this DOS task is completed, includes the memory resident virus Ph33r&gt;
Unconfirmed reports state that a NUCLEAR infected Macro with a fully operational
DropSuriv Macro exist. </P>

<P>The following text strings are in the executable infector... </P>

<PRE>       =Ph33r=
       Qark/VLAD
</PRE>

<P>SOPHOS SWEEP users can use a user-defined search string to find NUCLEAR,
simple by executing the following command &lt;the following 2 lines are
actually ONE log one&gt; using Sophos' SWEEP in full mode... </P>

<UL>
<P>SWEEP C: -F -ALL<BR>
-PAT=63e6e5e5ee8fe6e3e48fefe3fd87b1c98aeaad8ca7918c93 </P>
</UL>

<P>Discovered on the internet, the discovered infected file ironically
was supposed to provide info on a previous Macro Virus, Concept. Mac Users
will notice an infected document, since infected documents appear with
the template icon, instead of the usual document icon. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.3"></A><B>4.3: Colors: </B></P>

<P>Colors, is the first WINWORD Macro Virus that could be called cute &lt;IMHO&gt;.
This Virus has the noticeable ability to alter the Windows colors settings.
Mac Word is immune to the payload &lt;the system colors attack&gt; but
is still susceptable to the infection mechanism, which will attack documents.
Detection of infections is easy, as infected documents appear with the
template icon, rather than the usual document icon. </P>

<P>Commonly known as Rainbow or WordMacro.Colors, this virus was freely
posted to usenet newsgroups on October 14th, 1995. The Colors Virus will
infect the global template &lt;usually NORMAL.DOT&gt; upon opening of an
infected document. An infected document contains the following macros:
</P>

<PRE>       AutoOpen
       AutoClose
       AutoExec
       FileNew
       FileExit
       FileSave
       FileSaveAs
       ToolsMacro, and other macros.
</PRE>

<P>All Macros included in COLORS are Execute-Only, and cannot be viewed
or edited by MicroSoft Word. If normal &quot;clean&quot; macros with the
same names existed prior to infection, they will be overwritten by COLORS.
</P>

<P>The AutoExec Macro of COLORS is an EMPTY Macro, possibly designed to
defeat any ANTI-MACRO-VIRUS schemes developed by the AV community. It accomplishes
this by overwriting a &quot;CLEANING/SCANNER&quot; AutoExec Macro with
COLORS empty one, effectively making the AV Scanner/Cleaner useless. The
Cleaner Provided by Microsoft would fall victim to this attack, and subsequently
be rendered useless. </P>

<P>COLORS will also enable AutoMacros in case you were smart and disabled
them! It will also disable the MS Word's Prompt to save changes to NORMAL.DOT.
</P>

<P>COLORS is crafty, as it can spread without the use of AUTO macros...
thus defeating the DISABLE AUTOMACROS Feature. It does so via the Macros:
</P>

<PRE>       File/New
       File/Save
       File/SaveAs
       File/Exit
       Tools/Macro
</PRE>

<P>COLORS will infect NORMAL.DOT whenever a user chooses any of the above
functions. It also has limited stealth ability, earning it the title of
being the first WINWORD STEALTH MACRO VIRUS. It accomplishes it's stealth
actions, by hiding itself from the active listing, since attempting to
view active macros would run the COLORS infected Tools/Macro, thus hiding
it's own presence while simultaneously infecting your system. However,
deleting these macros is easy, simply use the File/Templates/Organizer/Macros
to view the names of virus' macros and delete them. </P>

<P>The COLORS virus will keep track of infections via a counter, named
&quot;countersu&quot;, which can be found under the [Windows] section of
the WIN.INI file. Whenever an infected macro is executed, the counter is
incremented by a count of one. It quickly adds up, when you consider how
much you OPEN, CREATE, SAVE, EXIT, and CLOSE documents. When the increment
counter reaches 299, and every 300th execution thereafter, COLORS will
be triggered. COLORS will then make changes to the system colors setup,
including text, background, borders, buttons, etc., using randomly determined
colors. The new color scheme becomes apparent to the user during the next
session of Windows. </P>

<P>NOTE: MicroSoft Word for Macintosh is immune to this effect. In Macintosh
Word, infected documents appear with the template icon, rather than the
usual document icon, which alerts the user to this infection. Only Copies
of WORD running on a Windows OS or Windows Operating Environments will
suffer these effects. PPC Macs running emulation software that allows Windows
and Windows WORD 6.x to run could be hit by this payload. &lt;Does current
PPC MAC allow for Windows and Word to be run on it??? &gt; </P>

<P>Colors ability to spread without the use of AutoExecute Macros, and
its use of Advanced Stealth techniques signals a new level of MACRO virus
technology. &lt;Hiding itself from view when you actively look for it defines
STEALTH in my book, since it evades detection&gt; It also adds fuel to
the VxD argument, as an on access scanner could prevent infection by this
type of stealthy virus. NOTE: Check SUGGESTED SOFTWARE section for AV developers
with VxD scanners </P>

<P>F-Prot Users should note that F-PROT Professional 2.20 is not able to
detect the Colors macro virus, but you can detect it manually by following
the same method used in the CONCEPT section of this FAQ for Scanning with
F-PROT and it's user Defined Strings. In this Case, use the following 2
lines, which are to be added to your USER.DEF file. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.4"></A><B>4.4: DMV: </B></P>

<P>Commonly known as WordMacro.DMV, DMV is an unremarkable TEST Virus,
possibly the first to be created using the WORDBasic Language. Joel McNamera
wrote it in the fall of 1994, as a real time TEST for some MACRO Virus
Theories. The Virus was kept under wraps, and a detailed paper was published.
This TEST virus was only released, as an educational aid, after the CONCEPT
virus was discovered. DMV isn't a threat to anyone, as it announce itself
upon infecting the system. </P>

<P>MAC Word Users can visually detect DMV, since infected documents will
appear with the template icon, instead of the usual document icon. </P>

<P>The Writer of DMV is rumored to be playing with some EXCEL Viruses,
based on details he published about a virus that would infect MicroSoft
EXCEL Spreadsheet Files. &lt;anyone get the feeling 6 months from now I'll
be writing an EXCEL MACRO Virus FAQ ??? :) &gt; </P>

<P>[ DOES ANYONE HAVE THE PUBLISHED PAPER? ] </P>

<P><A NAME="4.5"></A><B>4.5: HOT: </B></P>

<P>Also known as WORDMACRO HOT, WinWord.Hot. </P>

<P>Not the most ingenious of the Macro Virus Family, it's biggest kick,
is the ability to wait or sleep for awhile &lt;up to 14 days&gt; and then
delete a file. WordMacro/Hot appears to be the first Word macro virus written
in Russia. It was found in the wild in Russia in January 1996. </P>

<P>Infected documents contain four execute-only macros: </P>

<PRE>        AutoOpen
        DrawBringInFrOut
        InsertPBreak
        ToolsRepaginat.
</PRE>

<P>MacIntosh Word Users will notice HOT, by examining the icon of the file...
infected documents appear with the template icon, normal documents appear
with the normal document icon. </P>

<P>NOTE: WordMacro/Hot appears to be the first macro virus to use external
functions, allowing Word macros to call any standard Windows API call.
This makes the spreading function Windows 3.x specific, preventing Word
for MAC and Word 7 for Win '95 from spreading the Virus. An error dialog
will be displayed under Microsoft Word 7.0. </P>

<UL>
<P>Unable to load specified library </P>
</UL>

<P>HOT activates automatically via it's AutoOpen Macro &lt;assuming no
attempt to disable AutoMacros has been made&gt; adding a line LIKE... </P>

<UL>
<P>QLHot=34512 </P>
</UL>

<P>to Ms Word for Windows 6's WinWord6.INI file, which acts as a counter
recorder system, setting a date 14 days in the future for payload activation.
</P>

<P>HOT then copies the included macros to the Global Template, NORMAL.DOT
usually, revising their names... </P>

<PRE>        AutoOpen          ==&gt;   StartOfDoc
        DrawBringInFrOut  ==&gt;   AutoOpen
        InsertPBreak      ==&gt;   InsertPageBreak
        ToolsRepaginat    ==&gt;   FileSave
</PRE>

<P>A listing of the currently loaded macros in this infected environment
will reveal the names in the right list. Loading another infected document
&lt;actually a template&gt; will add the left list to the macro list plus
the right list. NOTE: Macros have been saved with the 'execute-only' feature,
which means that a user can't view or edit them. </P>

<P>A clean &lt;AutoMacros disabled&gt; WORD environment will produce the
left list when viewing an infected document. </P>

<P>HOT's FileSave macro cause the virus to randomly decide within 1-6 days
from the infection date to activate whenever an effort to open files is
made. Upon activation, a document will have it's contents deleted, by opening
it, slecting the entire contents, delting them, and closing the document,
saving it in it's now empty state. </P>

<P>Users with c:\DOS\EGA5.CPI should be protected from this macro, as the
author included a check for this file as a protective measure, noted in
the source code as follows: </P>

<PRE>  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  '- Main danger section: if TodayNo=(QLHotDateNo + RndDateNo) ---
  '- and if File C:DOSega5.cpi not exist (not for OUR friends) ---
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

<P>HOT's InsertPBreak Macro inserts a page-break in current documents,
which is used as a sign of a document already being infection by HOT. </P>

<P>NOTE: WordMacro/Hot relies on the existence of KERNEL.EXE </P>

<P>To clean existing in memory infected macros, use the TOOLS/MACROS/DELETE
function to delete all infected macros. Do the same for Document you find
that are infected, by doing so from a session of word with AutoMacros Disabled,
and using the Tools/Macros/Delete function. </P>

<P>NOTE: Use of the TOOL/MACRO command can be dangerous. Some viruses subvert
this command. Use with caution. Use AV software to find and delete infected
macros. </P>

</B></P>

<P>This is a new MACRO Trojan, &lt;that's been around for 2 years&gt; that
goes by the alias WinWord.Weideroffnen. It is technically a WinWord 2 infected
document, that works eqwually well under MS WORD 6.x. It intercepts AutoClose,
and attempts to play tricks with boot-up file AUTOEXEC.BAT. It is rumored
to exist in Germany, known locally in Germany as &quot;Weideroffen Macro
Virus&quot; No other information is available at this time, other than
the post by Graham Cluley, which states... </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Dr Solomon's FindVirus has been detecting this virus for a while
(I think we call it WinWord.Weideroffnen). Our WinGuard VxD can also intercept
documents infected with it thus stopping an outbreak dead in its tracks&quot;

<P>Quite possibly the first Macro Virus to hit the AMI PRO 3.0 Word Processor,
GREEN STRIPE, was first reported to Computer Weekly, by those who first
detected it Reflex Magnetics. &lt;reported to A.C.V by David Phillips (D.Phillips@open.ac.uk)
&gt; Reflex Magnetics is reported to has a program able to detect this
virus available on their WEB sites by the time you read this. </P>

<P>Ami Pro Macros are somewhat different than their WORD equivalents, as
an AMI PRO MACRO is a totally separate file, whereas WORD Macro viruses
turn documents into combination files, part data, part macro. The Ami Pro
macros are stored in a separate file, with the SMM extension. This makes
it difficult to spread an AMI PRO virus, as it is likely to not get copied
with the normal document, effectively disabling the virus. </P>

<P>Ami Pro's File/Save and File/Save As commands are intercepted by Green
Stripe, and used to infect all documents in comes in contact with. You
could say that GREEN STRIP is the first COMPANION MACRO VIRUS, as it doesn't
even touch the original document. </P>

<P>NOTE: Using File/Save As and saving an infected document to a network
drive or a floppy is the only likely way this virus will spread from a
machine to another. </P>

<P>When an infected document is loaded, it has a link to an AMI PRO auto-macro
file of the same name &lt;as the document&gt; but different extension.
This macro is then executed, and attempts to open ALL other documents in
the same directory &lt;to infect them&gt; This is apparent to the user,
as they can see this happening on the screen! It is reported to do a Search
and Replace on SAVE, searching and replacing all occurances of &quot;Its&quot;
with &quot; It's&quot;. Reportedly, this fails to work properly. </P>

<P>GREEN STRIPE was first Published in Mark Ludwigs virus writing newsletter,
this virus makes itself obvious to the user, since it attempts to infect
all files found in AMI PRO 3.0 Document Directory, during the initial infection
process which takes a long time, and the user is likely to notice that
something is going on,. </P>

<P>NOTE: Removal of AMI PRO 3.0 infected macros is simple, just delete
the macro from the directory. To see if a Macro has been attached to a
document, simply open the Tools/Macros/Edit menu and check whether the
document has a .SMM macro file assigned to be executed on open. If you
find one, delete it &lt;unless YOU created a legitimate macro&gt; </P>

<P>Documents and Macros in AMI PRO are ASCII files, making viewing and
detection of infected macros easy using any other program other than AMI
PRO. This virus is difficult to spread, as the path to the Macro is hard-coded,
preventing the macro from spreading if programs other than AMI PRO are
used to move it about. </P>

<P>Thanks to Vesselin Bontchev &lt;bontchev@complex.is&gt; and Dr David
Aubrey-Jones &lt;davidj@reflexd.demon.co.uk&gt; for detailing this virus.
</P>

<P><A NAME="4.8"></A><B>4.8 WORDMACRO ATOM / ATOMIC </B></P>

<P>This is a new Macro Virus, found in February 1996, which works along
the same general ideas as the original Concept virus. The WordMacro/Atom
virus is not known to be in the wild. </P>

<P>The differences, when compared to the Concept Virus, follows: </P>

<UL>
<P>- All the macros in this virus have been marked EXECUTE ONLY, making
them encrypted<BR>
- Replication occures both during file openings, and file saves.<BR>
- Atom comes with 2 destructive payloads </P>
</UL>

<P>On December 13th, it's first point of activation occures. It will attempt
to delete all files in the current file directory. </P>

<P>The second activation, password protects documents, restricting the
users access to their own documents. This happens when the system clock
seconds counter equals 13, and a File/Save As command is issued. The passowrd
assigned to the documents is ATOM#1. </P>

<P>If the user disables AUTOMACROS, Atom will be unable to execute and
spread to other documents. Enabling the Prompt To Save NORMAL.DOT will
prevent Atom from attacking and infecting the NORMAL.DOT file. </P>

<P><A NAME="4.9"></A><B>4.9 FORMATC MACRO TROJAN </B></P>

<P>Also known as WORDMACRO.FORMATC, and FORMAT.C.Macro.Trojan </P>

<P>The FORMATC Macro Virus, isn't ieven a virus, as it DOES NOT SPREAD.
This makes it another MACRO TROJAN. This Trojan contains only one macro,
AutoOpen, which will be executed automatically when a document is opened.
The Macro AutoOpen, is READ ONLY, making it encrypted, and unreadable and
editable. It is visiable in the Macro List. </P>

<P>When FORMATC is executed, &quot;triggered&quot;, it will run a dos session,
in a minimized DOS box. It will run an Unconditional Format of the C drive.
</P>

<P>NOTE: Get your hands on some up to date scanners, and pre-screen all
documents. Also acquire some AV VxD's, as they should prevent the Trojan
from wiping your drive clean. </P>

<P>Thanks to Symantec for providng the info on this trojan. </P>

<P><A NAME="5.0"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TOPIC 5: STRATEGY FOR CLEANING AND
PREVENTING WORD MACRO INFECTIONS: </FONT></B></P>

<P>The best Strategy for dealing with this new VIRUS Menace, is to acquire
at least one, maybe even a couple decent Anti-Virus products. This is a
good idea whether you are dealing with classic viruses, or this new MS
WORD MACRO family of viruses. If you have some of the popular virus scanners,
you can add macro virus signature definitions to them from the previous
sections of this FAQ, or acquire updated copies of your favorite AV programs,
which should have them built in. </P>

<P>Some products are now including Windows Mode VxD Virtual On-access Scanners,
that run co-operatively with Windows. &lt;insert bad joke about windows
reliability here :) &gt; These VxD's tend to have the same capabilities
as the classic scanners. Others that don't yet include VxD's are also worth
acquiring, as the command-line scanners are some of the best in the industry.
Most of the Virus Scanners Listed in the SUGGESTED SOFTWARE area of this
FAQ will in the worst case detect known MACRO Viruses, and at best, clean
existing infections, and prevent future infections by MACRO viruses. </P>

<P>The Following AV products now include an option to Scan for Word Macro
viruses, Including F-PROT, TBAV, AVP, AVTK, SOPHOS SWEEP, McAFEE, and others.
Fans of ChekMate will be glad to hear about CkekMate.DOC, part of the CHECKMATE
2.00 Generic Anti-Vitus Package, which will detect and prevent Macro infections.
</P>

<P>Learning to scan documents as well as program files will now be necessary
to maintain a clean system environment. So, keeping these new viruses out
of your system isn't really any harder than keeping standard viruses out.
Most of these products are listed in the SUGGESTED SOFTWARE area of this
FAQ. </P>

<P>A file, SCAN831.zip, common on various AV FTP Sites on the internet,
can deal with the WORD.Concept &lt;Prank&gt; virus. Unzipping it into the
Winword directory, and opening the included document SCAN831.DOC, will
check your documents for the presence of Concept. NOTE: This is only a
solution for preventing/removing Concept Infections. Also, Windows '95
users will need to dump the contents of their Start Menu document menu,
and remove desktop shortcuts before using this solution. NOTE: This `fix'
distributed by Microsoft isn't complete - there are ways to open documents
(like from the recently used files list) that don't trigger the protection
macros. </P>

<P>Fans of Symantec can download a free copy of REPAIR.ZIP, which contains
virus definition files for the macro viruses. You can use REPAIR.ZIP with
either NAV 95 or NAV 3.0. NOTE: To detect the MS Word macro viruses, scan
your hard drive from DOS only; either version of NAV will not detect them
from within Windows. </P>

<P>Disinfectant For the MAC, although a great AV product, doesn't generally
address macro viruses or hypercard infectors. &lt;At least it didn't the
last time I played with a MAC :) &gt; Disinfectant does not deal with non-machine
code viruses, so no update is needed. Mac users will want to contact some
of the AV producers listed below, as many of them are now offering MAC
AV solutions which DO deal with MS WORD MACRO VIRUSES. Some of the Word
macro viruses will work at least in part on a MAC, Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus
Toolkit for Macintosh will detect such infections, and will detect PC Boot
Sector Viruses. Mac Users will have one advantage fighting and finding
WORD MACRO VIRUSES, since MAC displays the icon of the data files, users
will notice that infected documents appear with the template icon, rather
than the usual document icon. </P>

<P>A Good Back-Up routine is also a sensible addition to any AV strategy.
No AV product is perfect, especially against new and unknown Viruses &lt;unless
you are ZVI NETIZ, his AV products catch 100% of all viruses, including
the cold viruses you've suffered with this winter! Unfortunately ZVI's
product will delete all copies of your SOFIA files :) &gt; </P>

<P>It is often preferable to replace infected files with clean uninfected
copies, regardless of format, than to execute a &quot;cleansed&quot; file,
that may be corrupt, or at least unstable. This is good advice for standard
executables.. but MS WORD docs can be cleaned most of the time simply by
removing the infected macros, and saving the file as a NORMAL Document!
</P>

<UL>
<P>Personal MACRO VIRUSES PREVENTION... </P>
</UL>

<P>For those of you who would rather deal with the MACRO problem yourself,
without using one of the recommended products, there are a few things you
can do to add an extra measure of security &lt;although it is really a
false sense of security...&gt; </P>

<P>Disabling of AutoOpen Macros is possible by invoking the Word system
Macro DisableAutoMacros. An once of prevention equals a pound of cure.
:) NOTE: this can be disabled by some Macro viruses. :( </P>

<P>The Manual for WORD for Windows says you can also do this from the command
line, by executing WORD with the following command... </P>

<UL>
<P>WINWORD.EXE /mDisableAutoMacros </P>
</UL>

<P>However, due to a Flaw, Feature, or Bug &lt;Gotta Love MS&gt; this doesn't
appear to work! Thanks MS! :( </P>

<P>The Manual also states that holding &lt;SHIFT&gt; while opening documents
will prevent any AutoExecute type macros from running, but this suggestion
also doesn't appear to work! Thanks Again MS! :( </P>

<P>Or better yet, you could create your own AutoExec Macro, it isn't hard,
simply select the TOOLS Menu, hit the MACRO command, and create a new macro
call &quot;AutoExec&quot;. Alter line 3 as you see fit... </P>

<PRE>       Sub Main
         DisableAutoMacros
         MsgBox &quot;MS WORD AutoMacros Disabled.&quot;, &quot;Some Protection!&quot;, 64
       End Sub

or...

       Sub Main
         DisableAutoMacros
         MsgBox &quot;MS WORD AutoMacros Disabled!&quot;, 0
       End Sub
</PRE>

<P>The second macro should display the message in the status line. &lt;I
hope&gt; :) </P>

<P>NOTE: Use of the TOOL/MACRO command can be dangerous. Some viruses subvert
this command. Use with caution. Use AV software to find and delete infected
macros. </P>

<P>This method will effectively prevent CONCEPT, HOT, DMV, and NUCLEAR
word macro viruses from infecting the WORD environment, by fooling these
3 viruses into thinking they've already infected your system. It also Disables
AutoMacros, which will help with some Macro infectors. This is a temporary
fix, as WORD gives priority to macros in documents over system macros.
&lt;MS will need to ship an update to WORD for all platforms that will
give control back to the users. Can you all say WORD '99? &gt; </P>

<P>All legitimate owners of copies of MS WORD should CALL MICROSOFT Support
staff, and let them know you want an updated copy WORD. Let them know you
want the BUGS FIXED. It's your right! Call Microsoft Product Support Services
at 206-462-9673 for Word for Windows, or send an Internet e-mail message
to wordinfo@microsoft.com &lt;wonder if we could cause a class action suit....&gt;
</P>

<P>Another option is to check the TOOLS/OPTION Menu and set it to prompt
before saving NORMAL.DOT. Setting the File Attributes of the file to read-only
may help, but anyone going to the effort of writing a Macro Virus can easily
disable that attribute. &lt;and if you've read this FAQ, you also know
that some macro viruses can enable AutoMacros even if you specifically
disable them! :( &gt; </P>

<P>NOTE: Use of the TOOL/MACRO command can be dangerous. Some viruses subvert
this command. Use with caution. Use AV software to find and delete infected
macros. </P>

<P>AMI PRO 3.0 Users, who want to clean their system of infected AMI PRO
3.0 GREEN STRIPE MACROS, need only look in their document directory, and
delete and infected macros &lt;which will have the same names as documents&gt;
Note: detection of GREEN STRIPE infection is easy, view all macros with
a NON-AMI PRO viewer, like DOS edit. Find infected macros, and delete them.
that's it!. </P>

<UL>
<P>SOFTWARE ALTERNATIVES TO USING WINWORD.EXE... </P>
</UL>

<P>At the time of this writing, it was mentioned to me that MicroSoft had
released a WORD Document Viewer, that does not execute Macros, that could
be used in place of WORD for the purpose of viewing Documents while on-line.
MSN or it's affiliated BBS services should have the file available for
download. Also, a number of Shareware and Freeware shells can directly
view WORD documents, without executing macros. Eric Phelps has noted that
an updated version of the WordViewer is now available. The new WordView
7.1 free viewing utility from Microsoft now runs some Word macros!! If
you want to view documents without the abiltiy to run macros, then stick
to versions of WordView previous to version 7.1 </P>

<P>Users of NETSCAPE 2 who fear virus infection by macro viruses while
onl the WWW, can now acquire Inso's new Word Plug-In Viewer (Inso wrote
the Quick View utility in Win95). Inso's URL is: </P>
