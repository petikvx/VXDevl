    When my PC started quoting scripture, I knew I was in trouble.
</P><P>  
    There are only a few reasons why a computer would suddenly flash 
    Matthew, chapter 6 verse 26, late at night: 
</P>
<ol>
  <li> It wants to be a member of the board of censors (though it might be overqualified); 
  </li>
  <li> It wants to go into TV evangelism (though it would need to buy some awful 
    clothes); </li>
  <li> It has the dreaded "V" word. </li>
</ol>
<P>  
    Briefly considering the first two possibilities, I settled on the 
    third. I was aided to this conclusion by systematic reasoning, 
    inductive analysis, and the discovery that my word processor has just 
    been trashed. Then other programs went kaput.
</P><P>  
    Not every computer virus is heralded by a biblical quotation. This 
    one -- let's call it Matthew -- goes around telling its victims to 
    "Look at the birds in the sky/They do not sow or reap... " What it's 
    ACTUALLY saying is "yea and verily are thine EXE files creamed."
</P><P>  
    Unruffled, I swung into action, coolly going through the standard 
    procedures for such an emergency. First, I generated cold sweat on my 
    brow at the regulation temperature and bead number. Next I utilized 
    some of the language prescribed for the occasion -- and similar ones, 
    such as when you see the faces of the President's appointees to 
    Comelec. [1]
</P><P>  
    Having done that I went to the next stage: a carefully contrived 
    total paralysis that ensures full concentration on the task at hand. 
    This is best accomplished by staring blankly at the screen, with a 
    vacuous expression on your face. 
</P><P>  
    So there I was, rushing to meet several deadlines, and my computer 
    fries itself. No word processor, no platform, no fax program. Instead 
    the machine was going around popping Matthew 6:26 at me. 
</P><P>  
    From my expert evaluation, based on roughly one part logic, four 
    parts imagination and 900 parts paranoia, the virus seems to infect 
    one program, which when used, spreads the Bad News for Modern Man to 
    other programs.
</P><P>  
    Not only that, when it goes forth to multiply, Matthew is invisible 
    to the usual virus detectors. My computer scans itself automatically 
    each time it boots up, but it didn't catch this critter.
</P><P>  
    Furthermore, in an amazing development that I would NEVER consider 
    making up, Matthew destroyed all the computer programs related to 
    work, but spared all the games.
</P><P>  
    Now, some people might allege that I don't mind a virus which lets me 
    off work. That's a canard. There's a time for work and a time for 
    play. Besides I was afraid the virus would decide to go for the games 
    anyway.
</P><P>  
    Well, it WAS a bit awkward, explaining what I was doing. "I'm not 
    working because my computer has been struck by a nasty, bible-quoting 
    virus. So why I playing 'Wolfenstein 3-D' just now? Well see, the 
    virus (which is invisible) only infected my work programs."
</P><P>  
    Anyway, what sort of person would write a virus like this? Probably 
    the type who goes on to write software for automatic teller machines. 
    Ever try withdrawing from an ATM when it's acting up? The truth is it 
    was PROGRAMMED to act like that by people who want to recall the 
    virus-creating days of their of their twisted youth.
</P><P>  
    You know how encounters which such ATM's go. Some of these machines 
    even have speakers and vaguely female voices. Try changing your 
    personal identification number with a monster like that.
</P>
<blockquote>
  <p> Customer: This machine isn't working </p>
  <p> ATM (cheerfully): You have entered the wrong PIN. Please enter the correct 
    code again </p>
  <p> Customer (punches number): I'm trying to CHANGE my PIN </p>
  <p> ATM: You have entered the wrong PIN </p>
  <p> Customer: Can't you understand? I'm changing my effing PIN </p>
  <p> ATM: You have entered the wrong PIN </p>
  <p> Customer: I'm changing your keyboard with this hammer </p>
  <p> ATM: You have been shot 6.25 times by the security guard. Have a nice day. 
  </p>
  <p> Programmers of such machines go on to have successful careers in tabulating 
    votes and computing BIR's revenues. [2] </p>
</blockquote>
<P>  
    So what did I do with my infected computer? I tried fixing it. Now 
    some people, who lead trouble-fee lives and probably live in 
    rent-controlled homes, can cheerfully solve their computer problems. 
    If the problem is an infected hard disk, then they just pop in a 
    backup copy of the programs and they're up and running.
</P><P>  
    My relations with PCs aren't quite like that. For me the procedures 
    are a bit more complex.
</P>
<ol>
  <li> I try reinstalling the program from diskettes. </li>
  <li> I find out that the diskettes have bad sectors. </li>
  <li> I try to fix the diskettes with other programs </li>
  <li> I have to look for where I put the programs </li>
  <li> I discover the disk drives are dirty </li>
  <li> I look for cleaning disks. </li>
  <li> I find the bottle of cleaning fluid is empty </li>
  <li> I finally start reinstalling the program {see (1)} </li>
  <li> I discover I need a "blank formatted disk" </li>
  <li> My blank formatted disk isn't blank </li>
  <li> The program that does the formatting is the one I'm trying to install {see 
    (1)} </li>
</ol>
<P>  
    Usually I finish such simple procedures in time for the next 
    presidential election. 
</P><P>  
    Thankfully, ___________ of _________ broke this simple procedure by 
    suggesting that I try out an anti-virus program called ___________. 
    That same night, I used the fax/modem card in my computer, hooked it 
    to my phone and called up several electronic bulletin boards. One of 
    them had the program, so I downloaded it.
</P><P>  
    When I ran ___________ I found out that at least 50 programs in my 
    hard disk had been infected. I cleaned them up. I still have to 
    reinstall them but at least my hard drive is now Matthew free.
</P><P>  
    Now, you might ask, how did I run my fax/modem if my hard disk was 
    infected? Simple. My supplier, ________________, lent me a hard disk 
    full of programs. I disconnected my old drive and ran everything from 
    the one I borrowed. 
</P>
<P> It wasn't my drive, but at least it was functioning and just in time to meet 
  my deadlines. I plunged headlong back into computing and played several hours 
  worth of "Dune 2: The Building of a Dynasty," an excellent wargame which I found 
  on the drive I had borrowed. What a relief. </P>
