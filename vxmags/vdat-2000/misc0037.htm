<P>Chen Ing-hau, a former Taiwan college student, was detained by authorities 
  in that nation after his school, the Tatung Institute of Technology, outed him 
  as the author of the CIH computer virus.</P>

<P>Ing-hau (his initials are "CIH," get it?) was reprimanded by
school authorities in 1998, who knew about him as far back as April of 
that year, when CIH virus first emerged in world circulation. Although
news stories about CIH circled the globe at the time, much like the
current crop of news pieces, apparently few were interested.</P> 

<P>In a news story distributed by the Associated Press on April
30, Ing-hau claimed he had "created" CIH to "humiliate and take
revenge on . . . incompetent anti-virus software providers."</P>

<P>The claim, a rather shopworn one among virus authors for the greater
part of the decade, has been repeated so often in the virus 
underground as a rationalization for spreading the programs that
even people who don't write viruses are often familiar with it.</P>

<P>According to AP, Ing-hau created CIH because he was also irate
that he had been a victim of computer viruses as a result of his 
trafficking in computer games.</P>

<P>Ing-hau's claims, in addition to being unintentionally hilarious,
paint a picture of someone completely unaware of his own hyprocrisy.</P>

<P>Rod Fewster, an Australian anti-virus expert commented in <a href="ezines1.htm#CRYPT">Crypt 
  Newsletter 50</a> from August 1998 that the CIH virus was put into the wild 
  by uploading infected copies to Gamerz sites -- legitimate and underground -- 
  disguised as various software cracks and cheats and to pirated software sites 
  as a phony serial number crack for the Windows98 beta.</P>

<P>In June of 1998, after computer game fetishists and software pirates
had downloaded CIH contaminated software, one of the biggest gaming 
sites on the Net posted a warning about the infected downloads
along with an URL pointing to an anti-virus software program
that detected and removed it.</P>

<P>At the time, places that had infections seemed to have been 
predominantly universities where a student was using school computers 
and network time to satisfy his taste for pirated software or trivial
computer games he couldn't afford in the store.</P>

<P>"I had it on a university in the Netherlands," commented Fewster,
adding it had spread very quickly in this environment.</P>

<P>Ing-hau, apparently something of a PC game pirate himself,
and angered over getting new computer viruses from downloaded games,
wrote his own virus that was immediately seeded into the same
types of sites he had been victimized from. In a simple stroke,
CIH's author had made himself into that which he hated.</P>

<P>Wire service news reports claimed Ing-hau had not been severely
disciplined in April of 1998 because he had "warned fellow students
not to spread the virus."</P>

<P>Can you smell the burning odor of phlogiston?</P>

<P>In America, CIH, just like most year-old viruses
for which detection routines exist, proved to be a bust despite 
widespread mainstream media attention.</P>

<P>The Associated Press reported a measly four site infections on 
thirty computers by mid-day of CIH high noon. Gossip on the Usenet
put the figure considerably higher. ATLAS-T's author, Nick Brown,
reported to Crypt News a couple of hits near Strasbourg on the 
26th, owners of which fit the Western CIH victim: student 
warez-fetishists.</P> 

<P>However, Taiwanese authorities seemed nothing but bewildered 
after detaining Chen Ing-hau as a result of media attention and 
subsequently finding there were no initial complaints of 
damage against him.</P>

<P>Astonishingly high figures of CIH's damage were circulated in 
the media: 600,000 dinged computers -- reportedly in Asia -- being 
the most widely reprinted. The figure was supplied by
a collection of assumptions: 360,000 in China, 240,000 in South 
Korea. But none in Taiwan by the same types of news reports.</P>

<P>Of this, Rob Rosenberger of Virus Myths wryly said:</P>

<P>"Yeah, the numbers come from some bureaucratic assistant minister(s) 
for technology who 'speculated' on the total number of PCs destroyed 
in his ho-dink [Asian] country.  We'll never know the magic equation used to 
calculate the arbitrary value . . . It'll go down in urban legends as 
a media-spouted, government-approved figure, just like the 250,000 
hacker attacks on Department of Defense per year . . ."</P>
