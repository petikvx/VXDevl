 As you may or may not know, the Thunderbyte resident av utilities hook
 themselves to the device driver chain using the following device names:
 TBDRVXXX, TBFILXXX, TBDSKXXX, TBMEMXXX, TBCHKXXX and TBLOGXXX.
 Now, by doing trial handle opens you can detect if those devices do or
 do not exist et voila, you have a method for testing residency. TBAV
 itself scans the actual device driver chain for the TB???XXX devices
 which is unlike this method, pretty much impossible to confuse, but also
 undocumented and thus it's not guaranteed to work under future versions
 of DOS! Yes, Frans Veldman calls vile and unsafe functions in his battle
 against replicating codefragments.

 Added note: Just recently I was looking at the EMM virus written by
 the author of the OneHalf family and found that it traces the device
 chain to detect thunderbyte residency. This means that this kind of
 detection isn't exactly new. Oh well, what the heck.
