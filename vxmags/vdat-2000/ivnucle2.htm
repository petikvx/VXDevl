etc..</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, lets see. I'm 19, a full time student (15 credit hours)
and a technology freak. My other hobby is music. A few years ago I was
introduced into the whole "electronic dance" thing, then shortly after
jungle and drum&amp;bass. I have been addicted ever since. Something in
me just clicked. One thing lead to another, I spent a few thousand bucks
on records, started spinning, quit spinning, then picked up a few drum
machines and so forth, and started producing shitty tracks =], but I love
it. My handle is from the center of a cell, read up on your biology for
more info.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, a few.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I first started writing viruses, shitty .com overwriters,
I just added random text strings in them, not really naming them. Now moving
on to bigger and better things, I'm starting to depend on a payload for
a name. I just finished a virus with a payload that looks like the interface
for f-prot v3.. as a little message to the av, and a greeting to Fridrik.
Inspired after he called me a "nit wit' in alt.comp.virus because I don't
take computers seriously. Hence the name the frisk virus. Hell knows what
caro is going to call it though. =] Now I'm working on an com/exe/sys infector
that will display a conversation from a anime movie called "The Ghost in
the Shell" when the conditions are correct.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My first and only programming language is assembly. I was learning
assembler, the workings of a processor and memory, and viruses all at the
same time. Learning asm was the best teacher, because it forces you to
read and learn about what's going on inside that magic box.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When you start out in VX?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was infected with a strain of cascade when I first got a
computer and internet access. I never scanned anything, and downloaded
everything I saw.,heh ., so I'm not surprised it happened. Due to the whole
cleaning process, and the thought of some damn file spread all over my
hard disk on its own (err., well, sorta...) I was quickly finding myself
downloading virus collections from everywhere. I discovered all the vx
zines and tutorials, meet someone who knew asm, and the rest is history
from there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What your fav AV? and the reason ?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>F-prot, because for home use Fridrik does his shit for free.
That is something that just doesn't happen too much anymore, and when it
does happen the product is usually crap. Its a nice scanner, pretty fast,
has decent heuristics, and offers a vdx monitor. The only downside is frisk
software is a little slow with their updates, but hey, its free so you
can only bitch but so much. I also run AVP on my system due to weekly updates
that are made available, but it runs much slower on my system and I don't
really like the interface, but hell, thats not important.,hehe.,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How about VX move in USA, tell Us</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hmm,. that's a tough one. There is not much of a vx scene here
in the states. I know a handful of other writers over here, none personally
though. It just seems to me that 80 percent of the viruses writers that
I know are currently active are not in the USA. That and the fact that
virus writers in other parts of the world seem to be a little more in touch
with each other. If someone ever tried to organize a meeting here most
likely nobody would go.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you like a specific type of virus?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, umm., I have always liked mbr infectors, I guess because
I have never tried to write one cause I'm way too lame for that. File viruses
are all I have really played with, and until I get another pc, I don't
really want to start fucking around with my boot sector. I have a ton of
non replaceable crap on my hd that I don't have backed up at the time.
If I was better at programming then this would be a different story but
the data on my hd is more important than testing a boot infector.., to
me anyway,..</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you think about destructive viruses?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think I don't really care. Its wrong to distroy others data.
I have written harmful code in the past, but now try to avoid it. If I
do add harmful code ever again, it will most likely only be towards floppies
or something else worthless. We will just have to wait and see.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What's your opinion about wordmacro viruses?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I never really liked them too much. They sure as hell sever
their purpose in the days of ms word being everywhere. I just see them
as being way too limiting. I enjoy having control over hardware, not just
ms word.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about virus generation kits and such?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>People that write them are crazy.,.hehe,. They seem like a
pretty big task to create one, and I give much respect to that. I'm not
sure how I feel about people using them. Most are crap and a handful are
great learning tools. When I first started learning how to code 31337 com
overwriters, <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#OVCT">Virtual Daemon's OVCK</A> was
a dream come true. It was almost better than reading all 100 million tutorials
on the subject. I'm one of those people that learn by a "hands on" experience.
So it helped me alot with getting basic technics down.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Macro viruses you can only do but so much with, the same with
hll. Like I said, they all serve their purpose (exploiting microsoft),
and all have found their way into being very popular in the last part of
this millennium.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus.</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No detection, No removal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No, and they never will be in my country. It would rape my
constituatnal rights as a US citizen. Even if they did pass some whacked
out law like that, some crazy fucker would take it to the supreme court
and have it fixed. People don't like being stripped of their rights, even
if it could do better in the long run.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are you think about sourceofkaos.com</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>haha., I think I'm glad our server is owned by a really nice
guy. Its nice to have a site hosted by an X-vx'er. I hope it stays around
for a long, long time. Long Live jtr!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That's another hard one. I have much respect for all the Vx'ers
past and present. I like <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29a</A>, <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">slam</A>,
<A HREF="groups1.htm#CB">the codebreakers</A>, and the invaders. 29a (err.,
and a little from vlad..=]) has released alot of the much needed info on
win32 infection, many new coding ideas, and quite a few very famous viruses.
I love the newer SLAM team, and the issue 4 of the <A HREF="ezines1.htm#SLAM">mag</A>
was just dope. The codebreakers are doing a great job as teachers. They
started from the ground up, I highly recommend reading their mags in order
to learn the art of virus programming. The invaders are going to go down
in history if the ball ever gets rolling. Watch out guys! I also have much
respect for anyone who supports Vx United past, present and future. I hope
the project grows, and maybe one day out lives me. I really don't want
to get started on individual writers because the list would be twice as
long as this entire interview, and i always forget the important people.
So to the virus writer young and old, Much Respect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
out the VX world?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anyone who is creative. Anyone that is on the forefront of
technology.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are/were you a member of a VX group?</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">This space is for you, just write what ever you
like (no Space limit)</FONT></B>
</P><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, since hopefully someone will be reading this someday,
I guess I would like to say:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P><P>
<OL>
<LI>
 Do what ever the hell you want to do no matter what anyone else has
to say about it.</LI>

<LI>
 Be respectful of others opinions.</LI>

<LI>
 Enjoy your life, don't waste away and die regretting not accomplishing
goals you had set for yourself. I sure as hell won't.</LI>
</OL>
<p></P><P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all?</FONT></B>
