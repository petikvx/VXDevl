<P>New or modified entries are now flagged with two plus symbols at the
beginning of the line. Sorry if I missed any on this update.</P>

<P>@@ Amendments between official upgrades are now flagged with two ampersands
(@@) in the first two columns rather than three plus signs (+++). This
is because I usually edit this document from home, and +++ has a specific
meaning to Hayes-compatible modems which I invariably forget about. </P>

<P>++ Maintenance of this FAQ is now shared between the following:</P>

<P>Exactly how (not to mention if) this will work in practice has yet to
be determined. For the moment, it will work as follows. </P>

<P>George will do the real work, like making sure the darn thing is posted
regularly and organizing archiving, posting automagically etc., keeping
an eye on whether URLs are still current etc. Bruce and I will concentrate
on doing what we do best: Bruce will keep an eye open for sloppy grammar
and general imprecision; I'll sit here claiming credit for the work of
others and make the final decision in the event of any contention. All
three of us will refer to ourselves as &quot;co-maintainer&quot; rather
than &quot;maintainer&quot;. </P>

<P>Any of us may choose to suggest edits, additions and subtractions to/from
the FAQ, but, with effect from the next revision, all edits will be agreed
between the three of us before inclusion in the FAQ. If anyone else wishes
to contribute a suggestion, alteration or addition, they can send it to
any or all of the above, and it will be used subject to the agreement of
all three of us. </P>

<H2>Disclaimer</H2>

<P>This document is primarily concerned with defending the integrity of
computing systems and preventing damage caused by viruses or other malicious
and/or other unauthorized software. It attempts to address many of the
issues which are frequently discussed on alt.comp.virus, but does not claim
to represent all shades of opinion among the users of a.c.v. - in particular,
it does not include information which, in my estimation, is likely to be
of more help to those interested in the spreading of unauthorized and/or
malicious software than to those who wish to be protected from it. </P>

<P>This document is an honest attempt to help individuals with computer
virus-related problems and queries. It can <B>not</B> be regarded as being
in any sense authoritative, and has no legal standing. The authors accept
no responsibility for errors or omissions, or for any ill effects resulting
from the use of any information contained in this document. </P>

<H2>(i) What is the FAQ, and who is it for?</H2>

<P>This FAQ is intended to make available answers to questions which are
repeatedly asked on alt.comp.virus, and tries to gather the most useful
information regarding this group and the issues discussed here into a relatively
short document. The hope is to produce (eventually) an easily-digested
document for newcomers, as a means of saving those who regularly reply
to posted questions having to re-invent the wheel each time. </P>

<P>I recommend that you read this FAQ in conjunction with the comp.virus
(VIRUS-L)FAQ, which gives more detailed information regarding some issues
which are, inevitably, covered in both FAQs. </P>

<P>The VIRUS-L/comp.virus FAQ is regularly posted to the comp.virus newsgroup.
The latest version should be available as: </P>

<P>which is very long and very thorough. This document is subject to revision,
so the file name may change. </P>

<P>A very terse mini-FAQ maintained by George Wenzel is posted more or
less daily to alt.comp.virus. I am now regularly posting a guide to virus-related
FAQs (contact details and digest of contents), which I plan to extend to
other security areas eventually, as a supplement to this FAQ. Both these
resources will eventually be available by FTP/WWW. </P>

<P>++ The guide to virus-related FAQs is withdrawn for the present, due
to the need for extensive updating </P>

<H2>(iii) Guide to posting etiquette</H2>

<P>Messages asking for help posted to alt.comp.virus are more likely to
receive a useful response if they conform to accepted standards of civility.
The newsgroup news.announce.newusers includes information on good newsgroup
etiquette, or try </P>

<P>However, adhering to the following guidelines would be particularly
helpful: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Keep your lines short (say 72 characters per line), so that anyone
who follows up doesn't have to reformat quoted text to keep it readable).</LI>

<LI>Don't quote all or most of a message you're following up unless it's
either very short, or necessary in order to address each point made. In
the latter case, please put the point you're answering close to your answer
and try to format it so that it's readable. Remember that some people have
to pay for connection/download time.</LI>

<LI>On the other hand, a message which says something like 'I totally agree'
without including enough of the original for us to tell what you're agreeing
with is a waste of bandwidth.</LI>

<LI>Keep it polite. It's unlikely that anyone who replies to your posting
is being paid to do so, and it wouldn't excuse bad manners if they were.
Of course, the cut and thrust of debate may be a different matter altogether....</LI>

<LI>Asking for a reply by direct e-mail may be reasonable if you need an
urgent solution or are using a borrowed account. It isn't reasonable if
you simply can't be bothered to check newsgroups. At least try to think
up a good excuse, and be prepared to offer a summary to the group.</LI>

<LI>Check that there isn't already a thread on the subject you're asking
about before posting yet another 'Has anyone heard of the GOOD TIMES virus?'
message. If there is, check it first: the answer to your question may already
be there (if it isn't in this document!). Please remember that many people
have to pay for connect time, and don't appreciate duplicate postings or
uuencoded binaries.</LI>

<LI>If you want to follow up a message which doesn't seem particularly
relevant to alt.comp.virus, check the 'Newsgroups:' header: there have
been a lot of responses to spammings recently which have made increased
the bandwidth used, often quite unnecessarily.</LI>

<LI>Please don't post test messages here unless you really need to: use
one of the newsgroups intended for the purpose: there is probably one local
to your news server - ask your Systems Administrator, provider or local
helpdesk. If you must post to the entire Internet, use misc.test - if you
do, put the word IGNORE in your Subject: field, or you'll get auto-responder
messages in your mail for weeks afterwards. Look through the postings in
news.announce.newusers for relevant guidelines before you post.</LI>

<LI>If you get into an exchange of E-mail, please remember that not everyone
can handle all forms of E-mail attachment (uuencoded, MIME format etc.
- if it's text, <B>send</B> it as text. NB also that (uu)encoding text
makes it longer as well as unreadable, so don't!</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="PREF4"></A></P>

<H2>(iv) How to ask on the alt.comp.virus newsgroup for help</H2>

<P>The more relevant information you give us, the more we can help you.
It helps to tell us the following: </P>

<UL>
<LI>What you think the problem is (you might think it's a virus, but maybe
it isn't)</LI>

<LI>What the symptoms are. If you ran some software that gave you a message,
tell us which package, version number, and the exact wording of the message.</LI>

<LI>Please be as accurate as possible about the order in which events happened.</LI>

<LI>If just one file is infected, give the filename.</LI>

<LI>If you're running more than one anti-virus product, please list them
(including version number), and say what each one said about the possible
virus.</LI>

<LI>Which version of which operating system you are running.</LI>

<LI>Any other configuration information which you think may have a bearing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Don't take action, then ask if that was the right action - if it wasn't,
it's too late. </P>

<P>Don't just ask &quot;I've got xyz virus, can anyone help me&quot;. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV01"></A></P>

<H2>(1) I have a virus problem - what do I do?</H2>

<P>The following guidelines will, one hopes, be of assistance. However,
you may get better use out of them if you read the rest of this document
before acting rashly... </P>

<P>If you think you may have a virus infection, <B>stay calm</B>. Once
detected, a virus will rarely cause (further) damage, but a panic action
might. Bear in mind that not every one who thinks s/he has a virus actually
does (and a well-documented, treatable virus might be preferable to some
problems!). Reformatting your hard disk is almost certainly unnecessary
and very probably won't kill the virus. </P>

<P>If you've been told you have something exotic, consider the possibility
of a false alarm and check with a different package. </P>

<P>If you have a good antivirus package, use it. Better still, use more
than one. If there's a problem with the package, use the publisher's tech
support and/or try an alternative package. If you don't have a package,
get one (see section on sources below). If you're using Microsoft's package
(MSAV) get something less out-of-date. </P>

<P>Follow the guidelines below as far as is practicable and applicable
to your situation. </P>

<P>Try to get expert help <B>before</B> you do anything else. If the problem
is in your office rather than at home there may be someone whose job includes
responsibility for dealing with virus incidents. </P>

<P>Follow the guidelines below as far as is practicable and applicable.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Do not attempt to continue to work with an infected system, or let
other people do so.</LI>

<LI>Generally, it's considered preferable to switch an infected system
off until a competent person can deal with it: don't allow other people
to use it in the meantime. If possible, close down applications, Windows
etc. properly and allow any caches/buffers to flush, rather than just hit
the power switch.</LI>

<LI>If you have the means of checking other office machines for infection,
you should do so and take appropriate steps if an infection is found.</LI>

<LI>If you are unable to check other machines, assume that all machines
are infected and take all possible steps to avoid spreading infection any
further.</LI>

<LI>If there are still uninfected systems in the locality, don't use floppy
disks on them [except known clean write-protected DOS boot floppies]</LI>

<LI>users of infected machines should not <B>under any circumstances</B>
trade disks with others until their systems and disks are cleaned.</LI>

<LI>if the infected system is connected to a Novell network, Appleshare
etc., it should be logged off all remote machines unless someone knowledgeable
says different. If you're not sure how to do this, contact whoever is responsible
for the administration of the network. You should in any case ensure that
the network administrator or other responsible and knowledgeable individual
is fully aware of the situation.</LI>

<LI>No files should be exchanged between machines by any other means until
it's established that this can be done safely.</LI>

<LI>Ensure that all people in your office and anyone else at risk are aware
of the situation.</LI>

<LI>Get <B>all</B> floppy disks together for checking and check every one.
This includes write-protected floppies and program master disks. Check
all backups too (on tape or file servers as well as on floppy).</LI>

<H2>(2) Minimal Glossary</H2>

<P>[There is room for improvement and expansion here. Contributions will
be gratefully accepted.] </P>

<UL>
<P><B>AV</B> - AntiVirus. Sometimes applied as a shorthand term for anti-virus
researchers/programmers/publishers - may include those whose work is not
AV research, but includes virus-control. (See also Vx.) </P>

<P><B>BSI</B> - Boot Sector Infector (= BSV - Boot Sector Virus) </P>

<P><B>BIOS</B> - Basic Input Output System </P>

<P><B>CMOS</B> - Memory used to store hardware configuration information
</P>

<P><B>DBR</B> - DOS Boot Record </P>

<P><B>DBS</B> - DOS Boot Sector </P>

<P><B>False Positive</B> - When an antivirus program incorrectly reports
a virus in memory or infecting a file. Scanners in heuristic mode and integrity
checkers are, by definition, somewhat more prone to these. </P>

<P><B>False Negative</B> - Essentially, a virus undetected by an antivirus
program. </P>

<P><B>In-the-wild</B> - describes viruses known to be spreading uncontrolled
to real-life systems, as opposed to those which exist only in controlled
situations such as anti-virus research labs. Virus code which has been
published but not actually found spreading out of control is not usually
regarded as being in-the-wild. </P>

<P><B>MBR</B> - Master Boot Record (Partition Sector) </P>

<P><B>TSR</B> - A memory-resident DOS program, i.e one which remains in
memory while other programs are running. A good TSR should at least detect
all known in-the-wild viruses and a good percentage of other known viruses.
Generally, TSRs are not so good with polymorphic viruses, and should not
be relied on exclusively. </P>

<H2>(3) What is a virus (and what are Trojans and Worms)?</H2>

<P>A (computer) virus is a program (a block of executable code) which attaches
itself to, overwrites or otherwise replaces another program in order to
reproduce itself without the knowledge of the PC user. </P>

<P>Most viruses are comparatively harmless, and may be present for years
with no noticeable effect: some, however, may cause random damage to data
files (sometimes insidiously, over a long period) or attempt to destroy
files and disks. Others cause unintended damage. Even benign viruses (apparently
non-destructive viruses) cause significant damage by occupying disk space
and/or main memory, by using up CPU processing time, and by the time and
expense wasted in detecting and removing them. </P>

<P>A Trojan Horse is a program intended to perform some covert and usually
malicious act which the victim did not expect or want. It differs from
a destructive virus in that it doesn't reproduce, (though this distinction
is by no means universally accepted). </P>

<P>A dropper is a program which installs a virus or Trojan, often covertly.
</P>

<P>A worm is a program which spreads (usually) over network connections.
Unlike a virus, it does not attach itself to a host program. In practice,
worms are not normally associated with personal computer systems. There
is an excellent and considerably longer definition in the Mk. 2 version
of the Virus-L FAQ. </P>

<P>(The following is a slightly academic diversion) </P>

<P>A lot of bandwidth is spent on precise definitions of some of the terms
above. I have Fridrik Skulason's permission to include the following definition
of a virus, which I like because it demonstrates most of the relevant issues.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>#1 A virus is a program that is able to replicate - that is, create
(possibly modified) copies of itself. </P>

<P>#2 The replication is intentional, not just a side-effect. </P>

<P>#3 At least some of the replicants are also viruses, by this definition.
</P>

<P>#4 A virus has to attach itself to a host, in the sense that execution
of the host implies execution of the virus. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>#1 is the main definition, which distinguishes between viruses and Trojans
and other non-replicating malware. </P>

<P>#2 is necessary to exclude for example a disk-copying program copying
a disk, which contains a copy of itself. </P>

<P>#3 is necessary to exclude &quot;intended&quot; not-quite-viruses. </P>

<P>#4 is necessary to exclude &quot;worms&quot;, but at the same time it
has to be broad enough to include companion viruses and .DOC viruses. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV04"></A></P>

<H2>(4) How do viruses work?</H2>

<P>A file virus attaches itself to a file (but see the section below or
the comp.virus FAQ on the subject of companion viruses), usually an executable
application (e.g. a word processing program or a DOS program). In general,
file viruses don't infect data files. However, data files can contain embedded
executable code such as macros, which may be used by virus or trojan writers.
Text files such as batch files, postscript files, and source code which
contain commands that can be compiled or interpreted by another program
are potential targets for malware (malicious software), though such malware
is not at present common. </P>

<P>Boot sector viruses alter the program that is in the first sector (boot
sector) of every DOS-formatted disk. Generally, a boot sector infector
executes its own code (which usually infects the boot sector or partition
sector of the hard disk), then continues the PC bootup (start-up) process.
In most cases, all write-enabled floppies used on that PC from then on
will become infected. </P>

<P>Multipartite viruses have some of the features of both the above types
of virus. Typically, when an infected <B>file</B> is executed, it infects
the hard disk boot sector or partition sector, and thus infects subsequent
floppies used or formatted on the target system. </P>

<P>The following virus types are more fully defined in the comp.virus FAQs
(see preamble): </P>

<UL>
<P><B>STEALTH VIRUSES</B> - viruses that go to some length to conceal their
presence from programs which might notice. </P>

<P><B>POLYMORPHIC VIRUSES</B> - viruses that cannot be detected by searching
for a simple, single sequence of bytes in a possibly-infected file, since
they change with every replication. </P>

<P><B>COMPANION VIRUSES</B> - viruses that spread via a file which runs
instead of the file the user intended to run, and then runs the original
file. For instance, the file MYAPP.EXE might be 'infected' by creating
a file called MYAPP.COM. Because of the way DOS works, when the user types
MYAPP at the C&gt; prompt, MYAPP.COM is run instead of MYAPP.EXE. MYAPP.COM
runs its infective routine, then quietly executes MYAPP.EXE. N.B. this
is not the <B>only</B> type of companion (or 'spawning') virus. </P>

<P><B>ARMOURED VIRUSES</B> - viruses that are specifically written to make
it difficult for an antivirus researcher to find out how they work and
what they do. </P>
</UL>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV05"></A></P>

<H2>(5) How do viruses spread?</H2>

<P>A PC is infected with a boot sector virus (or partition sector virus)
if it is (re-)booted (usually by accident) from an infected floppy disk
in drive A. Boot Sector/MBR infectors are the most commonly found viruses,
and cannot normally spread across a network. These (normally) spread by
accident via floppy disks which may come from virtually any source: unsolicited
demonstration disks, brand-new software (even from reputable sources),
disks used on your PC by salesmen or engineers, new hardware, or repaired
hardware. </P>

<P>A file virus infects other files when the program to which it is attached
is run, and so <B>can</B> spread across a network (often very quickly).
They may be spread from the same sources as boot sector viruses, but also
from sources such as Internet FTP sites and bulletin boards. (This applies
also to Trojan Horses.) </P>

<P>A multipartite virus infects boot sectors <B>and</B> files. Often, an
infected file is used to infect the boot sector: thus, this is one case
where a boot sector infector could spread across a network. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV06"></A></P>

<H2>(6) How can I avoid infection?</H2>

<P>There is no way to guarantee that you will avoid infection. However,
the potential damage can be minimized by taking the following precautions:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>make sure you have a clean boot disk - test with whatever (up-to-date!)
antivirus software you can get hold of and make sure it is (and stays)
write-protected. Boot from it and make a couple of copies.</LI>

<LI>use reputable, up-to-date and properly-installed anti-virus software
regularly. (See below) If you use a shareware package for which payment
and/or registration is required, do it. Not only does it encourage the
writer and make you feel virtuous, it means you can legitimately ask for
technical support in a crisis.</LI>

<LI>do some reading (see below). If you're a home user, you may well get
an infection sooner or later. If you're a business user, it'll be sooner.
Either way you'll benefit from a little background. If you're a business
user you (or your enterprise) need a policy.</LI>

<LI>don't rely <B>solely</B> on newsgroups like this to get you out of
trouble: it may be a while before you get a response (especially from a
moderated group like comp.virus), and the first response you act upon may
not offer the most appropriate advice for your particular problem.</LI>

<LI>if you use a shareware/freeware package, make sure you have hard copy
of the documentation <B>before</B> your system falls apart!</LI>

<LI>always run a memory-resident scanner to monitor disk access and executable
files before they're run.</LI>

<LI>if you run Windows, a reputable anti-virus package which includes DOS
<B>and</B> Windows components is likely to offer better protection than
a DOS only package. If you run Windows 95, you need a proper Win95 32-bit
package for full protection.</LI>

<LI>make sure your home system is protected, as well as your work PC.</LI>

<LI>check all new systems and all floppy disks when they're brought in
(from <B>any</B> source) with a good virus-scanning program.</LI>

<LI>acquire software from reputable sources: 2nd-hand software is frequently
unchecked and sometimes infected. Bear in mind that shrinkwrapped software
isn't necessarily unused. In any case, reputable firms have shipped viruses
unknowingly.</LI>

<LI>once formatted, keep floppies write-disabled except when you need to
write a file to them: then write-disable them again.</LI>

<LI>make sure your data is backed up regularly and that the procedures
for restoring archived data <B>work</B> properly.</LI>

<LI>scan pre-formatted diskettes before use.</LI>

<LI>Get to know all the components of the package you're using and consider
which bits to use and how best to use them. Different packages have different
strengths: diversifying and mixing and matching can, if carefully and properly
done, be a good antivirus strategy, especially in a corporate environment</LI>

<LI>if your PC can be prevented with a CMOS setting from booting with a
disk in drive A, do it (and re-enable floppy booting temporarily when you
need to clean-boot).</LI>
</UL>

<H3>CMOS settings</H3>

<P>Some CMOSes come with special anti-virus settings. These are normally
vague about what they do but typically they write-protect your hard disk's
boot sector and partition sector (MBR). This can be some use against boot
sector viruses but may false alarm when you upgrade your operating system.
</P>

<P>One sensible setting to make (if your CMOS allows) is to adjust the
boot sequence of your PC. Changing the default boot-up drive order from
A: C: to C: will mean that the PC will attempt to boot from drive C: even
if a floppy disk has been left in drive A:. This way boot sector virus
infection can often be avoided. Remember, however, to set your CMOS back
temporarily if you ever <B>do</B> want to boot clean from floppy (for example,
when running a cryptographical checksummer after a cold boot). </P>

<P><B>++</B> SCSI controllers have their own BIOS. On some systems, this
will override the boot sequence set in CMOS. It's always a good idea to
check with a (known clean) bootable floppy after you've disabled floppy
booting that it really is disabled. I don't think it's necessary to use
the Rosenthal Simulator to do this, thank you, Doren. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV07"></A></P>

<H2>(7) How does antivirus software work?</H2>

<UL>
<P><B>Scanner</B> (conventional scanner, command-line scanner, on-demand
scanner) - a program that looks for known viruses by checking for recognisable
patterns ('scan strings', 'search strings', 'signatures'). </P>

<P><B>TSR scanner</B> - a TSR (memory-resident program) that checks for
viruses while other programs are running. It may have some of the characteristics
of a monitor and/or behaviour blocker. </P>

<P><B>VxD scanner</B> - a scanner that works under Windows or perhaps under
Win 95, or both), which checks for viruses continuously while you work.
</P>

<P><B>Heuristic scanners</B> - scanners that inspect executable files for
code using operations that might denote an unknown virus. </P>

<P><B>Monitor/Behaviour Blocker</B> - a TSR that monitors programs while
they are running for behaviour which might denote a virus. </P>

<P><B>Change Detectors/Checksummers/Integrity Checkers</B> - programs that
keep a database of the characteristics of all executable files on a system
and check for changes which might signify an attack by an unknown virus.
</P>

<P><B>Cryptographic Checksummers</B> use an encryption algorithm to lessen
the risk of being fooled by a virus which targets that particular checksummer.
</P>
</UL>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV08"></A></P>

<H2>(8) What's the best antivirus software (and where do I get it)?</H2>

<P>In case it's not absolutely clear from the following, I can't possibly
answer the first part of this question! There are, however, some suggestions
following for sources of software and of information on particular packages,
comparative reviews etc. The danger of this approach is that sites, servers,
and packages come and go, and I haven't time to keep track of all these
variables. Some of these URLs have been passed on by trusted sources, but
I haven't the time to check them all out regularly. If you run into problems,
please let me know (by e-mail, please). </P>

<P>Most of the people who post here have their favourites: if you just
ask which is the best, you'll generally get either a subjective &quot;I
like such and such&quot;, recommendation of a particular product by someone
who works for that company, or a request to be more specific about your
needs. Some of us who are heavily involved with virus control favour using
more than one package and keeping track of the market. Don't trust anything
you read in the non-technical press. Don't accept uncritically reviews
in the computing press, either: even highly-regarded IT specialists often
have little understanding of virus issues, and many journalists are specialists
only in skimming and misinterpreting. Magazines like <I>Virus Bulletin</I>
and <I>Secure Computing</I> are much better informed and do frequent comparative
reviews, and are also informative about their testing criteria, procedures
and virus suites. Recently, a number of articles have been posted here
by people who've run their own tests on various packages. These are often
of interest, but should not be accepted uncritically. (No-one's opinion
should be accepted uncritically!) </P>

<P>Valid testing of antivirus software requires a lot of care and thought,
and not all those who undertake it have the resources, knowledge or experience
to do it properly. </P>

<P>You may get a more informed response if you specify what sort of system
you have - DOS, Windows, Win95? XT, AT, 386 or better? Is the system networked,
and are you asking about protecting the whole network? (What sort of network?)
Are you running NT, OS/2 or Win95, any of which involve special considerations?
Be aware that there is more than one way of judging the effectiveness of
a package - the sheer number of viruses detected; speed; tendency to false
alarms; size (can you run it from a single floppy when necessary?); types
of virus detection &amp; prevention (not at all the same thing) offered
(command-line scanning, TSR scanning, behaviour blocking, checksumming,
access-control, integrity shell etc.); technical support etc. </P>

<P>One possible measure of a package's efficiency in terms of virus detection
is NCSA approval. Under the current testing protocol, a scanner must detect
all viruses on the Wild List plus 90% of NCSA's full test suite. </P>

<P>There is a growing tendency in the UK press to push InVircible as a
one-fits-all solution which renders known-virus scanning obsolete, while
Zvi Netiv and those who support his product have a tendency to promote
it by attacking the better-known scanners as being a security risk. While
my personal view is that there is a place for both known-virus scanning
and generic solutions, I would suggest reading a couple of papers which
take an opposing view before putting all your eggs in the InVircible basket.

are, I've heard, quoting 2-300 hundred. I don't know if these include every
minor variant, hypercard infectors, trojans and macro viruses, but I'll
try to find out. There are virtually no macro viruses which have a Mac-specific
payload, but every one I know of can infect on Macs (and any other platform
which runs Word 6.x or better). </P>

included in the freeware package Disinfectant, which can be obtained from

<H2>++ UNIX viruses?</H2>

<P>In general, there are virtually no non-experimental UNIX viruses. There
have been a few Worm incidents, most notably the Morris Worm (a.k.a. the
Internet Worm) of 1988. </P>

<P>There are products which scan some Unix systems for PC viruses, though
any machine used as a file server (Novell, Unix etc.) can be scanned for
PC viruses by a DOS scanner if it can be mounted as a logical drive on
a PC running appropriate network client software such as PC-NFS. </P>

<P>Intel-based PCs running Unix (e.g. Linux, 386BSD, SCO Unix etc.) can
also be infected by a DOS boot-sector virus if booted from an infected
disk. The same goes for other PC-hosted operating systems such as NetWare.
</P>

<P>While viruses are not a major risk on Unix platforms, integrity checkers
and audit packages are frequently used by system administrators to detect
file changes made by other kinds of attack. However, Unix security is outside
the scope of this FAQ (see comp.security.unix). </P>

<P>In fact, such packages generally target PC viruses more than the handful
of Unix viruses. </P>

<P>CyberSoft sell products for a number of Unix platforms which include
scanning (VFInd) and cryptographic integrity checking. Scanning includes
PC, Mac and Amiga viruses. </P>

<H2>Macro viruses?</H2>

<P>Macro viruses spread from files in applications which use macros capable
of being infected, and are limited to the specific applications for which
they were written. </P>

<P>The macro viruses which are receiving attention currently are specific
to Word 6/WordBasic and Excel: however, many applications, not all of them
Windows applications, have potentially damaging and/or infective macro
capabilities too. </P>

<P>One, now widespread, infects macros attached to Word 6.0 for Windows,
Word 6.0.1 for Macintosh, Word 6.0 for Windows NT, and Word for Windows
95 documents. </P>

<P>What makes such a virus possible is that the macros are created by WordBASIC,
a program language which links features used in Word to macros, and even
allows DOS commands to be run. </P>

<P>This virus, named &quot;Concept,&quot; has no destructive payload; it
merely spreads, after a document containing the virus is opened, copying
itself to other documents as they are saved, without affecting the contents
of documents. However, other macro viruses have been discovered, and some
of them contain destructive routines. </P>

<P>Microsoft suggests opening files without macros, to prevent macro viruses
from spreading, unless the user can verify that the macros contained in
the document will not cause damage. (This does NOT work for all macro viruses.)

<H2>The AOLgold virus</H2>

<P>This is actually a trojan. The following is extracted from the CIAC
bulletin (Number G-03). </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Apparently, an e-mail message is being circulated that contains an attached
archive file named AOLGOLD.ZIP. A README file that is in the archive describes
it as a new and improved interface for the AOL online service. Note that
there is no such program as AOLGOLD. Also, simply reading an e-mail message
or even downloading an included file will not do damage to your machine.
You must execute (or run) the downloaded file to release the Trojan and
have it cause damage. </P>

<P>If you unzip the archive, you get two files: INSTALL.EXE and README.TXT.
The README.TXT file again describes AOLGOLD as a new and improved interface
to the AOL online service. The INSTALL.EXE program is a self-extracting
ZIP archive. When you run the install program, it extracts 18 files onto
your hard drive. </P>

<P>The Trojan program is started by running the INSTALL.BAT file. The INSTALL.BAT
file is a simple batch file that renames the VIDEO.DRV file to VIRUS.BAT
and then runs it. VIDEO.DRV is an amateurish DOS batch file that starts
deleting the contents of several critical directories on your C: drive.
</P>

<P>When the batch file completes, it prints a crude message on the screen
and attempts to run a program named DoomDay.EXE. Bugs in the batch file
prevent the DOOMDAY.EXE program from running. Other bugs in the file cause
it to delete itself if it is run from any drive but the C: drive. The programming
style and bugs in the batch file indicates that the Trojan writer appears
to have little programming experience. </P>

Archive. </P>

<H2>++ the PKZip trojan virus?</H2>

<P>Most of us prefer to distinguish between trojans and viruses (see Part
1). The threat described in recent warnings is definitely not a virus,
since it doesn't replicate by infection. </P>

<P>There have been at least two attempts to pass off Trojans as an upgrade
to PKZip, the widely used file compression utility. A recent example was
of the files PKZ300.EXE and PKZ300B.ZIP made available for downloading
on the Internet. An earlier Trojan passed itself off as version 2.0. For
this reason, PKWare have never released a version 2.0 of PKZip: presumably,
if they ever do release another DOS version (unlikely, at this date, in
my opinion), it will not be numbered version 3.0(0). In fact, there are
hardly any known cases of someone downloading and being hit by this Trojan,
which few people have seen (though most reputable virus scanners will detect
it). As far as I know, this Trojan was only ever seen on warez servers
(specialising in pirated software). </P>

<P>There are recorded instances of a fake PKZIP vs. 3 found infected with
a real live in-the-wild file virus, but this too is very rare. To the best
of my knowledge, the latest version of PKZip is 2.04g, or 2.50 for Windows.</P>

<P>+++There was a version 2.06 put together specifically for IBM internal
use only (confirmed by PKWare). If you find it in circulation, avoid it.
It's either illicit or potentially damaging. </P>

<P>The recent rash of resuscitated warnings about this is at least in part
a hoax. It's not a virus, it's a trojan. It doesn't (and couldn't) damage
modems, V32 or otherwise, though I suppose a virus or trojan might alter
the settings of a modem - if it happened to be on and connected.... I don't
want to get into hypothetical arguments about programmable modems right
now. It appears to delete files, not destroy disks irrevocably. </P>

<P>It's certainly a good idea to avoid files claiming to be PKZip vs. 3,
but the real risk hardly justifies the bandwidth this alert has occupied
over the last year or so. </P>

<P>There <B>is</B> at least one file virus christened Good Times by the
individual who posted it in an attempt to cause confusion. It is more commonly
referred to as GT-spoof. </P>

<P>(2) There is no modem virus that spreads via an undocumented subcarrier
- whatever that means.... </P>

<P>(3) Any file virus can be transmitted as an E-mail attachment. However,
the virus code has to be executed before it actually infects. Sensibly
configured mailers don't usually allow this by default and without prompting,
but certainly some mailers can support this: for instance, cc:mail can,
it seems, launch attachments straight into AmiPro. </P>

<P>[further information on this or other potentially dangerous associations
would be gratefully received] </P>

<P>There's room for a lot of discussion here. The jury is still out on
web browsers: Netscape can certainly be set up to do things I don't approve
of, such as opening a Word document in Word without asking. </P>

<P>Microsoft have made available a Word viewer which reads Word files,
but doesn't run attached macros. If possible, use this instead. </P>

<P>The term 'ANSI bomb' usually refers to a mail message or other text
file that takes advantage of an 'enhancement' to the MS-DOS ANSI.SYS driver
which allows keys to be redefined with an escape sequence, in this case
to echo some potentially destructive command to the console. In fact, few
systems nowadays run programs which need ANSI terminal emulation to run,
and there's no guarantee that the program reading the file would pass such
an escape sequence unfiltered to the console anyway. There are plenty of
PD or shareware alternatives to ANSI.SYS that don't support keyboard redefinition,
or allow it to be turned off. </P>

<P>The term mail bomb is usually applied to the intentional bombardment
of an e-mail address with multiple copies of a (frequently abusive) message,
rather than to the above. </P>

<P>See SimTel/keyboard on sites carrying a SimTel mirror. </P>

<P>(4) There is no known way in which a virus could sensibly be spread
by a graphics file such as a JPEG or .GIF file, which does not contain
executable code. Macro viruses work because the files to which they are
attached are not 'pure' data files. </P>

<P>(5) In general, software cannot physically damage hardware - this includes
viruses. There is a possibility that specific hardware may be damaged by
specific code: however, a virus which drops a particular payload on the
offchance that it's running on a system with a particular type of obsolete
video card seems more than usually futile. </P>

<H2>(12) Favourite myths</H2>

<P><A NAME="ACV12a"></A></P>

<H3>DOS file attributes protect executable files from infection</H3>

<P>File attributes are set by software, and can therefore be changed by
software, including viruses. Many viruses reset a ReadOnly/System/Hidden
file to Read/Write, infect it, and often reset it to the original attributes
afterwards. </P>

<P>This also applies to other software mechanisms such as simulating hardware
write-protection on a hard disk. </P>

<P>However, file protection rights in NetWare <B>can</B> help to contain
virus infections, if set up properly, as can trustee rights. [Trustee assignments
govern whether an individual user has right of access to a subdirectory:
the Inherited Rights Mask governs the protection rights of individual files
and (sub)directories.] </P>

<P>Basically, a file virus has the same rights of access as the user who
happens to inadvertantly activate it. </P>

<P>Setting up these levels of security is really a function of the network
Administrator, but you might like to check (politely) that yours is not
only reassuringly paranoid but also knowledgeable about viruses as well
as networks, since a LAN which is not, in this respect, securely configured,
can result in very rapid infection and reinfection of files across the
whole LAN. In particular, accounts with supervisor equivalence can, potentially,
be the unwitting cause of very rapid dissemination of viruses. </P>

<H3>I'm safe from viruses because I don't use bulletin boards/shareware/
Public Domain software.</H3>

<P>Many of the most widely-spread viruses are Boot Sector Infectors, which
can't normally infect over a serial or network connection. Writers of shareware,
freeware etc. are no more prone to accidental infection than commercial
publishers, and possibly less. The only 'safe' PC is still in it's original
wrapping (which doesn't mean it isn't already infected...) And don't forget
that shrinkwrapped software may have been rewrapped. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV12c"></A></P>

<H3>FDISK /MBR fixes boot sector viruses.</H3>

<P>The mark II comp.virus FAQ is worth reading on this (see Part 1 of this
FAQ). </P>

<P>In brief, don't use FDISK /MBR <B>unless</B> you're <B>very</B> sure
of what you're doing, as you may lose data. Note also that if you set up
the drive with a disk manager such as EZDrive, you won't be able to access
the drive until and unless you can reinstall it. </P>

<H3>(i) What does FDISK /MBR do?</H3>

<P>It places &quot;clean&quot; partition code onto the partition of your
hard disk. It does **not change the partition information, however. The
/MBR command-line switch is not officially documented and was introduced
in DOS 5.0 </P>

<P>[It does sometimes, and when it does it us usually fatal (for the common
user, anyway). FDISK /MBR will wipe the partition table data if the last
two bytes of the MBR are not 55 AA.] </P>

<H3>(ii) What is the partition?</H3>

<P>The partition sector is the first sector on a hard disk. It contains
information about the disk such as the number of sectors in each partition,
where the DOS partition starts, plus a small program. The partition sector
is also called the &quot;Master Boot Record&quot; (MBR). </P>

<P>When a PC starts up it reads the partition sector and executes the code
it finds there. Viruses that use the partition sector modify this code.
</P>

<P>Since the partition sector is not part of the normal data storage part
of a disk, utilities such as DEBUG will not allow access to it. </P>

<P>[Unless one assembles into memory] </P>

<P>Floppy disks do not have a partition sector. </P>

<P>FDISK /MBR will change the code in a hard disk partition sector. </P>

<H3>(iii) What is a boot sector?</H3>

<P>The boot sector is the first sector on a floppy disk. On a hard disk
it is the first sector of a partition. It contains information about the
disk or partition, such as the number of sectors, plus a small program.
</P>

<P>When the PC starts up it attempts to read the boot sector of a disk
in drive A:. If this fails because there is no disk it reads the boot sector
of drive C:. A boot sector virus replaces this sector with its own code
and usually moves the original elsewhere on the disk. </P>

<P>Even a non-bootable floppy disk has executable code in its boot sector.
This displays the &quot;not bootable&quot; message when the computer attempts
to boot from the disk. Therefore, non-bootable floppies can still contain
a virus and infect a PC if it is inserted in drive A: when the PC starts
up. </P>

<P>FDISK /MBR will not change the code in a hard disk boot sector. Most
boot sector viruses infect the partition sector of hard disks and floppy
disk boot sectors: most do not infect the boot sector of a hard disk -
Form virus is an exception. </P>

<H3>(iv) How can I remove a virus from my hard disk's partition sector?</H3>

<P>There are two main alternatives: run an anti-virus product, or use FDISK
/MBR. </P>

<P>Most effective anti-virus products will be able to remove a virus from
a partition sector, but some have difficulties under certain circumstances.
In these cases the user may decide to use FDISK /MBR. </P>

<P>Unless you know precisely what you are doing this is unwise. You may
lose access to the data on your hard disk if the infection was done by
a virus such as Monkey or OneHalf. </P>

<H3>(v) Won't formatting the hard disk help?</H3>

<P>No. Formatting the hard disk can result in everything being wiped from
the drive <B>apart</B> from the virus. Format leaves the partition sector
untouched. There is always a better way of removing a virus infection than
formatting the hard disk. </P>

<P>[Clarification: FORMAT alters the DOS partition, but leaves the <B>partition
sector</B>, aka MBR, alone.] </P>

<H3>Write protecting suspect floppies stops infection.</H3>

<P>This sounds so silly I hesitate to include it. I've never seen it said
on a.c.v., but I've heard it so often in other contexts, I've included
it anyway. Write-protecting a suspect floppy will only protect that diskette
from <B>re-infection</B>, if it's already infected. It won't stop an infected
floppy from infecting other (write-enabled) drives. </P>

<P>If you boot with a disk in drive A which is infected with a boot-sector
virus, the fact that the diskette is write-protected will make no difference
at all. </P>

<P>Write-protecting a <B>clean</B> floppy will indeed prevent it from being
infected (but see below!). </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV12e"></A></P>

<H3>The write protect tab always stops a disk write</H3>

<P>Briefly, write protection is built into the hardware on the Mac and
on the PC (and most other systems, of course, but we can't cover everything),
and can't be circumvented in software. </P>

<P>However, it is possible for the hardware to fail: it's not common, but
it happens. Thus when I do a cleanup, I try to create a file on a sacrificial
floppy before risking my R/O boot disk. Sometimes, I even remember....
</P>

<P>Other caveats: a disk which you receive write-protected could have been
de-protected, infected, and re-protected. Even a 3.5&quot; disk with the
write-enable tab removed can be written to by covering the hole with (e.g.)
masking tape. And, of course, shrink-wrapped software could have been infected
before the duplication process. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV12f"></A></P>

<H3>I can infect my system by running DIR on an infected disk</H3>

<P>If you have a clean PC system, you can't contract a boot sector virus
<B>or</B> a file virus just by listing the files on an infected floppy.
Of course, if your PC is infected, you may well infect a <B>clean</B> floppy
by using </P>

<PRE>    DIR A:
</PRE>

<P>It <B>is</B> possible to have a scanner report a virus in memory after
a DIR of a floppy with an infected boot sector. The distinction here is
that the virus is <B>not</B> actually loaded into memory, so the PC has
<B>not</B> been infected. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV13"></A></P>

<H2>(13) What are the Legal Implications of Computer Viruses?</H2>

<P><B>The material in this section has no formal legal standing. It consists
of several persons' attempts to interpret and clarify the legal issues,
and cannot possibly be authoritative.</B> </P>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>It isn't possible to deal briefly with all the relevant legislation
in one country, let alone all of them. In the USA, local statutes may be
much more rigorous than federal legislation, which is, arguably, more concerned
with computers in which the government has an interest than it is with
those belonging to individuals. </P>

<P>In many countries, writing of viruses is not an offence in itself, whereas
in others, not only is this not the case, but distribution, even the sharing
of virus code between antivirus researchers is, at least technically, also
an offence. </P>

<P>Once a virus is released 'into the wild', it is likely to cross national
boundaries, making the writer and/or distributor answerable for his/her
actions under a foreign legal system, in a country he/she may never have
visited. </P>

<P>Where virus writing and distribution may not apply locally in a particular
case, the individual may nevertheless be subject to civil action: in other
words, where you may be held to have committed no offence, you may still
be sued for damage. </P>

<P>Some of the grounds on which virus writing or distribution may be found
to be illegal (obviously I'm not stating that all these grounds will apply
at all times in all states or countries!) include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Unauthorized access - you may be held to have obtained unauthorised
access to a computer you've never seen, if you are responsible for distribution
of a virus which infects that machine.</LI>

<LI>Unauthorized modification - this could be held to include an infected
file, boot sector, or partition sector.</LI>

<LI>Loss of data - this might include liability for accidental damage as
well as intentional disk/file trashing.</LI>

<LI>Endangering of public safety</LI>

<LI>Incitement (e.g. making available viruses, virus code, information
on writing viruses, and virus engines)</LI>

<LI>Denial of service</LI>

<LI>Application of any of the above with reference to computer systems
or data in which the relevant government has an interest.</LI>
</UL>

<P>One major problem is that some residents of the United States firmly
believe that U.S. law is universal law. Worse, most of them have limited
knowledge of their own legal system, but this may apply to the citizens
of many countries. The idea that a person can be acquitted of a criminal
offence yet still lose a civil suit in connection with that same offence
strikes most laymen as preposterous, yet it does happen in both Canada
and the U.S., at least. </P>

<P>Since the law does vary widely from country to country (and even within
countries), it is entirely possible for one to break the law of another
country, state, province, or whatever, without ever leaving your own, and
since extradition treaties do exist, perhaps it's best to assume that any
act that might be construed as being or causing wilful and malicious damage
to a computer or computer system could get you a roommate with undesirable
tendencies and no social graces. :) </P>

<P>The best advice to give to any one contemplating a possibly illegal
act would be to contact their local Crown Prosecutor, Crown Attorney, District
Attorney, or whatever label the local government prosecutor wears. Acting
on the advice of one's own attorney doesn't render one immune from prosecution,
and the cost of defence can be high, even if successful. </P>

<P>An extremely biased opinion is that very often attorneys attempt to
provide the answer they believe the client wishes to hear, or give an opinion
in areas where they have no real expertise. Prosecutors, on the other hand,
tend to look at a particular action in the light of whether a successful
prosecution can be mounted. If the local Crown Prosecutor were to suggest
that something was a Bad Thing, I should be extremely nervous about doing
it. :) </P>

<H3>USA &amp; Canada</H3>

<P>The following is an interpretation of the laws in the USA and Canada,
and has no legal standing as an authoritative document in those countries
or any other. Relevant legislation in other parts of the world may be very
different and in some cases far stricter. </P>

<P>Many thanks to David J. Loundy for his assistance with the legalities
regarding computer crime. A valuable source of information on this topic
can be found in his E-Law paper, which can be accessed via the URL: </P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="http://www.leepfrog.com/E-Law/E-Law/Part_VII.html">http://www.leepfrog.com/E-Law/E-Law/Part_VII.html</A><BR>

<P>It is illegal in both the USA and Canada to damage data within a computer
system which is used or operated by the government. This means that if
you write a virus, and it eventually infects a government system (highly
probable), you are in violation of the law. Inclusive in this category
are damages incurred due to computer stoppages (i.e. writing a virus that
causes a computer to crash or become unusable), and viruses that destroy
data. </P>

<P>The question regarding the writing of malevolent computer viruses being
illegal isn't really that hard to answer: It is illegal to write and spread
a virus that infects a government system. Federal law is unclear as to
whether this extends to private computer systems as well, but State statutes
are frequently unequivocal about defining virus-related crimes against
property. </P>

<P>The question has come up, however, about the distribution of viruses
and virus-related programs. A general guideline is that it is legal to
distribute viruses, for example, on a BBS, as long as the people who are
downloading the virus know EXACTLY what they are getting. If you intentionally
infect a file and make it available for downloading, you may be subject
to prosecution. Your conscience should be your guide in this kind of a
situation. If a virus distributed by you is used to damage or otherwise
modify a major system, you can be held accountable. </P>

<P>The reason that the explanations in this section are vague is that the
laws in various states, provinces, etc., are different, and you should
check with your local police before you decide you want to distribute viruses.
</P>

<P>If you spread a virus unknowingly, you generally cannot be prosecuted
unless it can be proven that you spread the virus due to pure carelessness.
The definition of carelessness has not been tested in a court of law, as
far as I know at the date of writing (9/22/95) </P>

<H3>The UK</H3>

<P>In the UK, the Computer Misuse Act makes it a crime to make an unauthorised
modification on a computer. If you own a computer, you can authorise anything
you want for that computer, so you can spread a virus on a computer you
own. A virus makes a modification, so if someone deliberately spreads a
virus on someone else's computer, that's a crime. Giving a virus to someone
else isn't a crime if it's with his/her knowledge and permission, however.
So, sending a diskette with a virus on to an AV company, together with
a note saying &quot;There's a virus on this disk, please investigate it
for me&quot; is legal. </P>

<P>If an action is a crime, then encouraging that action can also be a
crime (&quot;incitement&quot;). </P>

<P>If you spread a virus unwittingly, then it isn't a crime, as you don't
have &quot;intent&quot;. </P>

<P>If someone is negligent, and so spreads a virus (even unwittingly),
then there could be a civil action for damages through negligence. </P>

<H3>The Canadian Criminal Code</H3>

<P>Please bear in mind that the following information was culled from the
Criminal Code in 1993 and those sections may have been expanded or revised
since then, or possibly some computer-specific legislation may have been
enacted of which I am unaware. </P>

<P>No mention is made in the Code (as of 1993) of computer viruses as such,
but it would seem that prosecution under Sec. 430 would be appropriate.
</P>

<P>Quoting from the Code:- </P>

<PRE>Section 342.1

    (1)  Every one who, fraudulently and without color of right,

      (a) obtains, directly or indirectly, any computer service,

      (b) by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or

      directly or indirectly, any function of a computer system, or

      (c) uses or causes to be used, directly or indirectly, a
      computer system with intent to commit an offence under
      paragraph (a) or (b) or an offence under section 430 in
      relation to data or a computer system

is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding ten years, or is guilty of an offence punishable
on summary conviction.

    (2)  In this section,

&quot;computer program&quot; means data representing instructions or statements
that, when executed in a computer system, causes the computer system
to perform a function;

&quot;computer service&quot; includes data processing and the storage or
retrieval of data;

<P>Apparently the laws governing trespass have not been considered as having
any application in cyberspace. Offenders under the above section would
be charged with mischief, which covers a multitude of sins under Canadian
law. The penalties stipulated in Sec. 342.1 are the same as the penalties
for sabotage, just as a point of interest. </P>

<P>Mischief is covered by Sec. 430:- </P>

<PRE>Section 430

    (1)  Every one commits mischief who wilfully

      (a) destroys or damages property;

      (b) renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or
      ineffective;

      (c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use,
      enjoyment or operation of property, or

      (d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in
      the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property.


    (1.1)  Every one commits mischief who wilfully

      (a) destroys or alters data;

      (b) renders data meaningless, useless or ineffective;

      (c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use
      of data; or

      (d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in
      the lawful use of data or denies access to data to any person
      who is entitled to access thereto.


    (2)  Every one who commits mischief that causes actual danger
to life is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
for life.


    (3)  Every one who commits mischief in relation to property
that is a testamentary instrument or the value of which exceeds one
thousand dollars

      (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
      imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or

      (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.


    (4)  Every one who commits mischief in relation to property,
other than property described in subsection (3),

      (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable for
      imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or

      (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.


    (5)  Every one who commits mischief in relation to data

      (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
      imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or

      (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.


    (5.1)  Every one who wilfully does an act or wilfully omits
to do an act that it is his duty to do, if that act or omission is
likely to constitute mischief causing actual danger to life, or to
constitute mischief in relation to property or data,

      (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
      imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or

      (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.


    (6)  No person commits mischief within the meaning of this
section by reason only that

      (a) he stops work as a result of the failure of his employer
      and himself to agree on any matter relating to his
      employment;

      (b) he stops work as a result of his employer and a
      bargaining agent acting on his behalf to agree on any matter
      relating to his employment; or

      (c) he stops work as a result of his taking part in a
      combination of workmen or employees for their own reasonable
      protection as workmen or employees.


    (7)  No person commits mischief within the meaning of this
section by reason that he attends at or near or approaches a
dwelling-house or place for the purpose only of obtaining or
communicating information.


    (8)  In this section, &quot;data&quot; has the same meaning as in
section 342.1.
</PRE>

<CENTER><P>-------------- End of Sec. 430 ----------------- </P></CENTER>

<P>For the record, from Sec. 785:- </P>

<PRE>Section 785 (1)

&quot;summary conviction court&quot; means a person who has jurisdiction in the
territorial division where the subject-matter of the proceedings is
alleged to have arisen and who

      (a) is given jurisdiction over the proceedings by the
      enactment under which the proceedings are taken,

      (b) is a justice or provincial court judge, where the
      enactment under which the proceedings are taken does not
      expressly give jurisdiction to any person or class of
      persons, or

      (c) is a provincial court judge, where the enactment under
      which the proceedings are taken gives jurisdiction in respect
      thereof to two or more justices;


To the best of my limited knowledge, the Canadian Criminal Code only
uses the term &quot;incitement&quot; in Sec. 319 (Public incitement of hatred)
and Sec. 53 (incitement to commit a traitorous or mutinous act).

A prosecutor would probably deal with incitement under Sec. 21
(Parties to offence), Sec. 463 (Attempts), or Sec. 465 (Conspiracy).


Section 21

    (1)  Every one is a party to an offence who

      (a) actually commits it;

      (b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
      any person to commit it; or

      (c) abets any person in committing it.


    (2)  Where two or more persons form an intention in common to
carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and
any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying
out the common purpose is a party to that offence.
</PRE>

<CENTER><P>--------------- End of Sec. 21 ------------------ </P></CENTER>

<P>&quot;Incite&quot; does get mentioned in Sec. 22:- </P>

<PRE>Section 22

    (1)  Where a person counsels another person to be a party to
an offence and that other person is afterwards a party to that
offence, the person who counselled is a party to that offence,
notwithstanding that the offence was committed in a way different
from that which was counselled.


    (2)  Every one who counsels another person to be a party to
an offence is a party to every offence that the other commits in
consequence of the counselling that the person who counselled knew or
ought to have known was likely to be committed in consequence of the
counselling.


    (3)  For the purpose of this Act, &quot;counsel&quot; includes procure,
solicit or incite.
</PRE>

<CENTER><P>-------------- End of Sec. 22 ------------------- </P></CENTER>

<P>Section 23 deals with an accessory after the fact, and I've already
quoted too much, and more to come, but Sections 23.1 and 24 are interesting.....
</P>

<PRE>Section 23.1

    For greater certainty, sections 21 to 23 apply in respect of
an accused notwithstanding the fact that the person whom the accused
aids or abets, counsels or procures or receives, comforts or assists
cannot be convicted of the offence.


Section 24

    (1)  Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence,
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out the
intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or
not it was possible under to circumstances to commit the offence.


    (2)  The question whether an act or omission by a person who
has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to
commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit
the offence, is a question of law.
</PRE>

<CENTER><P>-------------- End of Sec. 23.1 and 24 ---------- </P></CENTER>

<P>Under Sec. 465 (1)(c) and 465 (1)(d), conspiring to commit an offence
carries the same penalties as the actual commission of the crime. </P>

<P>Under certain circumstances, laws in other countries may be applicable
in cyberspace, where there are no formal territorial boundaries. For instance,
Sec. 465 (4) of the Canadian Criminal Code stipulates that every one, &quot;while
in a place outside Canada&quot; conspires to commit an offence in Canada
&quot;shall be deemed to have conspired in Canada to do that thing.&quot;

antivirus packages which are already mature, and unless you have a distinctly

<P>If you want to test anti-virus software with live viruses, this is <B>not</B>

<P>Valid testing of antivirus software requires a lot of time, care and
thought and a valid virus test-set. Virus simulators are unhelpful in this
context: a scanner which reports a virus when it finds one of these is
actually false-alarming, which isn't necessarily what you want from a scanner.

<H2>It said in a review....</H2>

<P>Reviews in the general computing press are rarely useful. Most journalists
don't have the resources or the knowledge to match the quality of the reviews
available in specialist periodicals like Virus Bulletin or Secure Computing.
Of course, it's possible to produce a useful, if limited assessment of
a package without using live viruses based on good knowledge of the issues
involved (whether the package is NCSA-certified, for instance): unfortunately,
most journalists are unaware of how little they know and have a vested
interest in giving the impression that they know much more than they do.
Even more knowledgeable writers may not make clear the criteria applied
in their review. </P>

<H2>Is it viruses, virii or what?</H2>

<P>The Latin root of virus has no plural form. Since the use of the word
virus is borrowed from biology, you might like to conform to the usage
normally favoured by biologists, doctors etc., which is viruses. However,
a number of people favour the terms virii/viri, either to avoid confusion
with the biological phenomenon (but what's the point of distinguishing
in the plural but not in the singular?), or to avoid being mistaken for
anti-virus researchers..... </P>

<H2>What about firewalls?</H2>

<P>Firewalls don't generally screen computer viruses, though version 3
of Checkpoint's Firewall-1 can use a plug-in scanning module based on Computing
Associates/Cheyenne's Innoculan engine. However, there are a number of
products that scan for viruses at a point either before or after a &quot;normal&quot;
firewall to the Internet (or internally between post offices.) These products
can scan incoming and outgoing E-mail attachments for viruses. MIMESweeper,
by Integralis, uses your favourite scanner (e.g. F-PROT, Thunderbyte, Dr.
Solomon's, Sophos, etc) for scanning the viruses after it has opened up
the E-Mail attachments in a secure area on the hard drive of the NT machine.
Obviously, the on-demand scanner is an additional cost. </P>

<P>The use of a &quot;batch&quot; file allows the scanning to use any switches
or commands that are available to the scanner program(s) and also allows
multiple scanners to be used with different switches, etc. which it runs.
If clean, it sends the E-Mail on. Files which it cannot scan can be 'quarantined'
in the secure area to be scanned 'by hand' or otherwise disposed of. </P>

<P>MIMESweeper vs. 1.0 reads MIME attachments and recognises ZIP archives,
but does not read other compression formats or binary encoding formats
such as uuencode. </P>

<P>MIMESweeper ver. 2.1 reads MIME attachments, UUENCODE, and recognises
ZIP and recursive .ZIP archives, OLE, but does not yet read many other
compression or binary encoding formats. (CDA, BinHex, LHA and Stuffit are
expected shortly). It runs under NT Workstation and requires, as minimum,
a 486 with 24Mb RAM, 500Mb hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive (for installation
only). It works with cc:Mail, SMTP with MIME attachments, Microsoft Mail,
or MHS, and is said to be usable as a filter for other material as well
as file viruses such as trojans. (MIMEsweeper will be adding FTP and HTTP
later). </P>

<P>MIMESweeper 3.0 adds FTP/HTTP but not NNTP. Minimum requirement is still
a 486 with 24Mb, but medium to high volumes will require a Pentium with
32Mb RAM. WEBSweeper requires NT version 4.0 (apply Service Pack 4 if accessed
via NetWare). MIMESweeper requires TCP/IP for remote management</P>

<P>MIMESweeper has advanced content filtering abilities which go beyond
its capabilities (with assistance from other software) for detection of
file viruses and trojans. </P>

<P>Trend's InterScan VirusWall is similar to MIMEsweeper but uses Trend's
own scanning engine only as the scanner. Trend also scans FTP traffic.
Trend currently runs on SUN Solaris 2.4-5 and will be adding NT later.
</P>

<P>These products do real scanning before the mail hits the hard drive
but, at least until the holes are filled in the above products, make sure
your mail attachments, WWW downloads etc. can't be automatically executed
and use a good TSR/VXD in combination with a good scanner. Note that scanning
FTP traffic is likely to add a heavy network overhead and probably won't
catch as many viruses as checking <B>all</B> files from <B>all</B> sources
with a desktop scanner.</P>

<P>Current informed thinking tends to be that detection of viruses at the
firewall is acceptable (1) if you can afford the additional hardware, software
and latency (processing overhead), not to mention the hidden administrative
overheads of configuration and policy for dealing with boundary conditions
such as unusual 7-bit encoding formats, encrypted files etc. (2) ss long
as you appreciate that it can only be supplementary to checking at the
desktop, not a replacement. Mail attachments, FTP and HTTP are more significant
vectors for virus transmission than formerly, especially with the near-exponential
boom in macro viruses, but other vectors (especially floppy disks) are
still of vital concern. System administrators are attracted by the fact
that it's easier to update server software than control the use of scanning
on individual workstations, but the fact remains that in most environments,
until the desktop is adequately protected with good, up-to-date realtime
(on-access) scanning and/or scheduled on-demand scanning, virus scanning
at the perimeter is a semi-irrelevance. </P>

<P>McAfee's WebScan also addresses this market, but has detection only,
not disinfection: you need their on-demand scanner too. Dr. Solomon's MailGuard
is based on MIMESweeper. Norton AntiVirus for Firewalls is due for release
in June 1997. </P>

<H2>Viruses on CD-ROM</H2>

<P>Viruses have been distributed on CD ROM (for instance, Microsoft shipped
Concept, the first (in the wild) macro virus, on a CD ROM called &quot;Windows
95 Software Compatability Test&quot; in 1995). It is wise to scan CD ROMs
on arrival for viruses, just like floppies. If the CD ROM has compressed
or archived files it is wise to scan it with an anti-virus package which
can cope with large amounts of compressed and archived files. </P>

<P>[If you scan all drives at every boot, though, you may find that this
gives you a good incentive to remove CDs from your CD drive before you
power down, especially if your scanner isn't set to allow you to break
out of a scan. B-)] </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV14j"></A></P>

<H2>Removing viruses</H2>

<P>It is always better from a security point of view to replace infected
files with clean, uninfected copies. However, in some circumstances this
is not convenient. For example, if an entire network were infected with
a fast-infecting file virus then it may be a lot quicker to run a quick
repair with a reliable anti-virus product than to find clean, backup copies
of the files. It should also be realised that clean backups are not available.
If a site has been hit by Nomenklatura, for example, it may take a long
time before it is realised that you have been infected. By that time the
data in backups has been seriously compromised. </P>

<P>There are virtually no circumstances under which you should need to
reformat a hard disk, however: in general, this is an attempt to treat
the symptom instead of the cause. Likewise re-partitioning with FDISK.
</P>

<P>If you use a generic low-level format program, i.e. one which isn't
specifically for the make and model of drive you actually own, you stand
a good chance of trashing the drive more thoroughly than any virus yet
discovered. </P>

<H2>Can't viruses sometimes be useful?</H2>

<P>Vesselin Bontchev wrote a respected paper on this subject: </P>

<P>Fred Cohen has done some heavy-duty writing in the other direction.
Start with &quot;A Short Course on Computer Viruses&quot;, &quot;It's Alive!&quot;(Wiley).
</P>

<P>In general, it's hard to imagine a situation where (e.g.) a maintenance
virus is the <B>only</B> option. I have yet to see a convincing example
of a potentially useful virus which <B>needs</B> to be a virus. Such a
program would have to be <B>much</B> better written and error-trapped than
viruses usually are. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV14l"></A></P>

<H2>Do I have a virus, and how do I know?</H2>

<P>Almost anything odd a computer may do can (and has been) blamed on a
computer &quot;virus,&quot; especially if no other explanation can readily
be found. In most cases, when an anti-virus program is then run, no virus
is found. </P>

<P>A computer virus can cause unusual screen displays, or messages - but
most don't do that. A virus may slow the operation of the computer - but
many times that doesn't happen. Even longer disk activity, or strange hardware
behaviour can be caused by legitimate software, harmless &quot;prank&quot;
programs, or by hardware faults. A virus may cause a drive to be accessed
unexpectedly (and the drive light to go on) - but legitimate programs can
do that also. </P>

<P>One usually reliable indicator of a virus infection is a change in the
length of executable (*.com/*.exe) files, a change in their content, or
a change in their file date/time in the Directory listing. But some viruses
don't infect files, and some of those which do can avoid showing changes
they've made to files, especially if they're active in RAM. </P>

<P>Another common indication of a virus infection is a change to interrupt
vectors or the reassignment of system resources. Unaccounted use of memory
or a reduction in the amount normally shown for the system may be significant.
</P>

<P>In short, observing &quot;something funny&quot; and blaming it on a
computer virus is less productive than scanning regularly for potential
viruses, and not scanning, because &quot;everything is running OK&quot;
is equally inadvisable. </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV14m"></A></P>

<H2>What should be on a (clean) boot disk?</H2>

<P>A boot floppy is one which contains the basic operating system, so that
if the hard disk becomes inaccessible, you can still boot the machine to
attempt some repairs. NB All formatted floppies contain a boot sector,
but only floppies which contain the necessary system files can be used
as boot floppies. A clean boot disk is one which is known not to be virus-infected.
It's best to use a clean boot disk before routine scans of your hard disk(s).
Some antivirus packages will refuse to run if there is a virus in memory.
It is usually better and sometimes mandatory to disinfect a system without
the virus in memory, and an undetected file virus may actually spread faster
during a scan, since scanners normally open all executable files in all
directories. </P>

<P>To make an emergency bootable floppy disk, put a disk in drive A and
type </P>

<PRE>    FORMAT A: /S
</PRE>

<P>Be careful to avoid 'cross-formatting', i.e. formatting a double-density
disk as high-density or vice versa, if you system allows this. (You should
avoid this all the time, not just when creating a boot disk. I'd also recommend
avoiding single-density and quad-density disks, and there may be problems
writing to double-density 5.25&quot; disks on a different machine to the
one on which they were formatted, if one machine is an XT and the other
an AT or better.) </P>

<P>You can also make a pre-formatted floppy into a boot disk by typing
</P>

<PRE>    SYS A:
</PRE>

<P>I'd suggest you also COPY these commands from C:\DOS to it: ATTRIB,
CHKDSK (or SCANDISK if you have DOS6), FDISK, FORMAT, SYS, and BACKUP and
RESTORE (or whatever backup program you use, if it will fit). They may
come in handy if you can't access the hard disk, or it won't boot up. </P>

<P>You may be aware that if there is a problem with your boot sequence,
you can boot from the hard disk on a DOS 6/7/Win95 system while bypassing
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. This is not as good as a clean floppy boot:
it won't help at all if you have a boot sector/partition sector infector,
or if any or all of the basic operating system files have been infected
by a file virus. </P>

<P>The boot disk should have been created with the same version of DOS
as you have on your hard disk. It should also include any drivers necessary
to access your hard disk and other device. If, for some reason, you can't
obtain a clean boot disk with the same version of DOS, you can often get
away with booting from a (clean) disk using a different version, though:
indeed, there are viruses which exploit a bug in recent versions of MS-DOS
which will prevent a clean boot from DOS vs. 4-6. If you <B>do</B> use
a different version, remember that you won't be able to use many of the
standard DOS system utilities on the hard disk, which will simply return
a message like 'Wrong DOS version' when you try to run them, and avoid
the use of FORMAT or FDISK. </P>

<P>If you become virus-infected it can be very helpful to have backup of
your hard disk's boot sector and partition sector (also known as MBR).
Some anti-virus and disk utilities can do this. Other useful tools to include
are a small DOS-based text editor (for editing AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS
and so forth), a copy of the DOS commands COMP or FC (for comparing files),
FDISK and SYS (make sure they are from the same version of DOS as you are
booting). There is a school of thought that your boot disk should also
include your anti-virus software. The problem with this is that anti-virus
software should be updated frequently, and you may forget to update (and
re-write-protect) your boot disk each time. Ideally you will have been
sent a clean, write-protected copy of the latest version of your anti-virus
software by your vendor/supplier. </P>

<P>If you want to use the DOS program EDIT, remember that you need both
EDIT.* and QBASIC.* on the same disk. </P>

<P>When you have everything you need on your boot floppy and any supplementary
floppies (see below), make sure they're all <B>write-protected</B>! </P>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV14n"></A></P>

<H2>How do I know I have a clean boot disk?</H2>

<P>You can't usually make up a clean boot disk on a system which has been
booted from an infected floppy or hard disk. So how do you know you're
booting clean? Actually, you can never be 100% sure. If you buy a PC with
the system already installed, you can't be sure the supplier didn't format
it with an infected disk. If you get a set of system disks, can you assume
that Microsoft or the disk duplicator didn't somehow release a contaminated
disk image? (Yes, something rather like this has indeed happened...) However,
you can be better than 99% sure. </P>

<UL>
<LI>If you have (and use) a reputable, up-to-date virus scanner, it will
almost invariably detect a known virus in memory (scanners can't be relied
on to detect an unknown virus, in memory or not). If a good scanner doesn't
ring an alarm bell, you've <B>almost</B> certainly booted clean. What constitutes
a good scanner is another question....</LI>

<LI>If you have a set of original system disks which you received shrinkwrapped
<B>and</B> which you've never used <B>or</B> which have only been used
write-protected, you can probably use Disk 1 as a boot disk and it <B>probably</B>
isn't infected - after all, Microsoft doesn't use MSAV for jobs like this.....
It has been reported, though, that DOS systems disks have been distributed
infected, and the fact that they're often distributed write-enabled doesn't
inspire confidence.</LI>

<LI>You could always contact the supplier of your most-trusted anti-virus
utility and ask whether you can send them a boot floppy to check. Of course,
even anti-virus gurus sometimes make mistakes, but a boot disk verified
in this way would still be worth paying for, especially for organizations
with mission-critical systems.</LI>

<LI>S&amp;S are now distributing a 'Magic Bullet' disk with future versions
of their Dr. Solomon product, which will boot a PC with just enough functionality
to enable users to run their scanning software without infringing Microsoft's
copyright (as they would be doing if they distributed a boot-able DOS floppy).
This strikes me as an excellent idea, though it won't work on every system.</LI>

<LI>When the unit I work for approached Microsoft to check on the legal
position as regards distributing a clean boot disk with anti-virus software
updates within the organization, we were told that this was OK as long
as the boot floppy was made with the same version of DOS as the version
on the target machine. Any organization wishing to do this might like to
check with Microsoft that this is still their formal position.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR><A NAME="ACV14o"></A></P>

<H2>What other tools might I need?</H2>

<P>Other suggestions have included a sector editor, and Norton Utilities
components such as Disk Doctor (NDD). These are not suitable for use by
the technically-challenged - any tool which can manipulate disks at a low-level
is potentially dangerous. If you do use tools like this, make sure they're
good quality and up-to-date. If you attack a 1Gb disk with a package that
thinks 32Mb is the maximum for a partition and MFM disk controllers are
leading edge, you're in for trouble.... </P>

<P>A copy of PKZIP/PKUNZIP or similar compression/decompression utility
may be useful both for retrieving data and for cleaning (some) stealth
viruses. The MSD diagnostic tool supplied with recent versions of DOS and
Windows is a useful addition. QEMM includes a useful diagnostic tool called
Manifest. Heavy duty diagnostic packages like CheckIt! may be of use. There
are some useful shareware/freeware diagnostic packages, too. </P>

<P>Obviously, these are not all going to go on one bootdisk. When you prepare
a toolkit like this, make sure <B>all</B> the disks are write-protected!
</P>

<P>Tech support types are likely to find that an assortment of bootable
disks including various versions of DOS comes in useful on occasion. If
you have one or two non-Microsoft DOS versions (DR-DOS/Novell DOS or PC-DOS),
they can be a useful addition. DoubleSpaced or similar drives will need
DOS 6.x; Stacked drives will need appropriate drivers loaded. </P>

<P>My understanding of the copyright position is that Microsoft does not
encourage you to <B>distribute</B> bootable disks (even if they contain
only enough files to minimally boot the system) <B>unless</B> the target
system is loaded with the same version of MS-DOS as the boot floppy. Support
engineers will need to ensure that they are legally entitled to all DOS
versions for which they have bootable disks. </P>

<H2>What are rescue disks?</H2>

<P>Many antivirus and disk repair utilities can make up a (usually bootable)
rescue disk for a specific system. This needs a certain amount of care
and maintenance, especially if you make up more than one of these for a
single PC with more than one utility. Make sure you update <B>all</B> your
rescue disks when you make a significant change, and that you understand
what a rescue disk does and how it does it before you try to use it. Don't

<H2>Are there CMOS viruses?</H2>

<P>Although a virus (e.g. antiCMOS) CAN write to (and corrupt) a PC's CMOS
memory, it can NOT &quot;hide&quot; there. The CMOS memory used for system
information (and backed up by battery power) is not &quot;addressable,&quot;
and requires Input/Output (&quot;I/O&quot;) instructions to be usable.
</P>

<P>Data stored there are not loaded from there and executed, so virus code
written to CMOS memory would still need to infect an executable program
in order to load and execute whatever it wrote. </P>

<P>A virus could use CMOS memory to store part of its code, and some tamper
with the CMOS Setup's values. However, executable code stored there must
first be first moved to DOS memory in order to be executed. Therefore,
a virus can NOT spread from, or be hidden in CMOS memory. </P>

<P><B>++</B> There are also reports of a trojanized AMI BIOS - this is
not a virus, but a 'joke' program which does not replicate. The malicious
program is not on the disk, nor in CMOS, but was directly coded into the
BIOS ROM chip on the system board. by a rogue programmer at American Megatrends
Inc., the manufacturers. </P>

<P><B>++</B> If the date is 13th of November, it stops the bootup process
and plays 'Happy Birthday' through the PC speaker. In this case, the only
cure is a new BIOS (or motherboard) - contact your dealer. The trojanized
chip run was BIOS version M82C498 Evaluation BIOS vs. 1.55 of 04-04-93,
according to <A HREF="epnotvir.htm">Jimmy Kuo's &quot;What is NOT a virus&quot;
paper</A>. </P>

<P><B>++</B> From time to time there are reports from Mac users that the
message 'welcome datacomp' appears in their documents without having been
typed. This appears to be the result of using a trojanised 3rd-party Mac-compatible
keyboard with this 'joke' hard-coded into the keyboard ROM. It's not a
virus - it can't infect anything - and the only cure is to replace the
keyboard. </P>

<H2>How do I know I'm FTP-ing 'good' software?</H2>

<P>Reputable sites like SimTel and Garbo check uploaded utilities for viruses
before making them publicly available. However, it makes sense not to take
anything for granted. I'm aware of at least one instance of a virus-infected
file being found on a SimTel mirror: you can't scan a newly-uploaded file
for a virus your scanner doesn't know about. Good A/V packages include
self-checking code, though it's unsafe to depend even on this 100%. Be
paranoid: you know it makes sense.... </P>

<P>In general, don't run <B>anything</B> downloaded from the Internet,

<H2>What is 386SPART.PAR?</H2>

<P>People are sometimes alarmed at finding they have a hidden file with
this name. It is, in fact, created by Windows 3.x when you configure it
to use a permanent swap file (a way of allowing Windows to work as if you
had more memory than you really do. On no account should you delete it,
as it will upset your configuration. If you wish to remove it or adjust
the size, do so via the 386 Enhanced setting in Control Panel. However,
a permanent swap file usually improves performance on a machine with relatively
little memory. The file is not executable as such, and reports of virus

<H2>Can I get a virus to test my antivirus package with?</H2>

<P>Well, I won't send you one... Most packages have some means of allowing
you to trigger a test alert. There is a standard EICAR test file which
is recognized by some packages. </P>

<P>George Wenzel recently reported that recent versions of the following
should recognise it. Well done George for promoting the EICAR file among
vendors who hadn't been taking notice! </P>

</P>
</UL>

<P>To make use of the EICAR test string, type or copy/paste the following
text into a file called EICAR.COM, or TEST.COM or whatever. </P>

<PRE>    X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</PRE>

<P>Running the file displays the text &quot;EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!&quot;.
</P>

<P>Scanning the file with one of the components of these packages should
trigger an alert. </P>

<P>The EICAR file isn't an indication of a scanner's -efficiency- at detecting
viruses, since (1) it isn't a virus and (2) detecting a single virus or
non-virus isn't a useful test of the number of viruses detected. It's a
(limited) check on whether the program is installed, but I'm not sure it's
a measure of whether it's installed correctly. For instance, the fact that
a scanner reports correctly that a file called EICAR.COM contains the EICAR
string, doesn't tell you whether it will detect macro viruses, for example.
In fact, if I wanted to be really picky, I'd have to say that it doesn't
actually tell you anything except that the scanner detects the EICAR string
in files with a particular extension. </P>

<P>[I have Chengi Jimmy Kuo's permission to reproduce the following, a
propos of the preceding paragraph]:</P>

<P>&quot;The purpose of the EICAR test file is for the user to test all
the bells and whistles associated with detecting a virus. And, if given
that one platform detects it, is everything else working? It is to enable
such things as: </P>

<P>Is the alert system working correctly? </P>

<UL>
<P>Does the beeper work? <BR>
Does the network alert work?</P>
</UL>

<P>Does it log correctly? <BR>
What does it say?</P>

<P>Is the NLM working? For inbound? For outbound? <BR>
Is compressed file scanning working?</P>

<P>Surprise MIS testing of AV security placements.</P>

<P>The file serves no purpose in testing whether one product is better
than another. Previously, every product had to supply its own test methods.
This allows for an independent standard.'</P>

<P>There have been long threads recently on whether the Rosenthal Simulator
is useful for this sort of job. This will be considered at length here
when I have the time to look at it in more detail, but it should be noted
that many anti-virus researchers have expressed considerable scepticism.
Certainly, having looked at an earlier incarnation, I see no urgent need
to research this further. </P>

<H2>When I do DIR | MORE I see a couple of files with funny names...</H2>

<P>Actually, this is in the Virus-L FAQ. Read that and post the question
to comp.virus or alt.comp.virus if you're still worried. Basically, the
answer is that MORE creates a couple of temporary files, being considerably
less efficient than the Unix utility it attempts to emulate. Most versions
of DOS since the Middle Ages support the syntax DIR /P, which does the
same job less messily. In fact, if you have a version of DOS later than
5, you might consider incorporating it into the environment variable DIRCMD,
so that it becomes your default on directory listings which exceed 1 screenful.
</P>

<P>Of course, other utilities such as ATTRIB can also be filtered through
MORE like this, which may result in similar symptoms. </P>

<H2>Reasons NOT to use FDISK /MBR</H2>

<P>See Section 12 in part 2 of this FAQ for further information about FDISK
with the undocumented /MBR switch. However, people with virus problems
are frequently advised, out of ignorance or maliciousness, to use this
switch in circumstances where it can lead to an inability to access your
disk drive and possible loss of data (not to mention hair and sanity).
</P>

<P>Essentially, you should avoid using FDISK /MBR unless you have it on
good authority that it's safe and necessary to do so. In most circumstances,
it's safer to clean a partition sector with a good anti-virus program.
</P>

<P>You should avoid FDISK /MBR at all costs under the following circumstances:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Under an infection of viruses that don't preserve the Partition Table
e.g., Monkey, reported at 7.2% of the infections reported to <I>Virus Bulletin</I>
for December '95, the last report for which I have data</LI>

<LI>Under an infection that encrypts data on the hard drive and keeps the
key in the MBR, e.g, One_half -- reported at 0.8% worldwide</LI>

<LI>When security software, e.g., PC-DACS is in use</LI>

<LI>When a driver like Disk Manager or EZDrive is installed</LI>

<LI>When a controller that stores data in (0,0,1) is in use</LI>

<LI>When more than one BSI virus is active, in some conditions</LI>

<LI>When a data diddler is active, e.g. Ripper, accountable for 3.8% of
the infections reported in the study cited above (N.B.: while this case
won't be fixed by AV utilities, at least one will know why there are problems
with the drive) </LI>

<H2>Where can I get an anti-virus policy?</H2>

<P>There is some relevant material in the Virus-L FAQ document, but you'll
need to do most of the work specific to your own environment. It's worth
doing some general reading on security policies generally and getting the
distinctions straight between policies, strategies, standards, procedures
and protocols. I'm working on this in other contexts: some of that material
may eventually seep back into here. </P>

<P>The NCSA have a Corporate Virus Prevention Policy disk/document which
can be ordered via their web page (www.ncsa.com) for around $20, or downloaded
from Compuserve. </P>

<P>In the UK, the British Standards Institution have a Code of Practice
for Information Security Management which includes virus-management (BS7799).

<H2>Are there virus damage statistics?</H2>

<P>Some, possibly even less reliable than the average survey on general
security breaches. Why? </P>

<UL>
<LI>Many reported virus incidents aren't, in fact, virus incidents, as
many a PC support specialist will confirm. There is a tendency to attribute
any PC anomaly to a virus, among those who are not well acquainted with
the virus arena. Unfortunately, this includes virtually the entire press
corps and many security consultants. Also, some widely-used packages are
noticeably prone to false alarms.</LI>

<LI>Many actual virus incidents and other security breaches are not reported,
due to the intervention of top management or Public Relations, out of fear
of losing competitive advantage because of being perceived as badly-managed
and insecure.</LI>

<LI>Many other virus incidents and security breaches aren't reported because
they're simply not recognised as such, or at all.</LI>

<LI>There are no standards for reporting and assessing damage from viruses
and other security breaches. Take the case of Christopher Pile (the Black
Baron), who was convicted in the UK under the Computer Misuse Act: I have
seen estimates in the UK press of the damage sustained by the company most
affected by the viruses Pile spread ranging from #40,000 to #500,000, and
this is an unusually well-documented incident. How can the average survey
respondent be expected to make an accurate assessment? </LI>
</UL>

<P>The trouble is, there's a lot more to 'damage' than the figures estimated
for a particular outbreak. </P>

<H2>++ What is NCSA Approval?</H2>

<P>[NCSA has a certification program for PC virus scanners which offers
a measure of the detection capabilities of specific version numbers. In
the past, NCSA's modus operandi was the subject of much scepticism within
the antivirus community, but the current procedures are much improved.
The text that follows is a very lightly edited version of mail I received
from an analyst at NCSA, so it's not altogether impartial, but is nevertheless
a fair summary of their activities [but not quite accurate]. By the way,
NCSA has a somewhat similar program for firewalls, too (which is also somewhat
controversial). I'm leaving this in pending an opportunity to edit it more
thoroughly, but I must advise against giving NCSA certification quite as
much weight as some vendors would like. - DH] </P>

<P>For a list of scanners that have received the &quot;NCSA Approved&quot;
rating of the National Computer Security Association in the U.S.A. see
</P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.com/avpdcert.html">http://www.ncsa.com/avpdcert.html</A><BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>The page also explains the certification procedure. </P>

<P>The National Computer Security Association in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
U.S.A., sponsors an Anti-Virus Product Developers consortium. The NCSA
and consortium members have created standards for anti-virus products and
the NCSA Anti-virus lab in Carlisle tests new versions of scanners that
are submitted to it and issues an &quot;NCSA Approved&quot; seal for those
products which past the test. </P>

<P><B>++</B> <B>To pass, a scanner must detect all viruses (more than 400)
on the &quot;Wild List&quot;</B> kept by Joe Wells of IBM [Actually, this
isn't the case: detection of all viruses on <B>both</B> parts of the Wild
List isn't required for certification, as the information on NCSA's website
makes clear. In fact, it looks as if the implementation of NCSA certification
has somewhat slipped from its promising inception. I'll be returning to
this issue and other schemes (VSUM, Secure Computing) when time allows.
There are one or two other points in this item which I didn't check because
of their source: checking is now a priority. - DH] </P>

<P>and 90 percent of the viruses in a suite of about 11,000 kept by NCSA
(these represent not only viruses, but variations created by polymorphic
viruses as well.) </P>

<P><B>++</B> [The exact make-up of that test suite is one of the things
I'd like to check - DH] </P>

<P>NCSA also maintains an Anti-Virus Vendor's Forum on CompuServe (GO NCSA)
with message sections and libraries devoted to anti-virus products and
issues. </P>

<P>NCSA is a provider of security, reliability, and ethics information
and services. NCSA provides information security: training, testing, research,
product certification, underground reconnaissance, help-desk and consulting
services. NCSA delivers information through publications, conferences,
forums, and seminars -- in both traditional and electronic formats. NCSA
also hosts private on-line training and seminars on CompuServe in addition
to public forums and libraries and which address hundreds of information
and communications security issues. NCSA's InfoSecurity Resource Catalog
provides one-stop-shopping for books, guides, training and tools. </P>

<P><B>++</B> [I should observe here that I've received material from NCSA
in the past which advertises a book I would personally avoid recommending
on grounds of ethics <B>and</B> accuracy. As there was some fuss about
this, I don't suppose it's in their catalogue any longer, but this is another
point I'd quite like to check. - DH] </P>
