<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Part One: Understanding the Virus </FONT></B></P>

<P>This virus is known by several names: Concept. Prank Macro. WM-Concept.
WinWord.Concept. WordMacro.Concept. WW6. WW6Macro. Here we will use the
name Concept. </P>

<P>Concept is a macro virus. The virus is written is WordBASIC, which is
an interpreted programming language similar to Visual Basic for Applications.
WordBASIC is built into the Microsoft Word (MS-Word) environment. More
specifically, Concept is written in the English-language implementation
of this macro language. This being the case, Concept will run neither outside
of the MS-Word environment, nor within the MS-Word environment if WordBASIC
has been implemented in another language. </P>

<P>Even as DOS viruses run in the DOS environment, Concept runs in the
MS-Word environment. This makes Concept appear to be cross-platform. Since
it runs on systems that MS-Word runs on, then it runs on systems with Windows
3.x, Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh, etc. However, Concept is actually
neither a Windows nor a Macintosh virus. It is an MS-Word virus. MS-Word
is, virtually, the operating system that Concepts replicates within. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Infected Data Files? </FONT></B></P>

<P>Before Concept, the statement &quot;viruses do not infect data files&quot;
was generally accepted. Some say that Concept has now proven that axiom
wrong. Has it? Well, consider: The reason that this statement was widely
accepted hinges on the keyword infect. Infect is taken to mean that a functional
copy of the virus has been attached to a file. Data files are not executed,
so even if virus code is attached to data files it is not executed and
is therefore not functional. Data files with virus code attached are viewed
as corrupted, rather than infected. So what about Concept? </P>

<P>Well, applications with macro languages have confused the issue. Because
we now have files that can contain both data and executable code. However,
the data and executable portions of these files are separate and if Concept
wrote to the data portions of the file it would never be executed. Concept
must infect by adding its macros as executable code in the data file. So
technically, the data file, or at least the data portion of the file, is
not infected and the axiom is still defensible. </P>

<P>Three Macros </P>

<P>Concept contains three macros. Two are related to function and one is
simply a placeholder. Note however that the two functional macros are copied
with new names, one during each of two different infection phases, so that
a total of five macro names are associated with the virus. Here are the
macros names: </P>

<UL>
<P>* AutoOpen Functional Exists also as AAAZAO<BR>
* FileSaveAs Functional Exists also as AAAZFS<BR>
* PayLoad Place holder </P>
</UL>

<P>Notice that last two characters of each of the macros beginning with
AAAZ correspond to the functional versions: AO to Auto Open and FS to File
Save. </P>

<P>Concept infects in two distinct phases and thus exists in two distinct
forms. Here are the two forms: </P>

<PRE>   Infected Template                    Infected Document

   Contains macros:                     Contains macros:

      * AAAZAO                             * AAAZAO
      * AAAZFS                             * AAAZFS
      * FileSaveAs                         * AutoOpen
      * PayLoad                            * PayLoad

   Infected by document during          Infected by template during
   AutoOpen.                            FileSaveAs.
   Infects documents during FileSaveAs. Infects the default template during
                                        AutoOpen.
</PRE>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Phase One </FONT></B></P>

<P>During phase one, (the initial system infection) the default template
file (Normal.dot) is infected when a previously infected document file
is opened. </P>

<P>AutoOpen is one of five auto macros that are automatically run by MS-Word
environment. It is a template macro and runs whenever a template containing
it, or a document based on that template, is opened. </P>

<P>Concept's version of AutoOpen contains code to examine the environment,
infect the default template file, modify the profile, and display a message
box. This macro is copied once as AAAZAO and once as AutoOpen to a Word
document during the execution of a copy of the FileSaveAs macro. </P>

<P>This macro first checks the Word environment to see if it is already
infected or if infecting it would be too much trouble. To check for infection
it looks for a PayLoad macro. If no PayLoad is found, but a FileSaveAs
is found, then the virus considers infection to be too much trouble. In
either of these two cases, the macro aborts. </P>

<P>Next the macro attempts to retrieve a variable that appears to be an
attempt at a generation counter. However, due to a programming error, the
value will always be zero. (See details below.) </P>

<P>Next four macros are added to the default (global) template as shown
in the left box above. </P>

<P>Finally the generation counter (which is equal to zero) is incremented
and saved to the MS-Word ini file. At this point the generation counter
is also displayed in a message box. This box will always display the numeral
one, because of a programming error. The error is simply that the macro
retrieves profile variable named WW6Infector, but saves it under a different
name, WW6I. </P>

<P>The result is that WW6Infector is never initialized and is thus always
zero and that WW6I is always stored as one. </P>

<P>Under both Word for Windows and Word for Windows95 the generation variable
is stored in an initialization file is named WINWORD6.INI. This file will
contain the string &quot;WW6I= 1&quot; if a particular copy of Word has
ever been infected. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Phase Two </FONT></B></P>

<P>During phase two, (the virus's spread on a given system) document files
are infected as they are saved. The FileSaveAs function is called by MS-Word
both when saving an existing document with a new name (using Save As) and
when initially saving a new document (the Save As dialog box comes up for
a new document whether the Save As or Save command is used.). </P>

<P>The macro FileSaveAs exists in an infected template file and contains
code to infect MS-Word documents as they are saved. This macro is copied
once as AAAZFS and once as FileSaveAs to the default template during the
execution of the AutoOpen macro. </P>

<P>This macro adds its own functionality to the standard FileSaveAs dialog
box. In addition to calling the standard dialog, four macros are added
to the document as shown in the right box above. The effect is that the
documents become Concept droppers, since their infective function (AutoOpen)
will only run on an uninfected system. </P>

<P>To summarize the two phases: </P>

<UL>
<P>* Infected documents only infect default template files. Initial system
infection.<BR>
* Infected template files only infect documents. Spreading on a system.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">PayLoad </FONT></B></P>

<P>Like most viruses, Concept is not intentionally destructive. The macro
PayLoad is never executed. Even if it were, it contains no code, only a
comment. It says: &quot;That's enough to prove my point.&quot; </P>

<P>What was the programmer's point? We can only speculate. It may be that
macro viruses are possible. Or that MS-Word specific viruses are possible.
Or that OLE2 viruses are possible. Or that MS-Word has security holes.
If the programmer's point was one of these, he or she has indeed proven
it. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Detection and Removal </FONT></B></P>

<P>The only sure way to detect all instances of the virus is to use an
antivirus product. Be warned, however, that not all antivirus products
detect the virus, and some that do, don't do so by default. If you have
an antivirus product, be sure that Concept is in its list of viruses and
that the product is set to scan files with DOC and DOT extensions. Check
the software's documentation or call their technical support for this information.
</P>

<P>The only safe way to remove the virus from a system is to use an antivirus
product. Be warned again, that not all antivirus products are able to remove
the virus. Moreover, some that do repair the virus may not correctly repair
all documents. </P>

<P>Whether or not you have antivirus software, you should be aware of the
following information about Concept-specific symptoms to watch out for.
</P>

<P>The first indication that the system is infected is when the virus displays
its generation message box. </P>

<P>To verify that a system is infected, the user can view MS-Words list
of active macros. This is done by opening the Tools menu and selecting
the Macros option. The Macro dialog box will appear as is seen below. Note
that this is how the Macros dialog box will look right after the system
has just been infected, that is, right after the generation message box
has appeared. Later, right after an infected version of MS-Word is started,
the Macro dialog will not contain the AutoOpen macro. </P>

<P>Note that the macros can be highlighted and deleted from this dialog.
This will remove the macros from the default template file, but opening
any infected documents will re-infect the template. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Prevention </FONT></B></P>

<P>Three methods of preventing infection by Concept, from within the MS-Word
environment itself, have been proposed. Each is problematic. </P>

<P>First, some have recommended that you create your own macro named PayLoad.
This is because Concept checks for a macro by that name and, if one is
found, it does not infect. This idea has some problems. Some antivirus
software (especially Concept-specific, macro-based solutions) may think
that a system is infected if it sees the PayLoad macro name. In like manner,
a user might see the macro and panic. In addition, this method will prevent
only Concept, not other macro viruses. </P>

<P>You could use your own FileSaveAs macro to convince Concept that infection
is too much trouble. This would avoid antivirus false alarms and panicked
users, but would still only work with Concept. </P>

<P>The second suggestion has been to activate a Word feature that prompts
the user before saving changes to the global template. This is done by
opening the Tools menu, selecting Options, and clicking on the Save tab
in the Options dialog box. In the Save dialog box, check the box with the
caption &quot;Prompt to Save Normal Template.&quot; While this has no effect
on infected documents, it will prevent the global template from getting
infected, thereby preventing Concept from spreading. </P>

<P>The problem here is that the user must prevent the change to the template.
The message they will see gives no clue to the possibility of virus activity.
The message says &quot;Changes have been made that affect the global template,
Normal.dot. Do you want to save those changes?&quot; and offers the user
three choices: &quot;Yes&quot; (the default), &quot;No&quot;, and &quot;Cancel.&quot;
If the user is not aware that this prompt is there to stop viruses they
will probably make the wrong choice. Moreover, it the user is aware that
this may indicate a virus, and the changes to the template are valid, they
may still make the wrong choice and not save the needed changes. </P>

<P>The third suggestion involves using a macro to turn off auto macros
(others have suggested turning off all macros). This is done using MS-Word's
built-in macro called DisableAutoMacros. There are reportedly two methods
to do this. I tested both methods under Windows95 and Word for Windows95.
One method worked, one didn't. </P>

<P>Reportedly, one can add the switch /mDisableAutoMacros to the Winword.exe
command line. In my tests this didn't work. Concept still infected the
system. </P>

<P>Another way is to call the macro with a non-zero parameter. This I did
by adding my own AutoExec macro to run when MS-Word starts. My macro looked
like this: </P>

<UL>
<P>Sub Main </P>

<P>DisableAutoMacros 1 </P>

<P>End Sub </P>
</UL>

<P>This method worked. An infected document would open, but the AutoOpen
macro would not run and the global template would not become infected.
</P>

<P>A problem with this method (besides the command line switch not working)
is that there are five auto macros you disable with this function. Besides
AutoOpen and AutoExec, there are also AutoClose, AutoExit, and AutoNew.
This is fine unless you need some of these functions in your documents
or you receive a document that uses valid auto macros. </P>

<P>An additional problem with all three of these approaches is that they
do not detect the virus. The user is never told that the system is infected.
So Concept can still make the rounds finding systems it can infect. Detecting
and identifying the virus requires using an antivirus product. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Part Two: Understanding its Impact </FONT></B></P>

<P>Some virus experts are predicting that macro viruses will soon become
the most serious part of the virus problem. All available data seems to
indicate that Concept is the most common virus in the world. And it became
such in less than one year. </P>

<P>The first description of Concept that I saw was posted by Sarah Gordon,
of Command Software, to her fellow virus experts. This was on August 9,
1995. On the next day, the name &quot;Concept&quot; (in the form WinWord.Concept)
was suggested by C. Jimmy Kuo, of McAfee Associates. Since the virus was
not limited to Word for Windows, an alternate name, WordMacro.Concept,
was preferred by others. During a CARO (Computer Antivirus Research Organization)
meeting at the September 1995 Virus Bulletin Conference, the &quot;official&quot;
name was shortened to Concept. </P>

<P>The name Concept is quite fitting. True, macro viruses were not a new
concept and had been foretold and discussed within the antivirus community.
Still, dealing with Concept did indeed represent a new concept for antivirus
product developers. Even now, nearly one year later, some antivirus products
still fail to detect and/or repair the virus. </P>

<P>Handling Concept involved more than simply releasing a byte signature
or a new detection database. Most antivirus products have had to make major
code changes to their products. This is especially true of intelligent
scanners that trace or emulate execution. To apply such an approach to
analyzing MS-Word document files and to check therein for macros is quite
complex. Doing so properly requires an intimate knowledge of undocumented
OLE2. </P>

<P>OLE2 stream analysis is a far cry from simply tracing a jump or calculating
a code segment and instruction pointer. Even emulating an 8088 processor
seems easy by comparison. Add to this the fact that this is a highly competitive
field where customers expect short response times. Quick fixes and less
than optimum answers are inevitable. </P>

<P>Ten months after their first article on Concept, the magazine Virus
Bulletin pointed out this fact about macro viruses. </P>

<P>&quot;The format of the files they infect (Word documents) is many times
more complex than that of standard DOS executables.... For the moment we
have an intriguing mix of scanners, Word bolt-ons, macros of various sorts,
and combinations of these.&quot; Virus Bulletin May, 1996. </P>

<P>Even later, in their July 1996 issue, Virus Bulletin reported that eight
of twenty-four scanners they tested (using each scanner's default mode)
failed to detect Concept. This means that one third of these antivirus
products are missing the world's most common virus. </P>

<P>What also took the antivirus community by surprise was Concept's rapid
spread. This spread was accelerated partially by the fact that was unexpected,
but mostly by the fact that it was distributed on CD-ROM's (by Microsoft
and by Digital Equipment Corporation). </P>

<P>Reports that I receive to include in my WildList also shed light on
Concept's commonality. One participant's first report listed a few scattered
virus incidents, then added &quot;and Concept is everywhere!&quot; Other
participants often send lists that look much like this one from Blend Qatipi
in Tirana, Albania: </P>

<UL>
<P>AntiEXE More than 10 times </P>

<P>V-Sign 3 times </P>

<P>Boot.437 1 time </P>

<P>Concept Macro Virus Very frequent (first time Jan. 1996) </P>

<P>Concept has also topped Virus Bulletin's prevalence table from March,
1996 onward. </P>
</UL>

<P>Unfortunately, Concept's impact on major corporations has been neither
researched nor documented. Statements I've heard, however, do not bode
well. Things like: </P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;We have Concept all over the place and can't get rid of it.&quot;
A major software developer. </P>

<P>&quot;Concept was in all the Fortune 100 companies I visited in New
York.&quot; A virus expert. </P>

<P>&quot;They [a U.S. government department] have Concept everywhere.&quot;
An antivirus developer. </P>
</UL>

<P>Concept is a major, international problem. While it's true that Concept
is not destructive, the fact that it is so widespread represents a very
real threat. Because it is so common, its primary impact may be similar
to that of the Stoned virus. </P>

<P>Stoned is not destructive and it too was once the most common virus.
The result was that a large number of virus writers patterned their new
creations after Stoned. Some of these other viruses are intentionally destructive
and have become more common than Stoned. </P>

<P>In like manner, Concept may serve as a pattern for a whole new breed
of virus writers. Virus writers of the past were generally intelligent,
bored, students in their mid-teens with a knowledge of assembly language.
The next generation of virus writers may well be intelligent, disgruntled,
company contractors in their mid-twenties with a knowledge of Visual Basic
for Applications. </P>

<P>Yet consider this: Concept has been around for about one year at this
writing and we have not as yet seen any other macro virus become common.
Also, Concept did indeed get lucky by being shipped worldwide in CD's in
a world where both users and antivirus developers were unprepared. </P>

<P>So are Concept and other macro viruses foreshadows of a dark future?
We don't know. We don't have sufficient data to extrapolate. I'm afraid
we'll all have to wait and see. </P>
