<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I was 14 or 15 and my dad purchased a TI-99 4/A and I started teaching
myself BASIC. Programs were loaded with a cassette tape :) A buddy of mine
had one with a modem and we used to call all these bbs's long distance
on stolen calling card numbers. We would read sex stories, curse out people
on &quot;the war boards&quot; and download files on how to make bombs and
such. The time-frame here was like 1982? Maybe a bit later. I also ran
a small bbs for a time called &quot;The Electric Death BBS&quot; on a very
early Compaq Lugable (fucking thing must have been 30 pounds) ... it was
around the same time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmm, honestly I was bored, really high on prescription painkillers
(purchased not prescribed) and I decided to do some assembly programming
again. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes I write virii and I don't want to take any credit for the massively
hacked virii that I stuck a bunch of AOL'ers with. Beta's are a bitch!
Ummm I will take credit for anything that infected your system, even if
I didn't program it. If it annoyed you then I want credit for it :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They all end in .Poppy because I am a pill-head and all the good pills
come from the poppy plant! Why? Why not? They all get their first names
by accident. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I took COBOL in high school but I forgot most of it. I know Modula and
Pascal. I also do ok in Assembly and C++. I am working on my Visual C++
skills right now because I have a really good idea for my next virus ;)
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They all suck! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am part of <A HREF="groups2.htm#TNN">The Narkotic Network</A>. There
is just three of us. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I use AVP the most so I guess I like that the best. I have a copy of
every AV product on my hd so I can keep track of what programs can find
what virii and to cross check my work. I don't really hate any of them
- I don't have emotional attachments to any AV products.... I take that
back I LOVE the ones that still can find my virii! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To annoy countless users worldwide. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Don't really know much about it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>VicodinES is a the name for a painkiller here in the US. It's actually
Vicodin Extra Strength. I love those little fucking pills so I took that
name. It's just Hydrocodone and Tylanol. Anyway I was very high on the
little bastards when I decided to start writing virii so I thought it was
appropriate. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I played with <A HREF="creatrs2.htm#NRLG">NuKE NRLG</A> and <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#G2">PS
G2</A>. I thought they were pretty cool. I liked the basic idea behind
<A HREF="creatrs1.htm#DREG">DREG</A> - I never got a copy of the program
(basically never bothered to download it) but I liked they whole philosophy
behind it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Macro's are cool by me. I think sometimes it's way too easy to create
a new variant of a macro but I have seen some that really impressed me.
I won't ever write one but that's my preference. HLL virii are the way
to go. You can really kick some fucking ass with a C++ virii in 95 - just
wait, you will see. I have also heard that someone is working on Microsoft
Scripting virii? Kinda like batch virii in 95 .. but I haven't seen anything
yet. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Too early to tell for me. Though I do have confirmation of 300+ people
downloading an infected WinZip of mine. It was a carrier of Skim.Poppy
so I suspect that one will do me proud. Hey Joe Wells get used to typing
the word &quot;POPPY&quot; :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like <A HREF="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40 Hex</A> - I re-read them now and
again. The best new one is <A HREF="ezines1.htm#XINE">Xine</A>. <A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A</A>
is also cool. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know any. I only respect those that helped me with or without
knowing. People like Polt from the WCIVR and Cicatrix also AV'ers like
Eugene Kaspersky who answered my questions without bias. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>see above </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like UPS in warez!! Fuckin' BIG UP'S FELLAZ! I also thought Da Chronic
was amazing with AOHell. It's a simple thing now but unheard of when it
came out. AOHell was even in Newsweek. New ideas don't need to be complex
to gain my respect they just have to work. Da Chronic deserves much credit!
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Counter productive. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>All mine are good, I don't understand the question :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I run the MIS dept. for a large engineering firm (I only run one location
though) and I am industrial music artist on the side. You may one day own
one of my cd's. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not many - I don't invite people to judge my actions. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I dabble in warez. Fastin.Blee does more warez than I do. He keeps me
in the scene. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think in those terms. I am not governed by other peoples morals.
I wouldn't really take any heed in any laws. I would be forced to if it
directly affected me but until it does I won't waste time on debating those
issues with anyone or myself. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I would end up spouting off &quot;the one that was never caught&quot;
clich&eacute; here so I will pass. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Undiscovered country. Do yourself a favor and buy Andrew Schulman's
&quot;Unauthorized Windows 95 Developer's Resource Kit&quot; - I am a big
fan of GUI. I started in a text only world and I have no problems seeing
it go away. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am not a good one for advice. Too selfish and sarcastic to be taken
at face value, sorry. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="mailto:vcru@hotmail.com">vcru@hotmail.com </A></P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yea shouts out to Klonopin.Jones, Fastin.Blee, Flexoral.DeZego, DeadPete,
Mudcat &quot;Grave&quot; Rose, Monkey, Mousey and The Woobie! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any other comments? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes my Turn-On's are skinny little blonde chicks with straight hair,
very strong thuderstorms and getting free painkillers. Oh and one other
thing don't think you can invite me over to your house without me searching
your bathroom medicine cabinet for painkillers. I will steal them, you
can count on that. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Short responses to the following names or words:
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<PRE>- Dark Avenger       - created MtE right? If so then he rules!
- Dark Angel         - some virus guy who followed the rules and took 
                       a &quot;spooky&quot; name just like all the other sheep. 
                       What his accomplishments are I have no idea.
- Sarah Gordon       - Isn't she the queen of misinformation? I could be 
                       wrong here.
- Fridrik Skulason   - AV guy from Iceland 
                     - many fat chicks come from Iceland 
                     - I have seen Bj&ouml;rk's tits and she has nasty ones 
                     - ugggh don't go to Iceland
- Alan Solomon       - AV guy from DSAV - name makes me think he is fat.
- WordBasic/VBA      - cross-platform virii courtesy of Bill Gates
- VDAT               - I dig it
- VSUM               - loads of mistakes - bad source of information
- Assembler          - not a good language for 95 virii
- NuKE               - A group who I think are cool
- Phalcon Skism      - I really don't know the difference between any of 
                       the groups but I think these guys did a good job with G2
- VLAD               - I have borrowed some ideas from these ingenious fellows 
                     - I give you credit here and on my website.
- Trident            - some poly engine right?
- Polymorphic        - waste of time - just don't get detected in the first place
- Stealth            - waste of time in 95 - no one uses TBAV in the US 
                       anyway so I don't bother to think about stealth
- I hate......         &lt;list too long to print&gt;
- I love......         chocolate ice cream pops from Shop Rite and a 2 
                       liter of Diet Mountain Dew on an empty stomach
- IRC                - crap - who wants to chat while they are on a 
                       computer anyway - fucking waste of time
- Sex                - not as big of a driving force as in my life as it 
                       seems to be for others but I love to fuck when I get 
                       the chance</PRE>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and why did you get TNN started? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I told these two other guys (Klonopin.Jones + Fastin.Blee) who were
helping me distribute, debug and design virii that they were now in a group
and they didn't argue - so The Narkotic Network was born. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How is TNN organized? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Honestly there isn't much to be organized. I just kinda do what I want
with it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How are your other tutorials coming along?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have mixed feelings on tutorials. I don't deny the fact that I have
learned a TON from tutorials but I'm not so sure I am that comfortable
giving away all my ideas. I may not write any more tutorials. I have noticed
a few errors in <A HREF="tumisc30.htm">my first tutorial</A> anyway and
I can't deal with the constant proof reading I do in my head after I post
my ideas. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will you ever release a virus creator? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't have that much free time. I divide my free time between programming
and music. I have a computer dedicated to the internet and virii and one
dedicated to running my samplers, drum machines and syths. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is in your future and the future of TNN?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I want to turn the Narkotic Network web site into a a site where I ask
total strangers to send me all the drugs in their medicine cabinet. But,
I don't think I can get away with that. I really want to do that but I
don't want to risk it all and get caught! I guess we will just keep moving
forward with more complex virii and maybe more information. I will probably
even relocate when GeoShitties kills the site. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will TNN increase the number of members? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't really know. The Vx culture moves very slow and seems to communicate
very little (I have made attempts to cross pollinate with very little success)
so for right now three members is as good as it gets. I also tried to get
on #virii once to &quot;hang&quot; but I didn't have my IRC setup to +o
super-dork access so no chat for me. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Will TNN go into other scenes except VX? (hacking,
etc.) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We actually move a lot of warez. If you're into virii you gotta think
about distribution and if we stay up on whats hot then we can infect you
when you least expect it! </P>
</UL>
