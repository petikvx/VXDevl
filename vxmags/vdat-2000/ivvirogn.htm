<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>When I was 13, I got my first computer, a 286 8 mhz. When I got a 1200
bps modem, I fell in love with bbsing. After that, my computer became my
best friend. I was more interested in how things worked, then just making
them work. So, eventually I got into coding C and then moved into assembly.
I wrote several legitamate software progs, but for the most part virus
coding peaked my interest most. Virus coding is what really extended my
grasp on programming. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I believe it was the challenge involved, and the interest in the concept
of artificial life that first got me started coding virii. After I started
releasing better and better code, I eventually hooked up with my virus
colleagues. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It seems like with every virus I write, the ones preceeding it I'm not
quite as proud of &lt;g&gt;. However, my viruses include Offspring, Asexual,
Pinworm, One13th, Codejournal, Simplex, amungst others. LoRez is the latest
virus I've coded with my returning to scene. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Whatever comes to mind and isn't already taken.a </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ASM, C++ </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>ASM </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are/were you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I was a member of <A HREF="groups2.htm#NUKE">NuKE</A> before I left
the scene. Now, something new, [NOP] </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I haven't really checked out all the latest av software. I'm sure alot
has changed in the years I've been gone. However, thunderbyte was always
the av software I most respect. Mcafee is definatly the least. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To develop the next generation of win32 virii. Which I have made strides
to do with Yurn and its successor LoRez. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it benefits both sides. It keeps the game going. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Several years back when I first started coding, I briefly decided to
write a virus generator. This was probably beyond me at the time, because
I never finished. Regardless, I had named the generator Virogen and then
picked up as my handle. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They are interesting, but not practical. People would love to get around
the fact of having to code a virus, but there is no being lazy in the virus
world. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Macro viruses didn't exist when I was last in the scene. I dunno much
about them. I know that to have true infection power ur gonna have to do
some ASM coding. Fuck a bunch of macros. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think Pinworm was the most proliferated virus I wrote. It was definatly
in the wild. I think my first two Offspring and Asexual may have made it
a little ways. I haven't confirmed any others being in the wild. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="ezines1.htm#29A">29A's new zine</A> is the only recent zine
I've seen, and it's got some good code in it. I always loved <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
and <A HREF="ezines1.htm#IR">IR</A> releases too. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="ivqmisan.htm">Q</A>, priest, dark avenger </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>the thunderbyte dude </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>William Gibson </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it's viral suicide. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>hmm.. no. Anything that a virus could do for the good of the user, a
legitimate application could also do. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't have a real life. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, from my bbsing days most of the old-skool hackers in this town
know me. Other than that, I'm just sorta known to have a way with computers.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not lately. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think it should be illegal to disinfect a file. 1st degree murder.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (3.1/95/98) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not as difficult as I thought to code for. It intimidated me at first,
when I came back into the scene and saw the world went win-crazy. But alas,
viral coding in win32 isn't that bad. I am even beggining to like this
gui bullshit. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>knowledge=power. There's no shortcuts. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>try effnet #virus </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greets? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Why did you stop coding viruses some years
ago? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I moved out of my parents house the day I turned 18. From that day until
I was about 20, I partied my ass off. Ended up getting arrested for some
pretty serious dope shit, and now I'm back at mom's until I goto boot camp
for my crimes. </P>

that? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you planning on writing any tutorials?
