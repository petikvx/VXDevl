<P>The soon-to-be-published Microsoft Windows 95 introduces new characteristics
to the field of anti-virus activities. Although there have been rumors
that the virus threat will be eliminated when Windows 95 comes along, these
are, for the most part, insubstantial. In fact, almost all current viruses
will be able to function with Windows 95. </P>

<P>Boot sector viruses will be able to infect both hard disk Main Boot
Records and the boot sectors of disk partitions quite normally. However,
the viruses will not be able to spread to diskettes normally after the
initial infection. </P>

<P>When Windows 95 is started, it usually loads a 32-bit disk access system.
If, on the other hand, the computer has been infected by a boot sector
virus, Windows 95 is shunted to using 16-bit disk access system. In spite
of this, some parts of the 32-bit access systems are loaded, and this prevents
boot sector viruses from spreading to diskettes. This does not mean that
the viruses can be safely left on the disk, however, because they are still
able to activate and cause damage. The infection should be removed when
it is detected. It should be noted that if the user has set the 16-bit
disk access on from the Windows 95 Control Panel, the viruses will be able
to spread to diskettes quite normally. </P>

<P>Boot sector viruses that use DOS interrupts to infect diskettes will
not be able function under Windows 95 - the operating system's kernel takes
command over all DOS interrupts, thus preventing viruses from using them.
</P>

<P>Although Microsoft's own anti-virus program will not be supplied with
Windows 95, Windows 95 is capable of detecting a boot sector infection
by itself. Check the lower half of the Performance page in Control Panel's
System program - it may contain a warning about a MS-DOS -compatible disk
access state and a possible virus infection. Since this warning is not
repeated anywhere else, it is easy for a user to overlook. </P>

<P>File viruses, on the other hand, are able to function under Windows
95 almost as well as under DOS itself. The main difference is that the
viruses are only able to spread themselves inside DOS windows opened from
Windows 95. This holds true only for the present viruses, however - it
is likely that we will soon see viruses written expressly for Windows 95,
capable of exploiting its characteristics. Since Windows 95 is technically
quite different from earlier versions of Windows, only few currently known
Windows viruses will be able to function under it. </P>

<P><B>Disinfection of Viruses </B></P>

<P>During installation, Windows 95 asks whether the user wants to create
an utility diskette from which the computer can be booted afterwards. It
is recommendable to take the program up on its offer, for without such
an utility diskette it may prove difficult to disinfect certain boot sector
viruses - especially if no anti-virus program is immediately available
at the time. </P>

<P><B>Disinfection of Boot Sector Viruses </B></P>

<P>In principle, boot sector viruses are disinfected in Windows 95 in quite
the same way as in DOS. First, the computer must be booted from a clean
diskette - this can be done with either the Windows 95 utility diskette
created during installation, or a normal DOS boot diskette. After this,
the virus can be disinfected by using an anti-virus program. </P>

<P>If the computer is booted from the Windows 95 utility diskette, the
disinfection procedure may in some cases be interrupted by a warning about
direct disk access. This warning can usually be disabled by using Windows
95's own LOCK command, but it may sometimes prove necessary to boot the
computer from a DOS boot diskette. After a DOS boot, the infection can
be disinfected normally with F-PROT for DOS. As can be seen, it is worthwhile
to hang onto an old DOS boot diskette even after switching to Windows 95.
</P>

<P>If no anti-virus program is immediately available, it is possible to
attempt disinfection by using the operating system's own functions. This
can be done with the command FDISK/MBR, which can be used both after a
DOS- and a Windows 95 diskette boot. However, if the computer's hard disks
cannot be accessed normally after a diskette boot, one should not attempt
a FDISK/MBR disinfection. In such cases, the infecting virus has probably
encrypted the hard disk's partition table - there are viruses that do this,
among them the Stoned.Empire.Monkey viruses. </P>

<P>Viruses that have infected the boot sector of a disk partition can be
removed manually by using the Windows 95 utility diskette. After the diskette
boot, the infection can be removed by simply giving the SYS C: command
- this will cause the boot sector and system files to be rewritten on the
hard disk. If the computer has been booted from a DOS boot diskette, the
SYS C: command should not be used, because it will create a boot sector
different from the boot sectors used by Windows 95. </P>

<P><B>Disinfection of File Viruses </B></P>

<P>First, the computer should be booted from a clean diskette just to be
on the safe side. Windows 95 utility diskettes and DOS boot diskettes are
both suitable for booting. After that, the viruses are disinfected just
like in DOS. </P>
