<hr>
<p> <b>David L. Smith, who was arrested for creating and releasing the Melissa 
  virus in April, plead guilty on Thursday to a second-degree charge of computer 
  theft.</b></p>
<p>The Melissa macro computer virus hit companies on March 26 after being released 
  to a Usenet newsgroup as part of a list of porn sites contained in a Word document 
  infected with the virus. </p>
<p> The virus, which mailed itself out to the first 50 addresses listed in the 
  address book of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client, caused a massive spike in 
  e-mail traffic, flooding corporate e-mail servers. Companies such as Microsoft 
  Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: 
  LMT), and Lucent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LU) shut down their gateways to the 
  Internet in the face of the threat.</p>
<p> After Judge John Riccardi outlined the events, a nervous Smith read the following 
  statement:</p>
<p> "Yes, I admit those events occurred as a result of the spread of the Melissa 
  virus. But I did not expect or anticipate the amount of damage that took place. 
  When I posted the virus, I expected that any financial injury would be minor 
  and incidental. In fact, I included features designed to prevent substantial 
  damage. I had no idea there would be such profound consequences to others."</p>
<p> <span class="msubhead3"><b><font size="+1">'I certainly agree'</font></b></span></p>
<p>When the judge again asked if Smith agreed that it caused significant damage 
  to computer systems nationwide, Smith replied, "I certainly agree. It did result 
  in those consequences, without question." </p>
<p>The crime -- which covers intercepting computer communications and damages 
  to computer systems or data -- is punishable by 5 to 10 years in jail and up 
  to a $150,000 fine. As part of the plea agreement, Smith has agreed to the maximum 
  penalty for the crime, but the presiding judge could ignore the recommendation. 
</p>
<p> Smith appeared in Monmouth County, N.J., Superior Court at 10 a.m. ET. He 
  has another appearance scheduled in the U.S. District Court in Newark later 
  today to answer to federal charges in the case.</p>
<p> According to law enforcement sources close to the case, Smith will enter a 
  guilty plea in federal court as well. Edward Borden, Smith's attorney in the 
  case, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Court papers filed in August stated that Smith confessed to writing the virus. 
  Smith had admitted his guilt at the time of the arrest, said Paul Loriquet, 
  a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General's office, in a ZDTV interview. 
</p>
<p> "There was a statement made at the time of the arrest from Mr. Smith to our 
  investigator... that, in fact, at the time of the arrest, he had admitted to 
  creating the virus and had said that he had destroyed the personal computers 
  that he had used to post it on the Internet," Loriquet said in the report.</p>

<p><b>Law enforcement officials and computer security specialists say that David 
  L. Smith's conviction in the Melissa virus case -- the first successful prosecution 
  of a virus writer in the United States -- will have a strong chilling effect 
  on other authors of malicious code.</b></p>
<p> "We are hoping that the sentence has a significant deterrent impact," said 
  Robert J. Cleary, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, who led 
  the federal prosecution. "I think this will have the effect we want. Those predisposed 
  to white-collar crimes really do balance risk versus reward."
<p> Smith, 31, <a href="#GUILTY">pleaded guilty</a> in both state and federal 
  courts on Thursday, agreeing that the virus he wrote and released -- named "Melissa" 
  after a Florida stripper -- caused $80 million in damages (the minimum monetary 
  amount needed in order to trigger stiffer federal sentencing guidelines). 
<p>Smith is expected to receive anywhere between a four- and five-year sentence 
  in the federal case and up to a 10-year sentence in the state case, accompanied 
  by total fines of up to $400,000. As part of the plea agreement, state prosecutors 
  have recommended that the sentences run concurrently.</p>
<p> "The sentencing guidelines attempt to minimize disparity. If that works here, 
  then anyone else that sends a virus out that does $80 million in damage should 
  expect a similar sentence," said Cleary.
<p> <span class="msubhead3"><b><font size="+1">Melissa's March madness</font></b></span>
<p>The Melissa macro computer virus hit companies on Friday, March 26 after being 
  released to a Usenet newsgroup as part of a list of porn sites contained in 
  a Word document infected with the virus. 
<p>The virus, which mailed itself out to the first 50 addresses listed in the 
  address book of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client, caused a massive spike in

  and Lucent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LU) shut down their gateways to the Internet 
  in the face of the threat.</p>
<p> Smith -- then a resident of Aberdeen, N.J. -- was <a href="misc0028.htm">arrested</a> 
  on April 1 by New Jersey authorities. 
<p> "This becomes a landmark case, because it's the first time the (U.S.) federal 
  government has successfully prosecuted a computer virus writer," said Dr. Peter 
  Tippett, chief technologist at computer security firm ICSA.net, which helped 
  the U.S. prosecutors estimate the damages caused by Melissa.

<p> Tippett and others point to a virus case in England as potential proof that

<p>In November 1995, the <a href="lgguilt2.htm">UK courts sentenced Chris Pile 
  </a>-- known underground as the Black Baron -- to 18 months in jail. The 26-year-old,

  unauthorized access to computers to facilitate crime and five unauthorized modifications 
  of computer software over a two-year period. 
<p> Since that time, no major viruses have come out of the UK, said Tippett.
<p> Smith appeared in Monmouth County, N.J., Superior Court at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, 
  followed by his appearance at the U.S. District Court in Newark at 1:30 p.m.

<hr>
<p>Despite an <a href="#GUILTY">expected four- to five-year sentence</a> for admitted 
  Melissa virus writer David L. Smith, the number of new viruses appearing on 
  the Internet appears to be accelerating as the end of the millennium draws near, 
  anti-virus firms said Friday. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> &quot;We had an unprecedented deluge of viruses over the past two weeks and 
  we see no sign of it stopping,&quot; said Dan Schrader, vice president of new 
  technology for anti-virus firm Trend Micro Inc. </p>
<p>On Friday, Trend and computer support firm Computer Associates Inc. (NYSE: 
  CA) warned of a new virus that could potentially spread quickly among users 
  of the ICQ messaging service. The virus had hit one of Trend's largest corporate 
  customers, according to Schrader. </p>
<p><b>Just the latest, not the last</b></p>
<p> While the new virus, called TROJ_ICQGREETING by Trend, has a damaging payload, 
  an error in the program prevents it from activating. However, the virus's method 
  of spreading could potentially have a cascading effect similar to Melissa and 
  cause mass e-mailings, said a brief written by Trend. </p>
<p>TROJ_ICQGREETING is the latest in a host of network-aware viruses that have 
  hit the Internet in the past month. However, none of the viruses have spread 
  to the extent of Melissa. </p>
<p>Still, the fact that the new viruses use the Internet to multiply means that 
  more people are aware of them, said Sarah Ford, a well-known expert on virus 
  writers and the psychology of virus writing. </p>
<p>&quot;We have predicted an upswing in network-aware viruses, due to the growth 
  of the Internet and related technologies,&quot; she said. &quot;I suspect, if 
  it seems like there are 'more' viruses, it's probably closer to the truth to 
  say ... that the viruses that are out there have had wider effect -- this makes 
  it seem like a lot of 'activity.'&quot; </p>
<p><b>'Unconcerned' about Smith case</b></p>
<p> Ford also believes that the Smith case has had little effect on the virus 
  community. &quot;Most of the virus writers that I have spoken with recently 
  seem to be unconcerned about this particular case,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't 
  see this type of thing having any huge effect on virus creation per se, in the 
  short term.&quot; </p>
<p>Smith plead guilty in both state and federal courts on Thursday agreeing to 
  a maximum sentence in state court of 10 years in prison and up to $150,000 fine, 
  and a sentence in federal court of 5 to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 
  fine. Prosecutors recommended that the sentences run concurrently, though the 
  judge could decide not to adopt any or all of the recommendatons. </p>
<p> Smith was arrested by law enforcement officials on April 1, 1999, after <a href="misc0028.htm">a 
  six-day manhunt</a> for the writer of the Melissa virus. The Word macro virus, 
  which struck on Friday, March 26, affected hundreds of thousands of computers 
  when it flooded e-mail gateways. </p>
<p>While the resolution of the case may not have curtailed the virus community's 
  activities, the initial arrest did have some effect, said Richard Smith, an 
  independent security consultant (and no relation to the Melissa virus writer). 
</p>
<p>&quot;Right after (David L. Smith) was arrested, lots of folks retired as active 
  virus writers,&quot; he said. &quot;The stiff penalties are going to be pretty 
  scary for folks for awhile.&quot; </p>
