  Ruzz. Ruzz is one of a few UK virus programmers and founder of the underground 
  <a href="groups2.htm#SHADOW">Shadow Virus</a> group. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What are your opinions on virii with destructive payloads?</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do Shadow VX concern themselves with virus programming 
  only?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Have you been a member of any other groups?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Only UC ()and my group</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>When did you start learning to program and what was 
  your first programming language?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>VBS in march. no. not VBS, Javascript that was in the underground. i learn 
    VB when i was about 9. I never learnt ASM... never felt the need to</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What other languages can you program in?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>HTML, XML, VBS, JS, Javascript, XSL, CSS, WML, WSL, Basic (yep I can), Batch 
    etc etc</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of viruses written in languages 
  other that assembly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, i code in other languages other than ASM... VBS being the main one. 
    I think Internet aware codes are the thing of the future so I am here helping 
    to kick them off</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What groups do you value most highly?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My group. I hope it will go far. I also value <a href="groups1.htm#CB">CB</a>

    started to read the <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29a zines</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think of the virus scene? (Both in general 
  and in the UK.)</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, the virus scene is really necessary. With out us, the AV companies 
    whould have nothing to do and no one would realise how vulnerable systems 
    really are</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How has the underground scene changed since you first 
  entered?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most definately. If the scene did not change, nothing new would appear</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think the future of virus writing holds?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virus writing will go on for as long as there are computers and people to 
    depend on them. The future will consist of viral codes that are totally internet 
    aware and use AI to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Do you believe in a 'perfect virus'? And if so describe 
  it.</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Well, if I describe a perfect virus, someone will no doubt better it. So, 
    there will never be a "perfect" virus. Only "perfect" for the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What advice would you give to newbies entering the 
  virus scene?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don't always start on ASM... it aint the only language about. If u wanna 
    make a statement, learn something different and make something new</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Anything you would like to add?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Uhhh.... do I get paid for this? :P</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Any greets?</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone i have talked to via IRC, ICQ, Email and all that since starting 
    the scene</p>
