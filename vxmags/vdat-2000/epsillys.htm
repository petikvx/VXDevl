<P>Reading thru many posts on alt.comp.virus one wonders how much of an
education some people have. Some of the posts I copied below might not
be meant seriously but still you can not be sure. In future release I hope
to expand this section with more of the same, for now two examples: </P>

  I bought a computer about 3 weeks ago and scaned it with a well known
  program that kills viruses, and would you beleive it found one called
  Leprosey.

  Two days later i became very ill and the doctor diasgnosed me as having
  Scarlet Fever.  But it is very co-insedential that my computer comes down
  with a virus and two days later i am ill.

  Do you have to wear any protective equipment e.g gloves or a face mask
  when using a computer when infected with a virus.

  If anyone has any advice for me please do not hesitate to contact me..

  OK I'm new at this. Why are these viruses in zip form ?
  I see .asm, .com, and .diz files. Is the virus in the com file ?
  Will it work without the others ? How can I inconspicuously
  send one via e-mail ? Thanks
  Please e-mail:  xxxxxxxxx@xxxxxxx.xxx</PRE>
