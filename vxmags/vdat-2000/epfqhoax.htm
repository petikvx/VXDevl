<PRE>    There is a new virus going arround in the last couple of days!!! DO 
    NOT open or even look at any mail that you get thar says: &quot;Returned 
    or Unable to Deliver&quot; This virus will attach itself to your computer 
    components and render them useless. Immediately delete any mail 
    items that says this. AOL has said this is a very danderous virus, 
    and there is NO remedy for it at this time, Please Be Careful, And 
    forward to all your on-line friends A.S.A.P. </PRE>

<P>Naturally, you should: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Ignore the content of this message </LI>

<LI>Not delete any email with this subject (at least not because it might
contain a virus; feel free to delete any of your email that you WANT to
delete, of course!) </LI>

<LI><B>Definitely</B> not forward it to all and sundry </LI>

<LI>All of the above </LI>
</UL>

<P>Instead, you should reply to the sender -- and as far back up the email
chain as you have energy -- informing the originators that this is a hoax.
I suggest that you provide a pointer to this URL <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~wwwitd/virus-busters/hoaxes/unable.html">(http://www.umich.edu/~wwwitd/virus-busters/hoaxes/unable.html)

NaughtyRobot Hoax</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This hoax started in
mid January 1997. The NaughtyRobot is an e-mail that states &quot;Your
security has been breached by NaughtyRobot&quot;. First of all it is nonsense,
so if you get it &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, just have a good laugh and ignore
it. Your system has NOT been &quot;exploited&quot;, nor has your personal
information been &quot;captured&quot;.</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>What the NaughtyRobot
really is</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Basically it seems to
be a &quot;robot&quot; that sends you its e-mail message at random. (See
the <A HREF="#text">text</A> of the message below.) When I say robot here,
I mean a program that searches the Web automatically, jumping from website
to website through the pages' links. There are many robots (AKA &quot;bots&quot;,
AKA &quot;spiders&quot;) wandering around the Internet and most of them
are well behaved and useful things. This is just a case of a robot &quot;gone
bad&quot; (actually robots are not really bad, they are just programmed
that way...) In this case the program seems to look at the HTML source
for the &quot;mailto&quot; tag. It then sends its e-mail message to the
tag's e-mail address and pastes whatever text link is used into the &quot;From&quot;
field.</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>For example if your page
has the HTML tag</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>   &lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:yourname@youraddress.com&quot;&gt; yourname@youraddress.com&lt;/A&gt;</FONT></FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>then the &quot;From&quot;
field will be</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;yourname@youraddress.com&quot;</FONT></FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><BR>
<TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>However if your page has
the HTML tag</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<PRE><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>   &lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:yourname@youraddress.com&quot;&gt; Your Real Name&lt;/A&gt;</FONT></FONT></TT></PRE>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>then the &quot;From&quot;
field will be &quot;Your Real Name&quot;.</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It seems unusual enough
to receive e-mail with your own e-mail address appearing in the &quot;From&quot;
field, (as if you mailed it to yourself), but for those who have had their
&quot;Real Name&quot; used, it seems even odder. This automatic &quot;personal
touch&quot; is what makes the NaughtyRobot so naughty. So who is doing
this? Or more to the point...</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>How can I find out who
REALLY sent this (or any other) e-mail to me?</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>You can see how easy
it is to fake e-mail, (for more info on e-mail fraud <A HREF="http://www.cnet.com/Content/Features/Dlife/Crime/ss01b.html">Read
This</A>). But you can trace e-mail to see who really sent it this way.</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

the postmaster@frdbib.bibsyst.no of this abuse of their system, and Ola
is dealing with it. )</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The postmaster is a good
person and DID NOT write you the NaughtyRobot, they just passed it along
to you - so be nice to them :-). The postmaster is like your local snail
mail post office worker. You can't blame your mailperson for delivering
the junk mail!</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When you e-mail the postmaster,
send the &quot;Message-Id&quot; and the time you receive the e-mail, it
may be possible to check which user on his system had sent the message.
The postmaster will probably e-mail you that information if asked, or they
might just deal with the &quot;naughty&quot; e-mailers themselves. It is
also possible that the postmaster has not kept the records of who sent
it (these sorts of records can tend to become very large). Either way you
have alerted the postmaster to the fact that somebody is abusing their
system by sending this stuff.</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In the case of the Naughtyrobot:</FONT></FONT></TT></P>

<P>There is the possibility that the sender's address the postmaster has,
is also a fake one. From feedback I have recieved, it might also be possible
that the postmaster's address appearing in your header was a fake one,
and that their system never even actually has a log of passing the message
to you!</P>

<PRE>Subject: security breached by NaughtyRobot
From: yourname@youraddress

This message was sent to you by NaughtyRobot, an Internet spider
that crawls into your server through a tiny hole in the World Wide Web.


NaughtyRobot exploits a security bug in HTTP and has visited your

 host system to collect personal, private, and sensitive information.


It has captured your Email and physical addresses, as well as your
 phone and credit card numbers.  To protect yourself against the
 misuse of this information, do the following:


        1. alert your server SysOp,
        2. contact your local police,
        3. disconnect your telephone, and
        4. report your credit cards as lost.

Act at once.  Remember: only YOU can prevent DATA fires.

This has been a public service announcement from the makers of
NaughtyRobot -- CarJacking its way onto the Information SuperHighway.</PRE>

<P>Yukon3u.mp is not a virus. It is a hoax. The &quot;virus&quot; does
not exist. There is currently no virus that has the characteristics ascribed
to Yukon3u.mp. The text of the hoax appears below:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier">YUKON3U.mp VIRUS IS ABOUT TO STRIKE THE NEWSGROUPS!<BR>
As many of you know, the amount of viruses that have been posted within
the past couple of months are tremendous -- now we have 2 new threats to
contend with.<BR>
To continue... a medium amount of the rec ent posts in some of the Alt.Binaries
have contained a time-bomb trojan virus called YUKON3U.mp which is a derivative
of a 2nd generation Mutating Engine developed by the Dark Avenger -- a
self-described &quot;King&quot; of viruses from Bulgaria. The only differenc
e is that this strain has a stealth capability beyond the reach of Norton
or McAfee Anti-Virus programs latest updates, with the possible, but not
probable exception of Dr. Soloman's Anti-Virus version 7.69. The encryption
technique is incredible. The YUK ON3U.mp virus is somehow compiled within
the UUE code of the JPG itself, and when decoded will install the virus
onto the boot sector of the hard drive, and lie in wait for the trigger
date sometime in April (changing your internal system clock won't help
since the trigger day changes with each infection). The only constant is
the month itself. The simple fact of decoding the file via a newsreader
or third-party decoder such as Wincode automatically runs and installs
the virus without detection, thereby e liminating the wait for somebody
actually launching the file by accident (we all know viruses do nothing
unless they're launched). For all intents and purposes, the JPG is viewable
without any problems and normal in every way, but there is a second file
hiding within your boot sector without detection. One of the effects carries
a nasty manipulation task which damages hardware -- an interrupt call set
to a track value beyond 39, which will cause the drive heads to move past
the inner track of the hard drive, causing the heads to stick on some models.
That isn't the worst of it. Untitled posts which contain special BOTS that
are basically invisible and cannot be seen or read by newsgroup readers
have also been recently posted according to Dr. Soloman's web-site. These
BOTS are capable of replacing ASCII characters within all posts in the
Alt. Binaries newsgroups (i,e. H becomes S, G becomes F, and so on). The
BOTS are triggered to alter other user posts by certain words contained
in the post, or by calling upon the Cancel Date of the article ( probably
some time in April ).It's very possible that the same group who posted
the KILL-BOTS last July are behind this second posting along with the YUKON3U.mp
virii.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>While being slightly more elaborate and claiming that information regarding
Yukon has already been put onto the Dr. Solomon's Web site to lend credibility,
this is still a hoax claim. Viewing a JPEG file cannot result in viral
infection in the same way that you won' t get a biological virus by looking
at a photograph of somebody who's infected. Despite intense discussion,
nobody has been able to provide proof of a virus damaging hardware. Please
ignore any messages regarding this supposed &quot;virus&quot; and do not
pass on any messages regarding it. Passing on messages about this hoax
serves only to further propagate it.</P>

<P>Recently there has been a lot of confusion regarding &quot;AOL4FREE&quot;.
The confusion has been generated by three separate events: </P>

<LI><B>The AOL4FREE Macintosh Program.</B></LI>

<LI><B>The distribution of an AOL4FREE hoax message (virus), which was
spread via email and usenet newsgroups. </B></LI>

which was spread a few weeks later.</B></LI>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The AOL4FREE Macintosh Program</FONT></B></P>

<P>This was originally written to provide illegal free access to America
Online. In the March 1997 issue of the <I>CSI Computer Security Alert</I>
the following statement was made concerning the creator of that program:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;A former Yale computer science student has pleaded guilty to defrauding
America Online. AOL estimates it lost between $40,000 and $70,000 in service
charges because the student distributed his computer program, AOL4FREE,
to hundreds of other users.&quot; </P>

<P><B>Note that any attempt to use the original AOL4FREE.COM program may
subject you to prosecution.</B></P>

<P>AOL4Free is not a virus. It is a hoax. The &quot;virus&quot; does not
exist. There is currently no virus that has the characteristics ascribed
to AOL4Free. The e-mail &quot;warning&quot; has been widely distributed
on the largest online service provider, America Online (AOL), beginning
sometime in March 1997. Please ignore any messages regarding this supposed

   VIRUS ALERT!!!
     DON'T OPEN E-MAIL NOTING &quot;AOL4FREE&quot;

   Anyone who receives this must send it to as many people as you can.  It
   is essential that this problem be reconciled as soon as possible.  A few
   hours ago, I opened an E-mail that had the subject heading of &quot;AOL4FREE.COM&quot;.
   Within seconds of opening it, a window appeared and began to display my files
   that were being deleted.  I immediately shut down my computer, but it was too 
   late.  This virus wiped me out.  It ate the Anti-Virus Software that comes with
   the Windows '95 Program along with F-Prot AVS.  Neither was able to detect it.
   Please be careful and send this to as many people as possible, so maybe this
   new virus can be eliminated.

<P>Good Times is not a virus; it is a complete hoax. There is currently
no virus that has the characteristics ascribed to Good Times. The e-mail
Good Times &quot;warning&quot; was written by a couple of pranksters on
America Online (AOL) sometime in 1994. Since then, it has traveled the
Internet electronic mail system, spreading fear wherever it crops up. The
message is just convincing enough that people spread the news to all of
their friends. Needless to say, it has propagated itself well over the
years. Please ignore any messages regarding this supposed &quot;virus&quot;
and do not pass on any messages regarding it. Passing on messages about
this hoax on serves only to further propagate it. </P>

<P><B><I>The original &quot;Good Times&quot; hoax was posted and circulated
in November and December of 1994 follows:</I></B></P>

<PRE>     Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.
     Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on 
     America Online being sent by E-Mail. If you get anything called &quot;Good Times&quot;, 
     DON'T read it or download it. It is a virus that will erase your hard drive. 
     Forward this to all your friends. It may help them a lot.</PRE>

<P>Soon after the release of CIAC NOTES 04, another &quot;Good Times&quot;
message was circulated. This is the same message that is being circulated
during this recent &quot;Good Times&quot; rebirth. This message includes
a claim that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a warning
about the danger of the &quot;Good Times&quot; virus, but the FCC did not
and will not ever issue a virus warning. </P>

<P><B><I>The following is the expanded &quot;Good Times&quot; hoax message:</I></B></P>

<PRE>     The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of
     major importance to any regular user of the InterNet.  Apparently,
     a new computer virus has been engineered by a user of America
     Online that is unparalleled in its destructive capability.  Other,
     more well-known viruses such as Stoned, Airwolf, and Michaelangelo
     pale in comparison to the prospects of this newest creation by a
     warped mentality. 

     What makes this virus so terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that
     no program needs to be exchanged for a new computer to be infected.
     It can be spread through the existing e-mail systems of the
     InterNet. Once a computer is infected, one of several things can
     happen.  If the computer contains a hard drive, that will most
     likely be destroyed. If the program is not stopped, the computer's
     processor will be placed in an nth-complexity infinite binary loop
     - which can severely damage the processor if left running that way
     too long.  Unfortunately, most novice computer users will not
     realize what is happening until it is far  too late.</PRE>

<P>The following spoof of the good times hoax is too well done not to include
here. It is only included for a little light relief.</P>

<PRE>READ THIS:

             Goodtimes will re-write your hard drive. Not only that, but
     it will scramble any disks that are even close to your computer. It
     will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting so all your ice
     cream goes melty. It will demagnetize the strips on all your credit
     cards, screw up the tracking on your television and use subspace field
     harmonics to scratch any CD's you try to play.

             It will give your ex-girlfriend your new phone number. It
     will mix Kool-aid into your fishtank. It will drink all your beer and
     leave its socks out on the coffee table when there's company coming
     over. It will put a dead kitten in the back pocket of your good suit
     pants and hide your car keys when you are late for work.
 
             Goodtimes will make you fall in love with a penguin. It will
     give you nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour sugar in your
     gas tank and shave off both your eyebrows while dating your
     girlfriend behind your back and billing the dinner and hotel room to
     your Discover card.

              It will seduce your grandmother. It does not matter if she
     is dead, such is the power of Goodtimes, it reaches out beyond the
     grave to sully those things we hold most dear.
     
             It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't
     find it. It will kick your dog. It will leave libidinous messages on
     your boss's voice mail in your voice! It is insidious and subtle. It
     is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is also a rather
     interesting shade of mauve.

             Goodtimes will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the
     toilet seat up. It will make a batch of Methanphedime in your bathtub
     and then leave bacon cooking on the stove while it goes out to chase
     gradeschoolers with your new snowblower.

             Listen to me. Goodtimes does not exist.

             It cannot do anything to you. But I can. I am sending this
     message to everyone in the world. Tell your friends, tell your
     family. If anyone else sends me another E-mail about this fake
     Goodtimes Virus, I will turn hating them into a religion. I will do
     things to them that would make a horsehead in your bed look like
     Easter Sunday brunch.</PRE>

             FCC WARNING!!!!! -----DEEYENDA PLAGUES INTERNET

    The Internet community has again been plagued by  another computer 
    virus.  This message is being spread throughout the Internet, including 
    USENET posting, EMAIL, and other Internet activities.  The reason for 
    all the attention is because of the nature of this virus and the 
    potential security risk it makes.  Instead of a destructive Trojan 
    virus (like most viruses!), this virus referred to as Deeyenda Maddick, 
    performs a comprehensive search on your computer, looking for valuable 
    information, such as email and login passwords, credit cards, personal 
    inf., etc.

    The Deeyenda virus also has the capability to stay memory resident 
    while running a host of applications and operation systems, such as 
    Windows 3.11 and Windows 95.  What this means to Internet users is that 
    when a login and password are send to the server, this virus can copy 
    this information and SEND IT OUT TO UN UNKNOWN ADDRESS (varies).
         
    The reason for this warning is because the Deeyenda virus is virtually 
    undetectable.  Once attacked your computer will be unsecure.  Although 
    it can attack any O/S this virus is most likely to attack those users 
    viewing Java enhanced Web Pages (Netscape 2.0+ and Microsoft Internet 
    Explorer 3.0+ which are running under Windows 95).  Researchers at 
    Princeton University have found this virus on a number of World Wide 
    Web pagesand fear its spread.

    Please pass this on, for we must alert the general public at the 
    security risks.</PRE>

<P><A NAME="pkzip"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+3>PKZip Trojan, PKZ300B.ZIP</FONT></B></P>

<P>Although this trojan horse at one time existed, there has been no reported
infection or destruction caused by it since late 1995. The rumor of its
existence, however, has been quickly spreading through Internet mail from
the time it was first discovered. This trojan horse program, although it
did exist at one time, is now more a rumor or hoax than an actual threat
to the public. It has caused more damage and concern through its rumored
existence than by direct action of the program itself. For those interested,
here is a summary of how the original strain functioned. Again, it is not
currently considered in distribution and is not considered a threat to
the public. 3b Trojan is a Trojan Horse program that claims to be the latest
version of PKZIP, Version 3.0g, from PKWARE Inc. 3b Trojan was first received
by the Symantec AntiVirus Research Center in late July 1995. The definition
(fingerprint) was integrated into the August 1995 virus definition set
and has been part of every update since that initial release. 3b Trojan
is not a virus. Trojan Horse programs do not replicate and spread themselves.
Instead, they masquerade as legitimate programs, in this case, as a new
release of PKZIP. Users download these programs, thinking them beneficial,
and run them. For the event, or trigger, to take place, users must manually
download these files and consciously run them. The vast majority of Trojan
Horse programs are written with a destructive intention. 3b Trojan has
been distributed under the following names: (a) PKZ300B.EXE (b) PKZ300B.ZIP
(c) PKZIP300.EXE (d) PKZIP300.ZIP The triggered event is to format the
hard drive. The &quot;self-extracting&quot; versions of the executable
(.EXE) files for 3b Trojan (.EXE) and the &quot;PKZIP&quot; program within
it have this trigger. There have also been reports that 3b Trojan &quot;affects
modems of 1.44 and higher.&quot; These accounts are incorrect: 3b Trojan
has no such capability.As of November 1996, only the following releases
of DOS PKZIP program are valid: (a) 1.10 (b) 1.93 (c) 2.04c (d) 2.04e (e)
2.04g In response to 3b Trojan, PKWARE Inc. has issued the following statement:</P>

<PRE>     !!! PKZIP Trojan Horse Version - (Originally Posted May 1995) !!!</PRE>

<PRE>     It has come to the attention of PKWARE that a fake version of PKZIP is being 
     distributed as PKZ300B.ZIP or PKZ300.ZIP. It is not an offical version from 
     PKWARE and it will attempt to erase your hard drive if run. It attempts to 
     perform a deletion of all the directories of your current drive. If you have 
     any information as to the creators of this trojan horse, PKWARE would be 
     extremely interested to hear from you. If you have any other questions about 
     this fake version, please e-mail support@pkware.com</PRE>

<P>Since 1988, computer virus hoaxes have been circulating the Internet.
In October of that year, according to Ferbrache (&quot;A pathology of Computer
Viruses&quot; Springer, London, 1992) one of the first virus hoaxes was
the 2400 baud modem virus:</P>

<PRE>        SUBJ: Really Nasty Virus
        AREA: GENERAL (1)
        
        I've just discovered probably the world's worst computer virus 
        yet. I had just finished a late night session of BBS'ing and file 
        treading when I exited Telix 3 and attempted to run pkxarc to 
        unarc the software I had downloaded. Next thing I knew my hard 
        disk was seeking all over and it was apparently writing random 
        sectors. Thank god for strong coffee and a recent backup. 
        Everything was back to normal, so I called the BBS again and 
        downloaded a file. When I went to use ddir to list the directory, 
        my hard disk was getting trashed again. I tried Procomm Plus TD 
        and also PC Talk 3. Same results every time. Something was up so I 
        hooked up to my test equipment and different modems (I do research 
        and development for a local computer telecommunications company 
        and have an in-house lab at my disposal). After another hour of 
        corrupted hard drives I found what I think is the world's worst 
        computer virus yet. The virus distributes itself on the modem sub-
        carrier present in all 2400 baud and up modems. The sub-carrier is 
        used for ROM and register debugging purposes only, and otherwise 
        serves no othr (sp) purpose. The virus sets a bit pattern in one 
        of the internal modem registers, but it seemed to screw up the 
        other registers on my USR. A modem that has been &quot;infected&quot; with 
        this virus will then transmit the virus to other modems that use a 
        subcarrier (I suppose those who use 300 and 1200 baud modems 
        should be immune). The virus then attaches itself to all binary 
        incoming data and infects the host computer's hard disk. The only 
        way to get rid of this virus is to completely reset all the modem 
        registers by hand, but I haven't found a way to vaccinate a modem 
        against the virus, but there is the possibility of building a 
        subcarrier filter. I am calling on a 1200 baud modem to enter this 
        message, and have advised the sysops of the two other boards 
        (names withheld). I don't know how this virus originated, but I'm 
        sure it is the work of someone in the computer telecommunications 
        field such as myself. Probably the best thing to do now is to 
        stick to 1200 baud until we figure this thing out.

<P>This bogus virus description spawned a humorous alert by Robert Morris
III :</P>

<PRE>        Date: 11-31-88 (24:60)  Number: 32769
        To: ALL Refer#: NONE
        From: ROBERT MORRIS III Read: (N/A)
        Subj: VIRUS ALERT       Status: PUBLIC MESSAGE
        
        Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than 
        anything I've seen before! It gets in through the power line, 
        riding on the powerline 60 Hz subcarrier. It works by changing the 
        serial port pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks 
        spin. Over 300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy, 
        West Dakota alone! And that's just in the last 12 minutes.
        
        It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple-II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac, 
        RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.
        
        To prevent the spresd of the worm:
        
        1) Don't use the powerline.
        2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this 
          virus has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the 
          positive poles of the batteries. (You might try hooking up just 
          the negative pole.)
        3) Don't upload or download files.
        4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.
        5) Don't read messages. Not even this one!
        6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.
        7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.
        8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or 
          mainframes.
        9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or 
          airconditioning, running water, writing, fire, clothing or the 
          wheel.
        
        I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this 
        virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic flui9ds of 
        our computers can be kept pure.

<P>Since that time virus hoaxes have flooded the Internet.With thousands
of viruses worldwide, virus paranoia in the community has risen to an extremely
high level. It is this paranoia that fuels virus hoaxes. A good example
of this behavior is the &quot;Good Times&quot; virus hoax which started
in 1994 and is still circulating the Internet today. Instead of spreading
from one computer to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to
pass it along.</P>

<P><A NAME="howto"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+3>How to Identify a Hoax</FONT></B></P>

<P>There are several methods to identify virus hoaxes, but first consider
what makes a successful hoax on the Internet. There are two known factors
that make a successful virus hoax, they are: (1) technical sounding language,
and (2) credibility by association. If the warning uses the proper technical
jargon, most individuals, including technologically savy individuals, tend
to believe the warning is real. For example, the Good Times hoax says that
&quot;...if the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be
placed in an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severely damage
the processor...&quot;. The first time you read this, it sounds like it
might be something real. With a little research, you find that there is
no such thing as an nth-complexity infinite binary loop and that processors
are designed to run loops for weeks at a time without damage.</P>

<P>When we say credibility by association we are referring to whom sent
the warning. If the janitor at a large technological organization sends
a warning to someone outside of that organization, people on the outside
tend to believe the warning because the company should know about those
things. Even though the person sending the warning may not have a clue
what he is talking about, the prestige of the company backs the warning,
making it appear real. If a manager at the company sends the warning, the
message is doubly backed by the company's and the manager's reputations.</P>

<P>Individuals should also be especially alert if the warning urges you
to pass it on to your friends. This should raise a red flag that the warning
may be a hoax. Another flag to watch for is when the warning indicates
that it is a Federal Communication Commission (FCC) warning. According
to the FCC, they have not and never will disseminate warnings on viruses.
It is not part of their job.</P>

<P>CIAC recommends that you DO NOT circulate virus warnings without first
checking with an authoritative source. Authoritative sources are your computer
system security administrator or a computer incident advisory team. Real
warnings about viruses and other network problems are issued by different
response teams (CIAC, CERT, ASSIST, NASIRC, etc.) and are digitally signed
by the sending team using PGP. If you download a warning from a teams web
site or validate the PGP signature, you can usually be assured that the
warning is real. Warnings without the name of the person sending the original
notice, or warnings with names, addresses and phone numbers that do not
actually exist are probably hoaxes.</P>

<P>
<HR><p></P>

<P><A NAME="whatto"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+3>What to Do When You Receive a
Warning </FONT></B></P>

<P>Upon receiving a warning, you should examine its PGP signature to see
that it is from a real response team or antivirus organization. To do so,
you will need a copy of the PGP software and the public signature of the
team that sent the message. The CIAC signature is available from the CIAC
web server at: <A HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov">http://ciac.llnl.gov/</A>
If there is no PGP signature, see if the warning includes the name of the
person submitting the original warning. Contact that person to see if he/she
really wrote the warning and if he/she really touched the virus. If he/she
is passing on a rumor or if the address of the person does not exist or
if there is any questions about theauthenticity or the warning, do not
circulate it to others. Instead, send the warning to your computer security
manager or incident response team and let them validate it. When in doubt,
do not send it out to the world. Your computer security managers and the
incident response teams teams have experts who try to stay current on viruses
and their warnings. In addition, most anti-virus companies have a web page
containing information about most known viruses and hoaxes. You can also
call or check the web site of the company that produces the product that
is supposed to contain the virus. Checking the PKWARE site for the current
releases of PKZip would stop the circulation of the warning about PKZ300
since there is no released version 3 of PKZip. Another useful web site
is the &quot;Computer Virus Myths home page&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.kumite.com/myths/">http://www.kumite.com/myths/</A>)
which contains descriptions of several known hoaxes. In most cases, common
sense would eliminate Internet hoaxes.</P>
