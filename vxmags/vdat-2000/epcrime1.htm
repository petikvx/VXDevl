<p align="left"><font size="3">The computer virus may just be the
modern plague that afflicts the upcoming millennium. The
&quot;infection&quot; numbers are staggering. The annual damage
cost associated with viruses was estimated at over $1 billion for
last year and is expected to rise to $2 to $3 billion in the
upcoming year. One survey found that 98 percent of North American
businesses have been infected by the over 6,000 types of viruses
that are currently cataloged. One virus, Concept, is believed to
have infected nearly one half of all companies nationwide within
one year.</font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p><font size="3">While once seen as pranks or the products of
misdirected creativity, viruses now comprise business pathogens
with destructive powers. In light of the tremendous and growing
costs of computer crime, which spiral upward as more businesses
link to the Internet thus accelerating the rate at which
contagion can spread, the FBI's Computer Crime Squad in late
January mounted a nationwide series of raids targeting the
seizure of evidence of various computer crimes, <i>including</i>
the spreading of viruses. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The eight city search culminated
an eight month investigation dubbed Operation <i>Cyber Strike</i>.
While the FBI has decided to hold off arresting any suspects
until after it analyzes the confiscated materials, the strike
itself invites us to ponder the potential fate of these
&quot;masterminds&quot; who create destructive computer viruses.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Today, in the U.S., the most likely avenue of
prosecution is the Federal Computer Abuse Act of 1994 (18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1030). Amending the earlier 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act, the new Act is much clearer and more encompassing than the
older act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Seeking to avoid hypertechnical arguments about
what is and is not a &quot;virus&quot; -- or a &quot;worm&quot;
or a &quot;Trojan horse,&quot; etc. and whether they differ from
&quot;viruses&quot; -- the new Act outlaws the &quot;transmission
of a program, information, code, or command&quot; that
&quot;cause[s] damage to a computer, computer system, network,
information, data or program.&quot; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(5)(A).
As intended, this language should encompass both existing viruses
and any future virus-like creations. The earlier law, which
focused on the unauthorized access to a computer system, proved
to be ineffectual at times because it focused merely on the
crossing of a system-level boundary and also became outdated as
technology advanced. The new law is an improvement because it's
directed against the act of transmitting the virus. Prosecutors
are no longer strained to argue that the viral release
constitutes an unauthorized entry, instead the deliberate
transmission of a viral release is a crime unto itself.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The 1994 Computer Abuse Act tries to deal
differently with those who foolhaeartedly launch viral attacks
and those who do so intending to wreak havoc. To do this, the the
Act defines two levels of prosecution for those who create
viruses. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">For those who intentionally cause damage by
transmitting a virus, the punishment can amount to ten years in
federal prison, plus a fine.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For those who transmit a virus with only
&quot;reckless disregard&quot; to the damage it will cause, the
maximum punishment stops at a fine and a year in prison.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By differentiating along the lines of the
intent to damage, the new law efficiently accounts for the two
typical &quot;strains&quot; of viral creators. The first
&quot;strain&quot;, which is becoming increasingly more common,
is the intelligent, disgruntled employee or contractor or
sociopath who intentionally infects someone's computer system so
as to destroy data and files. Recent cases of this type have
appeared in New York, Texas, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Under the
new federal law, these individuals would be classified at the
&quot;intentional&quot; level and thus could face up to ten years
in prison.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second classification deals with what we
more would commonly perceive as the stereotypical viral creator
-- typically, a young computer wiz who is both curious and eager
to show off his or her expertise by pointing out the flaws in the
&quot;system&quot; or in the computer safeguards erected by
others. The case of the 1988 &quot;Internet Worm,&quot; that
Robert Morris, Jr. incubated and released, typifies this kind of
criminal defendant. According to Morris, he launched his
&quot;worm&quot; to point out the security flaws of other
computer networks. However, his worm program replicated much
faster than Morris expected and caused over a billion dollars in
damage by overloading systems and causing them to crash or slow
to the point that they became non-functional. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The U.S. Justice Department prosecuted Morris
under the 1986 Act, an awkwardly worded piece of legislation
arguably unclear as to the necessity that the prosecutors prove
Morris had the specific intent to cause damage. Morris argued
that the damage he caused was unintentional and, thus, his action
not illegal under the old act. The case went to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld Morris'
conviction and held that there was no intent-to-cause-damages
requirement. <i>United States v. Morris</i>, 928 F.2d 504, 509
(2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 502 U.S. 817 (1991). However, in
our federal legal system, the decisions of the Second Circuit
technically do not &quot;bind&quot; the numerous federal district
courts sitting in other circuits, the possibility existed that
other appellate courts might rule differently, and the
&quot;intent&quot; issue might pose a potential
&quot;defense&quot; for others who launched viral attacks until
the U.S. Supreme Court decided the question. While Morris'
conviction and sentence to three years' probation and a $10,000
fine made national headlines and were upheld, the case
highlighted the difficulty of prosecuting a viral creator who
does not necessarily intend the disasterous consequences wrought
by the infectious spread of his creation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Congress' response of creating a standard of
&quot;reckless disregard&quot; makes it both easier to prosecute
cases like <i>Morris</i> and easier for prosecutors to determine
if the act of creating a virus is chargeable. The 1994 Act makes
clear that the creator of a virus cannot hide behind the cloak
that he did not really mean to hurt anyone, or that he really
only wanted to send a message or, as in Morris' case, point out a
flaw. While the courts may need to evaluate what qualifies as
&quot;damage&quot; to a computer or computer system, as the new
Act uses those terms, it seems that any interruption in service,
which in turn causes a disruption in business, will likely
fulfill the requisite damage component. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Under the new Act, a software genius who
foolheartedly creates a &quot;benign&quot; virus that does not
actually cause a computer to crash can still be prosecuted (if
the damage is at least $1,000 in the aggregate), although the
maximum punishment is less than that to be levied upon the maker
of a &quot;malignant&quot; virus who intentionally aims at
destroying files or data. The new law constitutes a much more
responsible approach to the growing problem of computer viruses.
By specifically not defining a virus, and rather describing the
act, the drafters have left it open to cover the next wave of
technological attacks on information systems, whatever form that
may take. In differentiating the levels of offense, the new law
lines up more closely with the commonly held beliefs of what is
criminal. Clearly society would see fit to more severely punish
someone who attacks another's computer based on a grudge or the
sheer delight in creating havoc than someone who causes the
destruction of computer services due to a failure to recognize
the consequences of an attempt to &quot;show off&quot; one's
expertise. Although some degree of variation for the punishments
seem fitting, it hardly seems likely that even the less culpable
miscreant in these examples should get off without any punishment
in light of the extreme costs that such behavior can cause.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While some have continued to debate whether the
penalties are too severe or too mild, the reality of the
situation is that it will take some time for judges, prosecutors
and society to find a comfortable level of punishment. Yet as the
costs of such behavior rise, society may find itself willing to
provide harsher punishment. One example comes from England where
after the judge sentenced that nation's first convicted virus
creator to 18 months imprisonment, the judge stated, &quot;Those
who seek to reap mindless havoc on one of the vital tools of our
age cannot expect lenient treatment.&quot; Undoubtedly, business,
which faces most of these costs first-hand, will be in the
forefront of any effort to increase the penalties in order to
provide some degree of deterrence to such a costly activity.</font></p>
