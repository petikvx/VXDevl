<CENTER><P>Cyber soldiers, ones who engage in conflicts, wars or spyings
in cyber space with hackers' skill and knowledge, are comparable to soldiers
or cavalry soldiers with laces, swords or guns. The threat of cyber soldiers
have well been known, however, the threat, vulnerabilities and opportunities
of the autonomous mobile cyber weapons are yet unknown. Autonomous mobile
cyber weapon is a computer virus or program that is capable of effectively
moving from a source to specifically defined destinations and designed
for or usable in cyber wars, conflicts or spyings. The autonomous mobile
cyber weapons are capable of cruise to specific destinations where aimed
information or information systems are located and capable of carrying
out missions and certain tasks more effectively than the way in which tasks
are manually carried out by cyber soldiers, and is purchasable, untraceable
and multiplying. Implication of appearance of autonomous mobile cyber weapons
is vulnerabilities and opportunities. </P></CENTER>

<P><B>Preface </B></P>

<P>A key theme of the essay is that a novel property cruise will allow
AMCW (autonomous mobile cyber weapon) come to existence. For example, a
computer virus with the property 'cruise' can be used for military application.
In other words, the computer virus with capacity of cruse that is launched
to attack adversaries' computer systems for military purpose autonomously
travels to adversaries' computer systems and carries out missions. In this
article, discussion of the property 'cruise' is not made, but this article
was written based on the conclusion already drawn from the paper 'Behavior
Cruise'. Thus, in order to know the feasibility of cruise, which has been
the most important property that makes AMCW possible, one has to read the
paper 'Behavior Cruise'. If cruise is not possible, there will be no AMCW.
However, cruise is possible and the paper shows. </P>

<P><B>INTRODUCTION </B></P>

<P>Vulnerabilities of computer systems by intruders (hackers) are well
known. Those hackers who engage in a battle or a spying in cyberspace are
cyber soldiers. Cyber soldiers use particular programs in the battles or
spyings. These programs are cyber weapons, such as, critters. </P>

<P>For cyber wars or conflicts, computer viruses or worms have been receiving
great interests from military as computer viruses or worms are mobile and
autonomous, and has nature of anonymity and cheap and easy to make. ('virus'
also referring to 'worm') However, military applications of computer viruses
are somewhat no progress. However, it is still considered as a kind of
cyber weapon to be used by cyber soldiers. Cyber soldiers intrude adversaries'
computer systems and plant a destructive program, whether virus or trojan
horse. </P>

<P>The primary and critical function that virus was lacked in military
application was the ability of cruise from a source to specific destinations
by itself, e.g. adversaries' computers. Thousands of viruses have been
found, however, none of them have cruise ability. However, appearance of
computer virus or a program that has the ability of cruise to spy or disrupt
adversaries' information and/or information systems is very likely, and
will dramatically change the way waging wars or conflicts in cyberspace.
</P>

<P>An autonomous mobile cyber weapons (AMCW) is a program that is capable
of cruising to specifically defined or aimed destinations (organizations
of adversaries) and obtaining, destroying or manipulating data against
adversaries by itself without assist or control. </P>

<P>AMCWs are powerful and have advantage over cyber soldiers whose tasks
are largely depend upon manual operations, sometime tedious and comparatively
higher risks in disclosing identity of cyber soldiers while disclosures
of the identity are not wanted. </P>

<P>A new capability of computer virus, cruise, will revolutionize the way
waging wars, conflict or spying in cyberspace. </P>

<P><B>CYBER SOLDIERS </B></P>

<P>Hackings, intruding or penetrating, have already shown the feasibility
of offensive use, and vulnerability of existing information systems.1 When
these skills, tools and knowledge of hackers are applied to soldiers who
engage in wars or conflicts in cyberspace against adversaries, then the
solders are called cyber soldiers. In fact, the cyber soldiers' some potentiality
has been demonstrated by many incidents of hackers' intrusions. The publicized
recent incidents of intrusions (very unfortunately, these intrusion incidents
have been committed against legitimate governmental organizations, however,
these incidents still gave us lessons) to WWW servers of CIA, U.S department
of Justice and U.S. Air Force showed how cyber soliders from adversaries
wuld harm or disrupt, however, do not necessarily demonstrate the real
danger posed to critical information and information systems of military,
air traffics or financial institutions. These vulnerabilities and opportunities
with cyber soldiers potential capabilities will energize to escalate birth
of more systematically trained cyber soldiers, units and training institutions
in every nation. 2 </P>

<P><B>COMPUTER VIRUS </B></P>

<P>Computer virus has been a subject for military application3 while feasibility
and potentiality of offensive use of it and vulnerabilities have already
been known. Future military use of an intelligent agent is also conjectured.4
There may be confusion between agents, computer virus, web crawling robot,
computer program and cybership; all these are collectively called programs.
</P>

<P>Despite speculation, efforts and expectations in millitary application
of computer virus, capabilities of military use of computer viruses is
very limited or prevented. The matter is not agents or virus. The biggest
obstruction that prevented these programs from being used for offense and
a defensive means was the absence of the cruise property 5. Cyber soldiers
have to plant viruses on adversaries' computers otherwise viruses wander
and spread to all directions than reaching destination, adversaries' computers,
when a virus is released, for example, on a military purpose. Chance of
reaching adversaries by releasing a virus is consider very low, so cyber
solders must plant the virus into adversaries, without cyber soldiers,
the virus is meaningless like a lance is mere an object if no solder carries
and skillfully handle it. The poor mobility of computer virus makes it
an annoyance than real crutical threat and impracticable as a self-contained
autonomous mobile weapon in military. So far, a visible threat is hacking.
</P>

<P>Computer viruses, so far, exhibited a number of major properties, growth,
aiming-at-data, untraceability, self-nonself determination, self-preservation,
execution and reaction (or response). These properties except untraceability
are subject to execution of viruses. Execution property is that viruses
need execution of viruses code in order to be active. If the viruses aren't
executed, the viruses are mere stream of binary code.6 The growth is a
behavior in which a program replicates or mutates and it results growth
in number of copies or number of different kinds. Aiming-at-data is a property
that we can observe among some viruses that manipulating and destroying
data, which is not necessary to the its growth. The Self-preservation property
normally exhibits attempt to avoid detection in order to preserve existence.
Response is yet another property that virus has appropriate reactions to
circumstance. Self-nonself determination allows a program to determine
self from nonself, however, accurate determination of successors is not
guaranteed for a virus that is capable of mutate in large number of different
shapes. Untraceability prevents from tracing offender or author or launcher
who developer and/or release a (malicious or offensive) program. </P>

<P>Combinations of these properties that are shown in conventional computer
viruses prevent or limit military applications of computer virus unless
cyber solders secretively carry and deliver to the adversaries' computer.
</P>

<P>Properties that are expected to appear in computer virus in near future
are self-learning, communications and cruise. Cruise is a behavior of computer
program, allowing programs to travel toward destinations, a computer or
an organization, from a source 7, and is the the essential property of
AMCWs, and very desired for offensive use of a program. Self-learning will
allow programs to respond to the circumstance and make the program sophisticated
and powerful, allowing chance of survival of programs higher. Communication
property allows programs to communicate autonomously, without or with self-learning
ability, between programs or between programs and a (control) center directly
or indirectly. Computer viruses or AMCWs with new properties and more advanced
techniques based on existing properties are expected. Especially application
of cruise and self-learning property to a program, i.e. viruses or AMCWs,
will be critical. </P>

<P>We used to believe that computer virus tends to grow in number and produce
exact copies of itself. We became astonished when this belief became false
by observing a tiny electrical creature that mutates. It was novel that
how a tiny and trivial program can mutate as complex biological creatures
do. A virus that mutates was novel at early 90s is called polymorphic virus
or polymorphic type virus. In few years later, one of our other beliefs
had again been smashed. We used to believe that computer viruses aren't
transparent in terms of platforms or operating systems that a virus infecting
programs 8 on MS-DOS can't infect programs on non-DOS, such as Mac or Unix.
Now, all believe that a virus can both infect programs on DOS and programs
in Unix or MacOS or other operating system. Simply, all of us didn't understand
the simple nature of viruses. What would be next surprises? Some of us
still can believe that computer viruses will remain as simple as today
in complexities, attributes and its applications (vandalism, hobby or research).
More surprise will come and shatter our faith in computer virus. We may
be too confident in computer viruses; computer viruses are one of subjects
about which we know very little, though some would not agree. </P>

<P>The polymorphic added increased security warning against computer viruses
and lessons to antivirus community. In order to detect polymorphic type,
current scanning technology can't do the job without false positive alarm
(over detection). In fact, the polymorphic viruses that we have seen are
rather primitive than the one, could appear in near future, that is capable
of changing patterns and behaviors to vast number of different combinations
to make detection difficult. When every possible different patterns (compositions
of the virus that are likely to be found in other viruses, especially successors)
of a virus is greater, the greater false alarms for current scanning techniques.
However, if there is a great number of viruses or AMCWs to detect and all
have great number of possibly different patterns, then they will be even
greater chance of false alarm for existing scanning technologies. </P>

<P>Computer viruses won't remain as trivial programs that can be annoyance
than a real threat and are all detected by one of our favorable antivirus
software before occurring serious damages. Unfortunately, there are a lot
space in which virus can grow. Computer viruses will out grow beyond most
us think today. It's no doubt that computer viruses will be far more advanced
in near future. And novel property like cruise will bring new era to cyber
combats beyond vandalism. </P>

<P><B>AMCW </B></P>

<P>What if there is a robot9 that is launched can autonomously travel to
an aimed or defined destination, an organization of an adversary, to disrupt
and spy classified information. Is there such a robot that can travel hundreds
of thousands of kilometers without being detected and carries out mission
and without disclosing sender of the robot in case captured? It is possible
in cyberspace. What make it possible is the property cruise, i.e. behavior
cruise. The cruise property will enable computer virus powerful ever in
terms of military and police use against adversaries and illicit groups.
Conventional computer viruses, so far, are able to wander around computers
and computer networks and some with some targets such as specific antivirus
programs, e.g. removing signature data from virus scanners. The Internet
worm10 spreaded and infected hundreds of unix machines on Internet were
also wandered without having specific destinations. Conventional computer
viruses also don't have ability to cruise to aimed or defined destinations
but wander and spread if ever launched and it will spread in all directions
and would be found in everywhere that the viruses could infect. However,
the cruise property makes computer virus possible to cruise to specifically
defined destinations. A program or virus that has cruise property can be
launched to attack specific organizations of adversaries. The launched
virus with cruise property will secretively cruise and arrive at the destination
by itself and carries out missions. It can try million times until succeeding
missions given and without risks or with very little risks of disclosing
identity of the sender or offender, unlike manual operations by cyber soldiers.
</P>

<P>Conventional computer viruses are autonomous and mobile, however, it
is very inadequate to be an weapon because viruses wander without reaching
to specific targets. It may be appropriate terrorists weapons, nondiscriminatorily
destructive. So computer virus itself is ineffective to be autonomous mobile
cyber weapon but cyber weapons for cyber soldiers who can intrude and plant
a virus into adversaries. However, conventional computer viruses with cruise
property makes critical difference. Conventional computer virus can be
a full AMCW with the property, cruise. It can cruise to adversaries without
cyber soldiers, but by itself. A virus or a program has property cruise
is called a cybership, especially cyberships designed for or usable in
cyber wars or conflicts are called an AMCW. An AMCW is a program or virus
that has the property cruise and designed for or usable in cyber wars,
conflicts or spyings, is autonomous and mobile. </P>

<P>Thus, AMCWs are capable of traveling autonomously to a destination,
adversary's organization, and obtaining data or disrupt information and/or
information systems. </P>

<P>In myth, our favorable antivirus program can detects all or 99 percent
of viruses. The belief could be true for viruses that are written by someone's
spare time, in a week, day or even an hour, for his/her emotional satisfaction.
Since the autonomous mobile cyber weapons are considered a type of computer
virus, AMCWs can be detectable by an antivirus program, for which we pay
$100 of its use. However, it's very skeptical that AMCWs that are built
or purchased to obtain priceless information or to destroy adversaries
information or disrupt information systems are easily detected by our favorable
antivirus programs before the AMCWs achieving its missions. Most conventional
computer viruses may be made for one's emotional satisfactions or other
personal interests while AMCWs will be built and purchased for survival
and win battles. Conventional computer viruses are neither threatening
national security nor serious while AMCWs are serious and threatening.
</P>

<P><B>CYBER SOLDIERS AND AMCWS </B></P>

<P>Computer intrusions by computer hackers have already been known the
feasibility in military application and vulnerabilities in information
infrastructure.11 However the threat and vulnerabilities caused by AMCWs
haven't yet been studied and known. The manual operations by cyber soldiers
(hacking) can carry out most of missions that AMCWs could achieve. Similarly
hacking is replaceable with AMCWs. AMCWs can substitute hacking the way
robots replace human workers in factories and gain same products with different
productivity. Hackers in cyberwar may be comparable to foot-soldiers with
lances, swords or guns while AMCWs may be comparable to robot soldiers
as well as autonomous (not remote controlled) military equipments, warships,
airplanes, cruise missiles, etc. </P>

<P>In fact, unnecessarily, hacking and launching an AMCW are alternative
to each other but also supplementary because both means have many differences.
There are difference between hackings and launching AMCWs. Productivity,
transferability, morality, number of entity, mobility and traceability
are those differences. Achieving same goals by either means take different
cost and time, one can be advanced over the other means for certain tasks.
The techniques and know-how that are attached to hackers are not easily
transferred to adversaries, however, know-how and capacity of AMCWs can
be shared by both parties as AMCWs are purchasable. Cyber soldiers don't
make physical movement in order to penetrate and carry out mission while
an AMCW can make trip to destination where targets are located. Hacking
are easily traceable than AMCWs as an AMCW is a type of computer virus
that is capable of cruise; computer virus has an attribute of untraceability.
Cyber solders have intrinsic morality and humanity and are affected by
an ethic, and are unlikely against their country, organization to which
they belong, family and friends to which they're emotionally attached.
AMCWs, by contrast, have no morality and are not affected by an ethic,
and will act upon missions given to accomplish beyond everything. Cyber
soldiers are not wounded or killed in a cyber battle so the number of cyber
soldiers and capacity of cyber soldiers in a group or unit are remained
constant unless more soldiers are added or dismissed. Thus, amount of tasks
or missions that cyber solders can carry out is limited. Meanwhile, AMCWs
multiply and grow in number as much as needed. An AMCW launched can have
hundreds or thousands of different copies that may have same or different
missions. </P>

<P>When virus is an alternative to hacking and hacking is alternative to
virus in a circumstance, one would choose whichever better means. The choice
would be made by parties who wage cyberwars or conflicts. However, in general
AMCWs are not alternative to hackings and hackings are not alternative
to AMCWs but cooperative, thus both hacking and launching AMCWs are required,
for offensive and defensive purpose. </P>

<P><B>VULNERABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES </B></P>

<P>Vulnerabilities of one's information systems by cyber attacks are opportunities
for one's adversary. Equally, an adversary's vulnerabilities are one's
opportunities. </P>

<P>Do we need commanders and strategies and units to launch an AMCW? It's
unlikely that there are needs of large staffs or expensive equipments or
commanders. But all it takes is: purchasing a right AMCW or AMCWs generating
software; choosing destinations and targets; and click the button 'Yes',
for example, on the following message: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An AMCW that will cruise to ABC organization (destination for the AMCW)
for obtaining classified data and altering some of them (target) is now
ready to launch. Chance of accomplishment of the mission is 80%. This AMCW
can cause tremendous damage and disrupt to the organization or delay functions
of the organization when it is launched. </P>

<CENTER><P>Launching the AMCW? </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>[Yes] [No] </P></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>AMCWs can be very self-contained, it can be purchased, just like military
buying weapons or groups buying drugs or weapons or illegal fire-arms from
black markets. An AMCW is a program, can easily be transferred and delivered
over computer networks or any other conventional delivery channels to anywhere
in the world for the buyers. How do we detect or monitor an AMCW, a computer
program, is being delivered or transferred to buyers from developers over
illegitimate channels and for illegal purpose. Since AMCWs can be used
for legitimate purposes like missiles and tanks without threatening to
kill people unlike missiles, tanks, biological or chemical weapons. (Since
cyber weapons, for example, can possibly target to malfunction medical
equipments, it is not entirely true that cyber weapons don't threaten to
harm or kill people.) Trades and research &amp; developments of AMCWs would
not be completely banned. Rather AMCWs would be an important part of arm-race.
</P>

<P>Since AMCWs aren't easily traceable, especially when an AMCW is designed
untraceable, it would be impossible to trace complete trails along which
the AMCW cruised. As AMCWs are a type of computer viruses that can cruise,
the some attribute of computer viruses are also applicable to AMCWs. How
do we catch one who make and spread computer virus on purpose? The characteristic
of AMCWs allow malicious groups, governments, businesses to launch AMCWs
on behalf of them without risks or with very little risks of being caught
or being disclosed as an offender or aggressor. Unlike tanks and missiles,
AMCWs can have property of untraceability, which allows launcher of AMCWs
remain anonymous if desired. A fear of using conventional weapons, such
as missiles and nuclear arms, is consequences, counter-attack, diplomatic
and political consequences. When aggressor or offender can remain anonymous,
the fear is not applicable any more. Thus, commitment of cyber attacks
with AMCWs can largely be depend upon morality of organizations or group
of people or even an individual due to absence of the fear. </P>

<P>The number of attacks or attempting attacks by hackers is limited by
time and number of cyber soldiers to be working with in a group for a mission.
The number of attempting attacks or attacks by AMCWs isn't limited. AMCWs
can attempt to attack countless times until succeed or repeating attacks
unless all AMCWs are detected and eliminated or malfunctioned. AMCWs grow
in number as many as needed from a single copy released by a mouse button,
and spread into many different locations and launch attacks for various
entries or for targets if already arrived at destination where targets
are located. Single mouse click brings enormous effects that are not comparable
to the result brought by manual operations of cyber soldiers. </P>

<P>One mouse click could result pouring bombardments on every targeted
adversaries' government or military computer for every month or even every
day with existing security system under which the governments, military
and businesses are being operated. </P>

<P><B>CYBER REFUGEE </B></P>

<P>Adversaries are relatively anyone who disagrees or is rival or uncooperative
with another can become adversaries. Use of AMCWs can damage adversaries
by destroying and altering data or obtaining secretive and valuable data.
</P>

<P>Use of AMCWs would not be restricted to defence and surveillance against
State adversaries, terrorist, gang, drug cartel, etc. Conflict between
political, religious parties/factions nations, illicit groups, businesses,
etc. for law enforcement, defense, offense or on their particular interest.
Businesses may enter cyberspace intelligence rivalries, and role of AMCWs
would be important. An executive of a U.S. company said &quot;If we're
willing to do dirty tricks for the defense part of national security, then
why aren't we able to do dirty tricks for the economic part of national
security?&quot;. 12 </P>

<P>Are AMCWs necessary? Should R&amp;D on AMCWs and and trades of them
be banned? AMCWs may not be something unfavorable tool for our societies
that desire cooperation than confrontation, and morality than wickedness.
Can any authority effectively stop producing computer viruses? AMCWs are
a type of computer virus that is much more complicated than the conventional
computer virus that we already seen. Since there is no way to prevent some
nation and organization from developing AMCWs or AMCWs generating tools
and selling them, there least must be defense means available. How do we
defend or detect AMCWs intruding into private space? The vulnerabilities
won't be gone away, may be never, though there would be some means to defend
effectively within some degree. </P>

<P>Refugee of cyberwar are those civilians who wedged between nations,
businesses and other organizations waging cyberwars with AMCWs and can't
defend themselves, are forced to disconnect from computer networks or is
unable to use their computers due to fear of attacks or denial of services.
Those civilians wouldn't be access to sophisticated defense tools to protect
their computer systems from being intruded by AMCWs and silently using
their computer resources as temporary staying harbors and their privacy
is being intruded. Even the wars or conflicts and all the technologies
are too complicated to comprehend for those civilians, cyber refugee. </P>

<P><B>CONCLUSION </B></P>

<P>Great threats and vulnerabilities that have not been known are the cyber
attacks by AMCWs. AMCWs are programs or computer viruses that have cruise
ability, desgined for or usable in cyber conflicts, wars or spyings. Despite
interests in military applications of computer viruses, there has been
no progress in its application. It is due to the absence of critical element
in a computer virus. No conventional computer viruses that are appeared
have capability to autonomously travel to destinations (organizations or
computers), where targets may be located. This property made offensive
use of computer virus ineffective. However, application of the property,
cruise, to a computer program, i.e. computer virus or worm, will allow
new era to begin in cyberspace. AMCWs are new and would be severe threats
ever known in cyberspace. </P>

<P>Since AMCWs can be a type of computer virus, AMCWs inherit properties
of computer virus. Major properties of computer viruses that are inherited
are untraceability, growth. New critical property is cruise and another
very likelihood property is purchasability. AMCWs or AMCWs generators would
be purchasable the way arms are traded legally or even illegally. And AMCWs
or AMCWs generators will be ready to be used by pressing a mouse button
after specifying a destination and missions. A nature of AMCWs, untraceability,
that eliminate risks of consequences that offender, aggressor or criminal
may face after disclosure of their identity is untraceability. It prevents
identifying the one who launched AMCWs. No one would be able to prevent
one time friend nations from sending AMCWs on behalf of their economic
benefit. And no one would be able to identify who has send the AMCWs, unlike
hacking, computer viruses do not leave trail. Growth, mobility and cruise
properties make AMCWs powerful and superior means over manual operations
of cyber attacks. AMCWs can change shapes into large number of different
shapes and travel to different locations and launch attacks to intrude
or to obtain/destroy/manipulate data, which is target, if already successfully
intruded. </P>

<P>These natures that AMCWs can have make AMCWs ideal offensive and defensive
tools. Failure to respond to these real threats will be that we will witness
frequent attacks, even every day, and disruptions and damages by AMCWs
that was launched by mouse buttons of someone who can not be found. One's
vulnerabilities are adversaries' opportunities. Equally, adversaries' vulnerabilities
are opportunities for one who could attack and take advantage of the vulnerabilities.
</P>

<P>Information systems are vulnerable by attacks of autonomous mobile cyber
weapons, AMCWs. The attack is real threats by which we may become cyber
refugees. Many or some naive and powerless citizens and employees may become
pawn or refugee in cyber battles that they don't understand. </P>

<P>The novel property of computer virus cruise will revolutionize the way
we wage wars and spyings in cyberspace, and will create vulnerabilities
and opportunities. </P>

<P>1 A study of on ease of penetration (or tolerance) by computer attackers
was discussed, see [SC]. </P>

<P>The study on how intrusion could effect ATCCS (Army Tactical Command
and Control System)'s functions, command and control by hackers was discussed
at [Schwartau 94]. The study is known to be originated from &quot;RFP No:
DAAL01-93-R-2900, Closing Data:28 Sep 92. U.S. Army Labcom, Fort Monmouth,
NY 07703-5601&quot;. Interesting point was that the study used a software
to simulate hackers attacks. Focus of study was on what's effect of ATCCS's
function after break-in into the computer system than tolerance of intruding.
See [Schwartau 94]. This study, like other studies, wasn't aware of attacks
by autonomous cyber weapons, i.e. cyberships, but cyber soldiers, i.e.
hackers. AMCWs, for example, can attempt to attack in large number of time
from many difference locations. </P>

Study on military application of computer virus was carried out by a military

carrying out computer virus into adversary by air. Half a million dollar
was known to be granted for the study project. See [Schwartau 94] Page
