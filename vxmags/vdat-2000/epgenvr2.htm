<H3>Abstract</H3>

<P>A brief summary of research on the ethical development of four individuals
involved in the virus writing subculture is given, followed by an examination
of the current virus writing &quot;scene&quot;. A completely different
type of virus writer is introduced. Recent developments, trends and forecasts
are presented, and some suggestions for minimizing the impact of virus
writers both globally and organizationally are considered. </P>

<H3>The Generic Virus Writer - A Brief History</H3>

<P>Even in areas of scientific investigation, there can be the danger of
overgeneralisation and stereotyping. In the case of virus writers, one
manifestation of this danger has been that of assuming that there existed
some homogeneous group of people who write viruses, that they were all
ethically deviant, and that it was possible to talk about the psychology
of &quot;the&quot; virus writer. It was with this in mind that we undertook
our original research, which resulted in proving that there is no such
thing as the generic or homogenous virus writer. Along the way, we also
learned that the virus writers we spoke with were totally within the norms
for ethical development. However, we were still left with unanswered questions
-- the foremost being &quot;How do you stop people from writing viruses&quot;.
Following a brief summary of earlier findings, we will examine some of
the issues which may help us answer this question. </P>

<P><A HREF="epgenvir.htm">The Generic Virus Writer</A> (TGVW) [1], completed
in 1994, presented four case studies of individuals involved in the virus
writing subculture. The research data was obtained in part by using surveys,
and interviews, arranged via electronic mail (e-mail ), electronic chat
and in-person sessions. Information relating to the subjects' relationships,
perception of self and others including family and peer group, family history,
and cognitive reasoning ability was collected. This data was used to examine
the individuals' moral development in light of ethical and moral developmental
models based on the research of Lawrence Kohlberg [2]. (Gender based issues
in virus writing were examined using the model developed by Carole Gilligan
[3]). The individuals were selected from four categories: </P>

<UL>
<LI>early adolescent</LI>

<LI>college student</LI>

<LI>adult/professionally employed individual</LI>

<LI>ex-writer of viruses</LI>
</UL>

<P>The first three categories appeared to be generally representative of
the comparatively small [4] virus writing population. The ex-virus writer
was an anomaly for reasons which we are yet unable to measure. In TGVW,
we traced ethical development of one individual chosen from each of the
four categories. We found these individuals to be within the norms for
ethical development as defined by longitudinal studies done by Kohlberg
[5]. Based on our findings, we predicted that the youngest of the virus
writers would slowly begin to disassociate himself from virus writing.
We showed how we expected the next oldest person to stop writing viruses
very soon, and stated we expected the ex-virus writer to continue to refrain
from virus writing. We felt the adult could easily continue to distribute
viruses, as he had passed the age range during which one would be expected
to disassociate from the behaviour. Over the past three years (two years
since the presentation of the original work), we have maintained contact
with three of the four subjects. Let us examine how well we managed to
predict the paths they would follow, based on our research and Kohlberg's
model. </P>

<P>The adult in our original study initially exhibited an ethical developmental
model lower than average for his age. Whereas adult males typically are
shown to have development on the Kohlberg scale of at least 4, and sometimes
5, our adult did not demonstrate a 5 (or 6) at any time. He has, unfortunately
but unsurprisingly, continued to distribute viruses. He remains a polite
and interesting, albeit controversial, individual. </P>

<P>The young man categorized as an adolescent [typical Level 1 Stage 2]
in our earlier research is now, obviously, an older adolescent. He has
apparently shifted from virus writing into virus distribution. He publicly,
amongst his peers, states virus writing is &quot;wrong&quot;. He has, however,
continued to be involved in the virus writing subculture, although to a
lesser degree than two years ago. He appears to be progressing quite normally
for his age, into Level 2 Stage 3. </P>

<P>The college student has continued to exhibit an interest he expressed
during our previous conversations -- programming and communications. He
has indeed stopped writing viruses and has become professionally employed
in the software industry, where he has held respected positions of considerable
responsibility. </P>

<P>If research in the field of ethical development shows us anything, it
shows us there are some reliable standard models and that behaviour in
one setting does not typify necessarily behaviour in other settings. </P>

<P>Integration of morality becomes more consistent, however, as one ages.
This is exemplified by the progression of this student. He initially stated
virus writing was wrong, but that it was basically okay if he did it in
a way he considered to be non-harmful. Specifically, he never intended
for any of his viruses to affect users. &quot;I wrote viruses for several
reasons, I suppose, but primarily they were for my own personal learning.&quot;
Later, after being confronted by a user who had in fact caught one of his
viruses, he publicly stated that not only was virus writing harmful, but
a wrong action for himself as well as others, regardless of intent. He
then stated he would no longer write viruses. Upon pressure from peers,
he stated he was going to live up to his words, and not do it any more.
To the best of our knowledge, he has held true to this statement. We asked
him why he had not gone back to virus writing despite observed pressure
from peers. &quot;There are probably four main reasons I have remained
retired&quot;, he stated. &quot;First of all, I value my word very highly,
and while I made no promises when I retired, I still feel compelled to
maintain what I stated&quot;. Time constraints, personal involvement and
no real reason to do it were cited as the other reasons. His Level 2 Stage
4 ethical responses from two years ago appear to have progressed quite
normally into Level 3, Stage 5 post-conventional morality. For those who
are ethically within behavioral norms, but who are involved in the virus
writing subculture, &quot;aging out&quot; still seems to be the main force
which contributes to their stopping the actual virus writing. As they age,
they are less vulnerable to peer pressure and begin to integrate what they
know is right behaviour into their actions, until eventually they simply
do the right things no matter what the situation is. Whether or not it
will become the norm for those who age out of the behaviour of virus writing
to remain as part of the subculture has not yet been determined. </P>

<P>The ex-virus writer from our original study has continued to maintain
a good relationship with both parents and girlfriend. He has continued
his non-involvement in virus writing. At the time of our original project,
he stated he had worked as a volunteer in the library and hospital environments.
Since that time, he has done work for a major software company, and continues
to be trustworthy, talented and a positive example for the younger individuals.
He has this to say regarding peer pressure: </P>

<P><I>&quot;They know that I have stopped; it's pretty obvious, at any
rate. I don't feel excluded in any way simply because coding isn't everything;
most of the people never coded to any significant degree to begin with.
Anyway, I'm fun to talk to :) Or not. Maybe they just tolerate me. But
I think most of them like me whether or not I coded. Who I am and what
I've done only gives them more incentive to talk to me when I first meet
them. At this point its irrelevant; it just makes me the alpha male of
the pack. So I can bully people around :)&quot;</I> </P>

<P>To reiterate our original position: </P>

<P><I>&quot;Little reason exists to believe that crime and delinquency
can be eliminated merely by the fear of legal punishment alone. More evidence
exists that fear of social disapproval and informal penalties, criticisms
and punishments from parents and friends may actually be a greater deterrent
to crime than legal punishments&quot; </I>[6]. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to Top</A></P>

<P><A NAME="QUESTIONS"></A></P>

<H3>The Unanswered Questions</H3>

<P>During any discussion of virus writers, the question can arise: &quot;Why
did they do it?&quot; Their own answers and justifications still vary.
Reasons for writing viruses which have been cited include relief from boredom,
actively seeking fame, exploration, malice, and peer pressure. </P>

<P>There does, however, seem to be a notable absence of one reason which
at one time was thought by some to be a factor in encouraging virus production:
the vX BBS. According to one respondent (and this thought was mirrored
by many), </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;I don't think that the vX BBS was ever a real incentive for
new viruses. I think that Todor's BBS was unique in this regard because
of timing. At the time (forget that BBS' name; virus exchange?), very few
viruses were readily available. And so it was difficult for novices who
weren't proficient in assembly to learn how to write viruses. The best
way to learn (at least Vesselin seems to make us think this way) was to
call up the BBS and download Vienna, disassemble, and churn out new variants.
By the time viruses became big in the U.S., I think that virus production
had accelerated elsewhere in the world to feed the vX scene continuously.
So U.S. people were lazy and didn't need to write viruses; they just needed
to be good collectors. Additionally, the U.S. bbs's had a pitifully large
number of non-viruses. Ambulance Car and the SPAM fiasco come to mind.
I have yet to see a 'WWW virus scene' develop (is ILF on WWW?) I think
the interesting thing to do on the WWW is to create a page which automates
virus creation; i.e. set the parameters, run g2/ps-mpc, and return file
to the user. the only thing really stopping this is the lack of source
code for most virus generators. So the short answer is that the motivation
for writing viruses hasn't changed much. These People write to get famous
or because they're bored.&quot;</I></P>
</UL>

<P>Is the way to stop them simply to allow them to grow up? This would
be a viable solution if there were not new ones coming along to step into
their shoes. We will now turn our attention to the current virus writing
scene, i.e. the &quot;Next Generation Virus Writers&quot;, discussing the
current crop of virus writers and exploring their impact on the general
computing population. We will briefly examine their responses to recent
legal decisions related to virus writing, and to &quot;acceptable use policies&quot;
of Internet service providers and universities as we consider how these
young people can best be dissuaded from writing and distributing viruses.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to Top</A></P>

<P><A NAME="NEXT"></A></P>

<H3>The Next Generation</H3>

<P>Who are the Next Generation Virus Writers? Initially, upon reentering
the old haunts of what was once the virus underground, we found ourselves
met by what appeared to be a violent, mouthy, nasty group of obnoxious
kids who had nothing better to do than talk about ways to hurt people and
destroy information. It was only a matter of a few days and a few conversations
before what had been so apparent (and what has provided many journalist
with sensationalistic fodder) was in fact found to be much the same type
of &quot;show&quot; which we had observed years before. Actors, roles and
scripts are used not only on stages, but in communications between adolescent
peers [7]. </P>

<P>It initially appeared that some of the new breed were much leaner, meaner
and more technologically advanced, but while we eventually determined there
was some evidence of a heightened awareness of technology, for the most
part these virus writers' abilities were generally observed to be comparable
to those of their predecessors. There are some exceptions: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;I guess people may write to be famous, but in my opinion, the
better the AV programs get, the more motivated some people will be. I for
example get my motivation from challenging AV programs. As they get more
advanced (i.e. better behaviour blocking, heuristics, etc.,) the more of
a challenge and therefore motivation there is. People in it just for the
fame generally fail...there has to be some technical motivation&quot;.</I></P>
</UL>

<P>The geographical hot zones had changed. Australia and Sweden/Norway
now seem to dominate the virus scene. This should be no surprise: the scene
was Bulgarian [8] before it was Canadian, and for a while it was American.
Quoting an anonymous source: <I>&quot;The Internet in general -- anonymous,
cheap, global communications. Better than any BBS.&quot; &quot; The Internet
has enabled us to spread the scene around. its easier to talk directly
with people from around the world about viruses&quot;,</I> said another
virus writer, <I>&quot;though very little has gotten done in the past few
years, at least from the standpoint of organized virus groups.&quot;</I>
In fact, most of the virus writers thought the good old days were gone
for good. When asked for comments about the relative stability of the virus
writing scene during the course of this study, we received various comments.
</P>

<P>Rock Steady, former front man for the virus writing group known as NuKE,
was said to have a <I>&quot;dead end job as a bank teller or parking attendant&quot;.</I>
Aristotle, sometimes NuKE, sometimes not, was frequently cited as still
&quot;on the scene&quot;, and it was suggested by many that he appears
to be a permanent fixture. To quote one individual, <I>&quot;Aristotle
never changes. He needs his own little world ... so cannot risk changing
it.&quot;</I> Few people remembered the name Masud Khafir, and many of
the other FIDONet Virus and Virus_Info participants were not mentioned
at all. Groups that once dominated the scene were almost a non-issue. According
to one virus writer, </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;There was a funny pattern that emerged from the virus scene
-- rabid begat yam begat NuKE begat VLAD. The groups are all the same.
They crave attention yet lack talent. They talk loudly but have no substance
behind it. It's pretty sad. Damn near every one of the VLAD viruses is
part of the &quot;intended family&quot;. Another group, dc, appears to
be thought of as somewhat of a successor to NuKE.&quot;</I></P>
</UL>

<P>Another virus writer, used this word-play to comment on one of the Australian-based
groups: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;VLAD went for total global domination. At least they INTENDED
to&quot;.</I></P>
</UL>

<P>The ages of the virus writers still varied, with one virus writer stating
age 20 appeared to be the average age of his peers. Questioned further,
he stated he had in fact asked them and that 20 was both the median and
mode, with 20.74 being the mean age. We have no idea how large his sample
was, but do admire his approach. The views we found on social life, society,
and anti-virus software have not changed much: i.e. there was still no
Generic Virus Writer. </P>

<P>Universities seem to be spawning more virus writers now, but this is
not surprising. At the recent IFIP TC11 Conference in Samos, Greece, a
workshop for Education and Information Security [9] was held, during which
one professor stated he was aware of some virus writers in his University,
but they were in another department, not his. This seemed to be a matter
of little concern for him and in fact, he had virus writing as an acceptable
&quot;exercise&quot; in one of his security courses. Another professor
has been observed on the WWW, offering NATAS as a simple virus for new
assembler students to &quot;examine&quot;[10]. The role of students is
usually to learn, and with viruses being taught or tacitly condoned, we
should not be suprised at the form of education or its outcome in these
circumstances. </P>

<P>There was a more heightened awareness of &quot;responsible behaviour&quot;
on the part of the people we spoke with, and they were willing to discuss
this with us in depth. We found that in spite of this willingness to discuss
the issue, the definition of what constitutes responsible behaviour was
varied. Generally, making viruses available via CD-ROM, FTP, or BBS to
the willing/knowing was seen as responsible management of viruses. While
we were unable at this time to do extensive survey or study of these virus
writers, the fact that the slightly-older virus writers appear to be within
ethical norms, with the exception of their activities related to viruses,
leads us to hypothesize that viruses are not seen as the &quot;bad things&quot;
they once were. </P>

<P>The majority of virus writers we talked to have much more clearly defined
goals than were found in the &quot;good old days&quot;. Programming and
other jobs in computer related fields dominate. Some of them already have
such jobs. This brings us to the next topic, the Next Age Virus Writer.
To be sure, there is a new breed of virus writers. However, we suggest
to you that it is not merely the old breed repackaged and gently aged:
not the young, bored, fame-seeking youth of the past, residing in different
countries with the same general skillset which we have just discussed.
Certainly, that sort of virus writer still exists. We see him embodied
in viruses like Boza[11]. He is the sort of virus writer who forces software
prices up by flooding the market with simple viruses which are more annoyances
and irritations than real threats. Most of his creations are never even
found in the wild and if the numbers game would self-destruct, his impact
would be even more minimal [12]. However, the virus writers who appear
to be having the real impact are those with real skills, talent and perseverance
- programmers with style and elegance, who, unlike virus writers of the
past, could make a living writing real software. According to an ex-virus
writer who wishes to remain anonymous: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;You have to be smarter today than you had to back when the
scene started simply because viruses today incorporate so many features.
Polymorphism, for example, was unheard of 5 or 6 years ago (ok, not unheard
of, but it was not a standard technique). Today, if you can't do poly,
don't even bother. Stealth, too, is something that you simply must know
how to do. Viruses are more sophisticated than ever.&quot;</I> He continued:
</P>

<P><I>&quot;So you either have to be smarter or more experienced, i.e.
older, than you had to be in the past. I think most people who were in
the scene have aged out and stopped, as you say. As for people starting,
I haven't heard of too many newcomers to the scene. Have you?&quot;</I></P>
</UL>

<P>While we must not underestimate the contributions of user apathy and
global connectivity, we are now technologically somewhat more prepared
for the types of virus virus writers we have discussed so far. However,
we are not prepared for the new spawn of virus writing subculture: The
New Age Virus Writer. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to Top</A></P>

<P><A NAME="SECRETS"></A></P>

<H3>No More Secrets: Demystification and Legitimization</H3>

<P>As we have shown, much of the secretive atmosphere which was pervasive
throughout the virus writing underground has given way to a new openness.
This openness has been facilitated in part by a the media. In WIRED, we
find <I>&quot;Viruses Are Good for You&quot;</I>[13] suggesting that many
of the <I>&quot;most promising visions of how to coordinate the far-flung
communication and computing cycles .....converge on a controversial solution:
the use of self-replicators that roam the Net.&quot;</I> The individuals
examined as virus writers in the article are referred to as &quot;developers
interested in harnessing the power of self-replicating programs, scientists
interested in the abstract behaviours of viruses&quot;, and &quot;unnamed
renegades of the virus writing underground&quot;. The article goes on to
discuss the virus as a fascinating and powerful life form, seen by the
creators as useful for &quot;the fertile creation of yet more powerful
digital devices&quot; and &quot;reckless individual expression&quot;. The
anti-virus community is described at one point as &quot;nervously policing
the boundary between the great unwashed and those trustworthy enough to
handle 'live' specimens......the world of anti-virus research offered its
initiates a thrill somewhere between the delightful romance of butterfly
collecting and the grim camaraderie of working for the National Security
Agency&quot;. Mark Ludwig, one of the subjects discussed in the article,
is described as wandering the &quot;lonely intellectual wilderness reserved
for those who practice science on the fringe, outside the cozy realms of
institutional affiliation, professional consensus or methodological decorum&quot;.
While the article does suggest Ludwig could present his subject with a
little more sober attention to devising anti-virus countermeasures, it
does not draw any conclusion on his contribution to the legitimization
of virus writing. It does not mention the impact of the viruses which were
made available on CD-ROM by Ludwig; specifically, the fact that these CD-ROMS
have helped bring the computer virus into many businesses and households
as part of &quot;anti-virus test material&quot;, despite the fact that
such materials are unsuitable for testing [14]. While the article does
point out that many see the virus writing books as incitement to digital
vandalism, it does also state Ludwig has elevated the computer virus from
the digital equivalent of a can of spray paint to an object of almost lifelike
behaviour. The article states he &quot;transformed a tool of vandals into
a field of scientific study&quot;, although we would argue he has in fact
given virus writers a sense of legitimacy as they carry out their own brand
of unscientific &quot;research&quot;. The article concludes with this offering:
&quot;For executable DOS virus code on disk, send a check for $US50 (payable
to Virtual Life) to xxxxxxxx&quot; (Address deleted). </P>

<P>The sale of viruses is but one of the ways in which the entire &quot;virus
writing underground&quot; has become a more accepted &quot;above ground&quot;
community (one might argue that virus writing has always gone on above
ground - but that is a topic for another paper.). The &quot;Webification&quot;
of vX sites has essentially removed the &quot;I'll show you mine if you'll
show me yours&quot; attitude to virus collections and exchange. Infectious
code is now just a point and click away. While there is deliberate flippancy
here, there is an important point to be made. By allowing viruses to be
made readily available via the WWW, we as a society have demystified them;
some would say we have even legitimized them. Of course, it can be argued
that to disallow such &quot;information&quot; to be distributed would constitute
censorship. This, too, is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have
observed that exposure of the computing community to Web sites which contain
many thousands of viruses, all available for download, tends to contribute
to the desensitization of the population on the inherent dangers involved.
Virus distribution is much more acceptable now than it was even two or
three years ago. </P>

<P>Another development brought by the Internet is the somewhat curious
group alt.comp.virus [15]. Here, a bizarre collection of industry experts,
virus writers, and users gather to debate the latest viruses and their
countermeasures. The group, which was allegedly formed to overcome the
&quot;censorship&quot; of the more restrained virus-L (comp.virus) was
initially utilized by those who wanted to distribute or exchange virus
code. However, of late it has become significantly more balanced, and even
has its own FAQ, credited with appropriate thanks to Dr Alan Solomon, Vesselin
Bontchev, Rob Slade and other &quot;good guys&quot;. The newsgroup has
by its evolution encouraged people who do not approve of virus writing
and/or distribution to say so in a public forum. However, individual differences
combined with the international nature of the Internet have continued to
work together to highlight one real stumbling block to agreeing on what
constitutes &quot;responsible behaviour&quot;. The interactive nature of
the group is an excellent opportunity for rational positions regarding
the unethical nature of virus writing and distribution to be presented,
and for this reason, should be encouraged. Such interactions can only lead
to eventual understanding on the part of those still forming their own
value and belief systems, and may encourage others to think their positions
through more carefully. Notwithstanding, in August of 1996, there could
be counted a number of posts which contained either a plea for virus sites,
URLs to virus sites or uuencoded virus code, both in binary and source
formats. Once again, the desensitization continues. Virus writing is very
definitely becoming more mainstream. Perhaps this must happen before it
can be examined and determined unacceptable behaviour. Only time will tell
if this is the case. </P>

<P>In many ways, the mainstreaming of virus writing was made more clear
during the furor regarding the &quot;discovery&quot; of the Boza virus.
The following quote is taken from an interview with the alleged author
of the virus [16], and provides interesting food for thought: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;Bizatch [Boza] was completed in late November last year. We
went into beta testing in early December, which basically meant handing
it over to people we knew who were running odd configurations of Windows
95. Testing was completed in mid-December and I fixed a number of bugs
- we found that it killed certain 'new' Windows 95 executables...&quot;</I></P>
</UL>

<P>The introduction of formal Beta test cycles for viruses should be cause
for anyone who believes that we are winning the fight against computer
viruses to carefully reconsider their position. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to Top</A></P>

<P><A NAME="NEWAGE"></A></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE=+1>Who is the New Age Virus Writer?</FONT></H4>

<UL>
<P><I>&quot;Our cultural motifs, our educational system, our communications
media had failed this man. What the society permitted to trickle through
was mainly pretense and confusion. It never taught him how to distinguish
real science from cheap imitation. He knew nothing about how science works&quot;.</I></P>
</UL>

<P>This quote from <I>The Demon Haunted World</I> [17] exemplifies our
observation of the media and in some cases, the international educational
system's approach to computer viruses. While it was written by Carl Sagan
to illustrate the ways in which many New Age tenets or premises are actually
pseudoscience embraced by those who had not been exposed to real science,
it applies in no small portion to our observations of virus writers and
more importantly to those who have a good deal of influence on potential
virus writers. It is our belief that many of those who contribute to virus
writing via media representation, arguments of &quot;free speech&quot;,
actions based in large part on some type of situational ethics, and calls
for university &quot;research&quot;, do so largely because they are unfamiliar
with the technical scientific information related to viruses [18]. They
choose instead to follow whatever the current trends are, be they vX BBSs,
&quot;research&quot; for the most politically naughty virus, or acceptance
of acts which may put them or their company at significant risk of data
loss because it is easier to do these things than to examine and accept
the facts about viruses. For this reason we have called our next group
of virus writers &quot;The New Age Virus Writers&quot;. </P>

<P>Given the sorts of influences briefly discussed above, the appearance
of yet another new type of virus writer is not wholly unexpected. The New
Age Virus Writer seems to have two incarnations. The first is the most
familiar and is the type we will discuss in this section. This type is
the product of boredom, curiosity, mixed messages and technological glut.
We will consider viruses, methods and possible motivations. The second
observable type of New Age Virus Writer will then be examined in the next
section. </P>

<P>As the writers of many of the new viruses are not well known, we are
forced to draw conclusions in some part from their creations. Perhaps one
of the best examples of the work of the New Age Virus Writer is Zhengxi,
an extremely complex virus analyzed in Virus Bulletin in early 1996 [19].
This analysis states: </P>

<P><I>&quot;At 7K long, it [Zhengxi] is one of the most involved [viruses]
I have ever seen. It is a sort of 'all-in-one' virus, which infects EXE
and OBJ files, and attaches infected COM droppers to ZIP, and RAR archives
(both static and self-extracting). Its very complex polymorphism resembles
that of SMEG, but has loops often exceeding 2K in length, concealed by
vast quantities of junk subroutines, and Int 21h and CP/M calls. </I></P>

<P><I>Zhengxi infects EXE files either by appending its code to the end
of the file in the standard manner, or by looking through the file for
C or Pascal subroutines and modifying these to execute the virus (as Lucretia).
The OBJ infection technique is similar to that of Shifter [see VB March
1995, p.11], and that of archive modification was first seen in Dementia
[see VB November 1995, p.12].&quot;</I> </P>

<P>Even without specialist assembly language knowledge, it is easy to see
that Zhengxi is more of a programming exercise than a virus designed to
spread. Its author must have known that the features which he was adding
were just a display of skill. Clearly, it is not the work of a child, but
of a programmer who could earn real money writing real programs in the
real world. This is the world of the New Age Virus Writer. </P>

<P>As we have seen above, this sort of virus writer can be demonstrably
more sophisticated. Consider also the WordMacro/Concept [20] virus, currently
one of the most widespread viruses in existence according to some sources
[21]. The source code for this virus demonstrates the use of the Hungarian
naming convention; a set of detailed guidelines for naming routines and
variables. While it is used within the C programming language, especially
in Microsoft Windows programming, few virus writers we spoke with were
aware of it. [Note: according to Code Complete , <I>&quot;the term &quot;Hungarian&quot;
refers both to the fact that the names that follow the convention look
like words in a foreign language and to the fact that the creator of the
convention, Charles Simonyi, is originally from Hungary.&quot;</I>[22]
] </P>

<P>The New Age Virus Writer may be motivated by a desire such as some consider
apparent in WordMacro/Concept: to force applications designers to act in
a certain manner. He may be trying to prove their point in the only way
they feel the applications designers will understand. He may be motivated
by a desire to use viruses in what he thinks is a &quot;good&quot; way,
to help his company or department gather certain information in what he
hopes will be an unobtrusive manner [23]. </P>

<P>The New Age Virus Writer worships at the altar of technology, and uses
other's lack of understanding of the issues and their implication as a
vehicle to advance his own particular form of magic. Consider this implementation
of certain techniques: WordMacro/Spoof [24], which creates its own custom
dialogue box for Tools Macro, hiding the presence of its own installed
macros. According to the author of this virus, the only copy he has distributed
was sent directly to me; thus, the virus has not been distributed to any
other researchers, in the hope of containing the technology. (This is a
recognized and approved course of action within the anti-virus industry
when a researcher strongly believes he or she has the only sample in existence
of a particular virus.) In the world of the New Age Virus Writer, there
is access to powerful computing equipment. Unlike the early days, even
as recently as 2-3 years ago when the our initial study was begun, the
viruses seem to indicate there is now access to various operating systems,
applications, and programming tools. </P>

<P>You won't usually find the virus writers' names spattered all over their
creations, or bandied about the Internet; you will rarely find their creations
first on virus exchange or virus WWW sites. Observation shows these individuals
tend to be a bit older and more cautious than the Next Generation Virus
Writer. They do not share &quot;accomplishments&quot; with peers, perhaps
because they are old enough to be held responsible for their negligence
in releasing viruses. </P>

<P>This type of virus writer is not likely to &quot;age out&quot; for two
reasons. One, he is already an adult, and two, the concept of &quot;aging
out&quot; applies to behaviours which are perceived as morally unacceptable
by the society and which are left behind during the natural course of individual
ethical progression . As we have just shown, while virus writing may in
reality be an unacceptable activity, the perception of it fostered by the
media, some adults, some Universities and some ISPs combine with the &quot;Cult
of the Internet&quot; to produce some very mixed messages. </P>

<P><A NAME="STOPPING"></A></P>

<H3>Stopping the New Age Virus Writer</H3>

<P>We have speculated in the above that the New Age Virus Writer is somewhat
older, employed and does not make his identity known. Given this, how can
we go about the job of stopping him? The suggestions given below are made
to facilitate a discussion on what may or may not be acceptable. We do
not in any way advocate government censorship or control of information:
however, we feel that responsibility must come along with freedom and for
this reason do not find public virus distribution acceptable. With this
in mind, we have gathered various perspectives on controlling the problems
addressed herein. </P>

<P>While laws to punish those who are caught intentionally spreading computer
viruses to the unknowing and unwilling are one tool which can be used to
discourage this sort of negligent and criminal behaviour, the nature of
virus writing and distribution highlights the need for additional, more
effective tools. The main tool we have at our disposal is that of communication.
We must attempt to change the attitude of as many as possible regarding
computer viruses. Obviously, this is the &quot;big picture&quot; approach.
Without cooperation from educators, legal policy makers, judiciary, parents,
and the media, there is little hope that the virus writing phenomenon will
subside. It will continue to shift, becoming more and less, less and more
acceptable to engage in the activity. </P>

<P>To discourage these sorts of behaviours, people may wish to consider
voicing their displeasure publicly. This could include informing their
Internet service providers (who lend viruses an air of credibility by allowing
them to be distributed) that they consider this irresponsible and unacceptable.
This could also be made evident in several other ways: it may take the
form of a vendor disallowing distribution of their shareware from sites
which openly allow virus distribution (such an approach has been attempted
by Frisk Software) or it may involve individual or corporate users discontinuing
the use of service from providers which allow users to make viruses available.
Both of these suggestions have been made publicly by members of the anti-virus
community, but we have no way of knowing the actual result. It has been
suggested that it may prove effective to write letters voicing concern
to the appropriate persons at various service providers, or writing letters
thanking those who act responsibly. Universities, which in some cases are
privately funded, may be open to suggestions from supporters. Publicly
funded universities have been known to investigate irresponsible behaviours
of other types once alerted; some people have tried informing universities
which are known to have viruses on their sites. However, according to one
university site which wishes to go unnamed, the person reporting the files
as &quot;unacceptable&quot; first ftp-ed the entire virus collection before
making his report. This obviously sends a real mixed message, and should
be avoided. </P>

<P>Destructive behaviours should not be encouraged under the guise of &quot;science&quot;:
the problem with viruses we find in many universities seems to be a lack
of understanding on the part of most professors of the issues involved.
Taking an active role in the educational process at the university level,
and clearly voicing a concern over ethically questionable methods may help
avoid placing the university at risk from both a technical and PR standpoint.
Vendors and users may wish to consider advising testers who may be testing
anti-virus products using questionable methods which are linked to virus
production or legitimization that such methods are unacceptable. It could
prove effective to disallow advertising in magazines which utilize such
methods, or to write letters to the editors and publishers, stating displeasure
with the situation. Making a public issue out of irresponsible behaviours
has sometimes worked to discourage the behaviours. However, this kind of
action can have the opposite effect. Therefore, this should be considered
a matter of individual discretion and should not be undertaken lightly
without full regard for possible ramifications. Finally, we as a society
must be willing to relay the message of responsible computing to our children,
who may be encouraged and influenced by the media and Internet culture.
We recognize this is a long term approach to the problem; there are no
immediate solutions. </P>

<P>There are, however, things you can do now to lessen the impact of the
second type of New Age Virus Writer, which we will now discuss. This type
of virus writer has all the skills and motivations mentioned so far in
this paper, with the additional contributory factors of office politics
and incorrect organizational security policies. This type of virus writer
may be working for you. </P>

<P>One action you can take now is to examine your own company. Do you have
IT staff , locally or regionally, who can be found &quot;playing around&quot;
with viruses? As we have shown, the secrecy and contraband image of viruses
is gone. The viruses are easy to obtain now and there is much less stigma
attached to both obtaining them and &quot;learning&quot;. Macro viruses,
written in well-documented, easier to comprehend languages such as Visual
Basic for Applications (VBA) are all too easy to obtain, to understand
and to modify or write. A well-intentioned IT Manager can inadvertently
modify an existing Macro virus while attempting to see what it does. Adding
a REM comment could create a new variant. If viruses are seen as something
which can be toyed with at leisure (many e-mail messages are received by
some anti-virus vendors every week which contain the dreaded line &quot;I've
played with the virus a bit and found...&quot;) there is always the danger
that that exploration might be taken, intentionally or unintentionally,
too far. Regardless of the intent, the impact on a company can be devastating.
</P>

<P>When you have a virus outbreak, it is imperative to find out where the
virus came from. Of course, this should be done not in a finger pointing
or blaming manner, but as a routine part of your security processes [25].
It should be determined that viral infections are not the result of, for
instance, in-house Web cruising of virus distribution Internet sites. Your
security policies should outline acceptable practice with those viruses
which are discovered, and those practices should exclude &quot;experimentation&quot;
which can lead to accidental modification. This should apply whether the
viruses are .COM and .EXE infectors, Macro viruses, or any other sort of
virus. Every so often, we get reports of a new virus in the wild from a
customer who has experienced a small outbreak of a &quot;Zoo&quot; virus.
Often, these viruses are buggy, and stand little or no chance of being
globally successful; they have been introduced to the company by an employee
who was testing anti-virus software, or &quot;experimenting&quot;. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONCLUSION"></A></P>

<H4><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></H4>

<P>In this paper, we have continued the work started in TGVW, following
the ethical development of four virus writers. As predicted in the earlier
work, those who have continued a normal ethical development have aged out
of virus writing. This may well continue to be the only effective way that
many of the current virus writers will stop. </P>

<P>However, there are two disturbing trends developing within the virus
writing community, and the computing industry in general. First, there
are virus writers who seem to be motivated by different reasons than the
old &quot;virus underground&quot;. We believe that some of these virus
writers are older and more skilled than before. Viruses like Zhengxi and
Concept point to an advanced knowledge of programming techniques; the reasons
for the development of attacks may well be changing. Coupled with this
is the steady legitimization of virus writing, making it &quot;less wrong&quot;
in the eyes of the general public. This will act to prevent those involved
from &quot;aging out&quot; even if they follow a normal ethical development,
and is cause for significant concern to those in the anti-virus industry
and all those concerned about data security. This legitimization and desensitization
contributes to the writing or modification of viruses in companies as well
as by the classic &quot;Virus Writer&quot;. Whether we like it or not,
our own actions and words communicate to the next generation what is acceptable
socially, ethically, and legally and what is not. By our actions, or lack
thereof, today, we ourselves are creating the virus writers of tomorrow
