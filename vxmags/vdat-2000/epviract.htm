<P><I><B>Abstract:</B> This paper categorizes different types of virus
activation routines which are found in existing viruses and also discusses
what triggers these activation routines. Common viruses are used as examples
where possible. This paper also covers why it is important to know what
a virus exactly does if you are infected by one. Some horror stories of
the worst possible activation routine in a virus are also included. The
scope of this paper is limited to PC compatible machines.</I> </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>General public's idea of a computer virus is usually something like
&quot;It's a program that destroys data&quot;. Strictly, this is not true,
for a virus doesn't have to destroy anything in order to be a virus. In
fact, <B>most </B>of the known viruses do not format hard drives or overwrite
files - or do anything at all in addition to spreading. </P>

<P>All anti-virus support persons know that a lot of the people calling
for support are asking &quot;Your program said I have this virus. What
does it do?&quot;, and the typical answer is: &quot;Nothing. It just replicates&quot;.
</P>

<P>People often find this surprising, because the destructive or spectacular
viruses - naturally - get more publicity than the boring ones which have
nothing special about them. Still, roughly half of the known viruses have
no activation routines at all. Perhaps the authors of these viruses wanted
to make the virus smaller by omitting such routines, or perhaps they reasoned
that any activation at all is just going to make the virus discovered earlier.
Or perhaps they just didn't have the imagination to think up one. </P>

<P><B>Common viruses and activation routines</B> </P>

<P>When we look at some of the most common viruses worldwide, we see that
most of them have no visible activation feature at all: </P>

<UL>
<LI>AntiCMOS.A - has an activation routine, which is never executed </LI>

<LI>AntiEXE - has an activation routine, which is practically never executed
</LI>

<LI>DIR_II.A - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Form.A - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Tai-Pan.438 - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Junkie - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Stoned.Empire.Monkey.B - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Stoned.Standard.A - has an activation routine, which is executed very
seldom </LI>

<LI>Stoned.No_INT.A - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>Stealth_Boot.B - no activation routine </LI>

<LI>WordMacro/Concept - no activation routine </LI>
</UL>

<P>These viruses alone cover currently probably two thirds of all the virus
infections worldwide. However, there are viruses with activation features
among the most common viruses as well: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Kampana.A - overwrites part of the hard drive after 400 boots </LI>

<LI>Green_Caterpillar.1575 - draws a Caterpillar on screen after 60 days
</LI>
</UL>

<I>Figure 1: Activation routine of Green_Caterpillar.1575</I> </P></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>Michelangelo - overwrites part of the hard drive on every 6th of March
</LI>

<LI>Cascade.1701.A - drops letters to the bottom of the screen </LI>

<LI>V-Sign - draws an ASCII graphics of a large V after every 64 boots
</LI>

<LI>Tequila - draws a fractal by random </LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="tequila.gif" HEIGHT=304 WIDTH=561><BR>

<H2>Classification</H2>

<P>There are no formal classifications rules for different activation routines
in viruses. However, we can categorize the routines from known viruses
to the following groups: </P>

<P><B>Data destruction</B> </P>

<P>Destructive activation routines can furthermore be grouped to immediate
and gradual. </P>

<P>Examples of immediate destruction include viruses like Michelangelo,
Kampana and Natas, which simply overwrite part of the hard drive with a
low-level BIOS function. Other viruses with immediate destructive routines
will delete or overwrite files instead of overwriting physical sectors.
</P>

<P>Gradual destruction is done by viruses such as Ripper or Nomenklatura,
which slowly corrupt the data on the hard drive. This is also sometimes
called data-diddling. Such corruption is likely to go unnoticed until the
corrupted data has been backed up several times. This makes recovering
considerably more difficult, and in most cases significant amounts of data
is lost for good. </P>

<P>Thankfully, destructive activation routines quite often fail to work
due programming errors. It seems that the virus authors are reluctant to
test these routines on their own machines. </P>

<P>It is also worth noticing that there are very few destructive viruses
on the Macintosh side. This is possibly a result of the different user
cultures between users of PC and Mac machines. </P>

<P><B>Sounds, tunes, speech</B> </P>

<P>There are several viruses which activate by playing tunes through PC
speaker. Probably the most common examples are the different Yankee_Doodle
variants which activate by playing the Yankee Doodle tune at different
times of day. Other viruses just produce beeps and zaps occasionally. There
are also some viruses which try to speak - an example of this is the Dreamer
virus, which tries to say &quot;Hitler!&quot; through the PC speaker. There
exists also viruses which try to utilize a sound card if one is found from
the infected PC. </P>

<P><B>Animations</B> </P>

<P>Viruses which activate with an animation can be further grouped to text-mode
and graphical animations. Examples of text-mode animations are the Cascade.1701.A
virus, which will drop the characters on-screen to the bottom of the screen
or the Walker virus, which will produce a walking man to the screen. Another
example is the Vienna.Bua AKA Big Caibua virus, which gathered media attention
by producing a text-mode animation of an ejaculating penis on-screen while
deleting data on the hard drive. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="walker.gif" HEIGHT=406 WIDTH=726><BR>
<I>Figure 3: Activation routine of the Walker virus</I> </P></CENTER>

<P>Graphical activation routines are somewhat rarer, but such are found
in viruses like Den_Zuk, which produces a logo on-screen, or the HH&amp;H
virus, which shows a quite interesting 3D animation of a bouncing ball
build out of small dots. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="denzuk.gif" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=320><BR>
<I>Figure 4: Activation routine of the Den_Zuko virus</I> </P></CENTER>

<P><B>Messages</B> </P>

<P>Viruses which display messages on-screen, include Stoned.Standard.A,
which occasionally displays &quot;Your PC is now Stoned!&quot; if the machine
is booted from a floppy. Another common virus which has a message to display
is the Parity_Boot.B virus, which activates by displaying &quot;PARITY
CHECK&quot;. </P>

<P>A more interesting display is produced by the Rescue virus, which shows
a screen full of nonsense messages. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="rescue.gif" HEIGHT=308 WIDTH=647><BR>
<I>Figure 5: On-screen message shown by the Rescue virus</I> </P></CENTER>

<P><B>Interactive activations</B> </P>

<P>Some viruses stop the PC and demand the user of the PC to do something.
For example, the Joshi virus will stop the machine on January 5th and demand
the user to type &quot;Happy Birthday Joshi&quot; before the machine continues
working, and the Casino virus, which will put the user to gamble in a Jackpot
game with the stakes being the contents of his hard drive. </P>

<P>Some viruses will demand more effort from the user. The YAM.Math virus
will occasionally stop the machine when a program is run and display simple
addition or subtraction questions. Execution of the program is denied unless
the correct answer is given by the user. </P>

<P>Another similar virus called Peter_II displays the following message:
</P>

<PRE>

Good morning,EVERYbody,I am PETER II

Do not turn off the power, or you will lost all of the data in Hardisk!!!

WAIT for 1 MINUTES,please...

</PRE>

<P>After this, the virus encrypts the whole hard drive. After that, it
continues by displaying the following questionnaire: </P>

<PRE>

        Ok.If you give the right answer to the following questions,

        I will save your HD:

        A. Who has sung the song called &quot;I`ll be there&quot; ?

           1.Mariah Carey  2.The Escape Club  3.The Jackson five  4.All  (1-4):

        B. What is Phil Collins ?

           1.A singer  2.A drummer  3.A producer  4.Above all(1-4):

        C. Who has the MOST TOP 10 singles in 1980`s ?

           1.Michael Jackson  2.Phil Collins (featuring Genesis)

           3.Madonna  4.Whitney Houston(1-4):

</PRE>

<P>If the user gives correct answers to every question, the virus decrypts
the hard disk and displays the following message: </P>

<PRE>

        CONGRATULATIONS !!! YOU successfully pass the quiz!

        AND NOW RECOVERING YOUR HARDISK ......

</PRE>

<P>The user can then continue using the computer normally. However, if
incorrect answers are given, the virus will not decrypt the hard disk.
Instead, it will just display the following message: </P>

<PRE>

        Sorry!Go to Hell.Clousy man!

</PRE>

<P>Correct answers to the questions are left as an exercise to the reader.
</P>

<P>Finally, some viruses invite the user to play a game on the PC. An example
of this is the Playgame virus, which displays a simple race game. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="playgame.gif" HEIGHT=406 WIDTH=726><BR>
<I>Figure 6: Playfield displayed by the Playgame virus</I> </P></CENTER>

<P><B>Fake hardware failures</B> </P>

<P>Some viruses try to simulate a hardware failure. For example, the Azusa
virus disables the serial and parallel ports of the machine and Parity_Boot
makes it appear as if the machine has faulty memory chips. </P>

<P>In the worst case, user replaces components of his system before he
realizes that there is physically nothing wrong in the machine. </P>

<P><B>Practical jokes</B> </P>

<P>Several viruses play practical jokes with the user. The Jerusalem.Fu_Manchu
virus observes what the user is typing, and inserts comments when keywords
such as 'Thatcher', 'Reagan' or 'Waldheim' are entered. </P>

<P>The Armagedon virus from Greece checks if a modem is connected to the
machine and tries to call out to the local time service when the time is
between 5am and 6am. The Fone.688 does a similar thing, except that it
calls to X-rated 1-900 phone services in the USA. </P>

<P>Haifa virus inserts two text lines in the middle of DOC files when they
are accessed: </P>

<PRE>

OOPS!  Hope I didn't ruin anything!!!

Well, nobody reads those stupied DOCS anyway!

</PRE>

<P>Similarly, the WordMacro/Nuclear virus adds comments against French
nuclear testing in Pacific to the end of documents when they are printed
or faxed from Microsoft Word. </P>

<P><B>Denial of service</B> </P>

<P>Some viruses just try to make the machine unusable. Viruses which overwrite
hard drives obviously do this, but good backups provide a fast way to recover
from them. Then there are viruses like Monica, which sets the BIOS boot-up
password function on (if the BIOS supports this) and sets the password
to 'monica'. As there is no way for the user to guess the password, the
machine is effectively rendered unusable until CMOS battery is disconnected.
In future we will see Flash BIOS -aware viruses, which will cause even
more difficult problems. </P>

<H2>Triggers</H2>

<P>There are several different trigger events, which viruses use to decide
when to activate. These include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Date or time </LI>

<LI>Generation counter of the virus </LI>

<LI>Number of keypresses on the keyboard </LI>

<LI>Amount of free space on the hard drive </LI>

<LI>Amount of minutes the machine has been idle </LI>

<LI>Name of an executed program </LI>
</UL>

<P>Basically any event it the PC can be used as a trigger by a virus. </P>

<H2>Why it is important to know what a virus does</H2>

<P>When you have a real infection in your hands, you probably want to know
what the virus in question does. Actually, this information can be crucial,
especially in the case of viruses which do gradual corruption. </P>

<P>A virus like One_Half also demonstrates the importance of knowing what
a virus does before starting to disinfect it: One_Half is a full stealth
virus, which gradually encrypts the contents of the hard drive. The encryption
key and counter is kept inside the virus body in the boot sector. If One_Half
is removed by overwriting the virus code in the boot sector with a clean
one, the components required to decrypt the drive are lost, and the encryption
will not be hidden anymore by the stealth routines of the virus. In effect,
data on the hard drive is lost due to disinfecting the virus. </P>

<H2>Information sources</H2>

<P>It would be great to have a single source of information which would
describe every computer virus, complete with it's propagation methods and
activation routines. Unfortunately, no such reference exists, and will
never exist. There are just too many viruses out there and new ones are
created too fast. </P>

<P>Today, when several new viruses are found every day, virus experts have
limited time to spend with analyzing any single virus. Virus analysis systems
are automated as much as possible, and a virus typically only gets a cursory
look - which is usually enough to add detection, identification and disinfection.
Such analysis will not reveal any special features the virus may contain.
For this reason, no anti-virus vendor can provide a complete reference
guide for all viruses their product detects. </P>

<P>There are, however, some sources which are useful. These sources typically
cover only the most common or otherwise special viruses, but this is usually
enough. </P>

<P>These sources include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The virus description database of F-PROT Professional antivirus package.
Do note that this is not the same as in the shareware version of F-PROT.
The emphasis of descriptions are on viruses which are known to be in the
wild. </LI>

<LI>Virus description service at Data Fellows Ltd's Internet World-Wide
Web server at http://www.datafellows.com/. This database is based on the
same information as in F-PROT Professional antivirus program, but it is
constantly updated, and features the possibility to do free searches and
browse through the latest updates. This is a free service, which is currently
serving several hundreds of description requests every day. </LI>

<LI>AVP Virus Encyclopedia. This Russian freeware DOS hypertext program
has probably the largest single set of descriptions; there are several
thousand viruses described here. Some of the descriptions even include
a demo of the actual activation routine. The only problem with AVPVE is
that at times the language is a bit difficult to understand - English with
Russian accent. </LI>

<LI>CAROBase is a joint effort by the Computer Antivirus Researcher's Organization
to gather technical descriptions of viruses. It currently contains only
about 120 descriptions, but the detail and accuracy of those are excellent.
</LI>

<LI>VTC Computer Virus Catalog is already getting outdated, but it still
contains excellent descriptions of over 200 PC viruses, and also covers
other platforms, such as Amiga, Atari or Unix. </LI>
</UL>

<P>There are other sources available as well. The popular VSUM Virus Summary
can not be strongly recommended due the several errors it contains, but
it can be useful as a cross-reference tool when trying to locate a virus
which is known by several alias names. </P>

<P>Antivirus programs such as McAfee SCAN, Thunderbyte Antivirus or Dr.
Solomon's Antivirus Toolkit do contain brief descriptions, but these are
all based on a few basic attributes for each virus, so they don't have
details on activation routines. S&amp;S International has also published
a book called Virus Encyclopaedia, which has more detailed information.
</P>

<H2>Future</H2>

<P><B>Worst possible activation routine</B> </P>

<P>What would be the worst possible activation routine that could exist
in a virus? Obviously it is not a virus which would just destroy data -
incidents like that are relatively unimportant if good backup practices
are kept, and gradually corrupting viruses can be found with good integrity
checking. But how about a virus which would breach the security and privacy
of your system? </P>

<P>The rising popularity of the Internet does indeed bring new risks. Considering
the widespread use of the Internet and TCP/IP connections for normal PC
workstations, and the amount of Winsock installations in use, several scary
visions can be thought of. How about a virus which would open a NNTP connection
from your machine and spam every newsgroup in the Usenet news hierarchy,
masquerading as you? Or send rude e-mail messages to all addresses found
from your e-mail package's alias database. In some e-mail systems, a virus
could even use the authentication features to positively identify that
the sender is actually you. </P>

<P>Even worse, how about a virus which would wait until a machine with
a Winsock connection has been idle for some hours, open a ftp connection
to some large public ftp server which has an open area for incoming files
and uploads all DOC, XLS and DBF files found from your hard drive - or
your network? If the virus were widespread, Internet surfers would make
interesting discoveries while going through the confidential files of hundreds
or thousands of unsuspecting users. </P>

<P>It's difficult to think of a worse activation routine for a virus. Unfortunately,
we will probably see something like this in the future. </P>

<H2>Conclusions</H2>

<P>There is a wide variety of activation routines found in the current
viruses. After all, only the imagination is the limit. There are some scary
possibilities which future viruses will probably use in their activation
routines to make the life of a computer user miserable. </P>

<P>It's still good to keep in mind that although flashy viruses get all
the media attention, most viruses do nothing but replicate.
