<p><b><font color="#004080"> Tell us something about you (country, age, whatever 
  else,.. :) </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well im from the UK, 23 years old and male. I currently code Macro/VBS viruses/worms. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Why did you choose your handle and has it a special 
  meaning? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Its from a song "I Am The Walrus" by the Beatles. One of my favourite songs. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> When was your first contact with a computer? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> My first computer was a Spectrum 128k. I learned Basic from books. I diddnt 
    get a PC till I was 16. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What was your first contact with the genre 'virus'? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I learned about the existence of computer viruses from magazines and newspapers 
    etc. Whether they know it or not they promote viruses. They make them seem 
    mystical, like living creatures. I strived to learn as much as I could about 
    how they worked. I read every book and source code I could get my hands on. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How long have you been in the VX scene? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> About a year I think. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How did you make your way in the VX Scene ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> From reading zines and source code I realized that a "scene" existed where 
    people of this nature met. I mailed a few people first asking advice on problems 
    I was having etc. I also discovered that these ppl also met in chatrooms. 
    So I set up mIRC and joined the channels. I kept to myself at first to learn 
    the ropes etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How do you see the virus scene? Past, present and 
  future... </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The scene now can be very good sometimes. It is very good for sharing ideas, 
    source code, and generally chatting to like minded people. However it can 
    also be very bad. There seems to be a lot of bitchiness at times and a hostility 
    to people who just want to learn. Some people seem to be power orientated 
    and abuse this. Also there seems to be certain people who are generally untrusted 
    by many due to them having AV, legal links. This is not good and promotes 
    paranoia. Of the past I cant comment, although from texts ive read it seems 
    that more comradery was present. Of the future we can only hope things change 
    for the better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which programming languages do you know? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> VBA, VBScript and a little C++. Ive also dabbled in mIRC Script on some 
    of my viruses/worms. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How many viruses have you coded ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Eleven </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How do you spread your viruses? :o) </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I dont..... honest </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Are any of you viruses in the wild? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Dont know, I dont think so. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> How do you name your viruses? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Just on how im feeling or perhaps on the viruse characteristics. Sometimes 
    naming them can be the hardest part. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you have any new ideas for viruses you want to 
  write in the near future? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Id like to create a mailing virus. Not a mass mailing one like melissa but 
    one that attaches itself to mails as you send them. Therefore not creating 
    mail traffic. Also id like to venture into html virus coding and in the future 
    win32 asm. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which was your best virus you ever coded til yet? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Best, I think is Furio. It does not infect the Normal Template at all and 
    does not rely on Auto Macros to infect documents. It also has a nice payload 
    (see below) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which viruses do you think are the viruses of the 
  next generation ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I definatly think that HLL viruses will be the most significant ones in 
    the future. This is the current trend. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What did you think about destructive payloads in 
  viruses ? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I dont agree with destructive payloads. I think they are counter productive. 
    Just trying to remove a virus from your system can be destructive in itself. 
    However I dont frown on people who use destructive payloads, thats their choice. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which payloads did you try in your viruses? Any special 
  one? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> For a description of my first (Fools Gold) see <a href="http://www.cai.com/virusinfo/encyclopedia/descriptions/foola.htm">http://www.cai.com/virusinfo/encyclopedia/descriptions/foola.htm</a>. 
    Ive also used IRC messaging (Help), Riddles that require answering before 
    word can be used again (Riddler), Changing homepage to my page (SuperNova), 
    random word swapping (WordBug), CD tray open/close (Jackal). I especially 
    like my newest (Furio). It Opens Notepad and types a message it also displays 
    a user form. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What is your oppinion about virus construction kits? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> To code them is very good. To learn the basics from them is ok. To use them 
    to produce your own viruses and then promote/spread them as your own is very 
    lame. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What is your favourite virus/virus generator/poly 
  engine? </font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> My favorite virus is CIH without a doubt. It spread so well, had revolutionary 
    ideas, was fairly small i believe and contained relativley few bugs. I am 
    also an admirer of the Melissa virus/worm, the original Class virus and the 
    Happy worm. </p>
  <p> My favorite Virus Generators are the ones by VicodinES (<a href="creatrs1.htm#CPCK">CPCK</a> 
    and <a href="creatrs2.htm#VMPCK">VMPCK</a>). They are coded well, work properly 
    (not like some other kits) and are visually great. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which guys do you respect most in the virus scene? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Currently Zulu, he seems to be able to produce revolutionary codes consistantly. 
    Im also a fan of Jackie. Also VicodinES and the usuals like Dark Avenger, 
    Dark Angel, Priest etc </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Which VX groups do you like best? and why? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well <a href="groups1.htm#29A">29a</a>, <a href="groups2.htm#META">Metaphase</a> 
    because theyve got some history and yet are still producing. From the past 
    <a href="groups2.htm#PS">Phalcon/Skism</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What were/are the best virus magazine in your oppinion? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Well im a big fan of VDAT and was even before I new how to code a virus. 
    Also I like the <a href="ezines1.htm#LZO">Line0</a> and <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29a</a> 
    zines. In the past I also read a lot of the Phalcon/Skism zines <a href="ezines1.htm#40HEX">40Hex</a>. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Are you in any VX group? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> No. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Tell us something about your group?(general info,members,etc) 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> N/A </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What do you think about AV's (and their products)? 
  Which are best/worst? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Some people dislike AV's for various reasons however I think that they fill 
    a role in this whole thing. They need us to keep them in business and in turn 
    I think we need them. They set the standards for new viruses. They push virus 
    authors further and further into making undetectable and new viruses. For 
    the best I think AVP, it is very good at detecting and naming a virus. For 
    the worst McAfee. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> We all heard rumors about No Mercy Virus Team so 
  are they disbaned? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> eh? Dont care :-) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Besides viruses coding, what do you do in real life? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Work, Drink, and Sleep Although not enough of the latter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do your close friends, parents, girlfriend know you 
  write Virus? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Very close friends yes, girlfriend also (although she does not approve). 
    Parents and the rest no. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What music do you like? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> I like all sorts of music. I can listen to anything. My favorite type is 
    Rock and Roll cause I play it on guitar. Typically 60's music from bands like 
    The Beatles, Kinks, The Who, Rolling Stones, Small Faces. I also like modern 
    music like Oasis, Stereophonics, Primal Scream etc and even the odd dance 
    tune! </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Do you have any hobbies beside computer? </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Hobbies, not really, no special hobbies. Just interests like everyone else, 
    eg football, cars, music etc. I play the guitar. Thats a hobbie I suppose 
    :-) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> What is your best advice to a newbie in vx scene? 
  </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Id advise reading and learning yourself rather than asking everyone simple 
    questions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#004080"> Greets to other virus people and groups </font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> In no particular order. </p>
  <p> Perikles, Phage, Exe-Gency, VirusBuster, Paul Zest, Jackie, Knowdeth, Tally, 
    Roadkil, Slage Hammer,Yello, Dageshi, $MOOTHiE and anyone ive spoke to but 
    missed. </p>
