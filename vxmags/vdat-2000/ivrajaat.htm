<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080"><FONT SIZE=+3>Interview with Rajaat<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>by The Unforgiven</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P></CENTER>

<P>I found Rajaat at some .uk address while chatting on IRC. Since I at
that time had plans for releasing issue #7 and needed to fatten up it a
bit, so I asked for an interview and he agreed on doing one. While talking,
it turned out to be a very large interview, and I think it became more
of a conversation. </P>

<P>Since this interview was done, several interesting things that you should
be aware of has happend with this character. Some things written here isn't
correct anymore. Most important to be aware of is that Rajaat is a member
of a new viruswriting group known as <A HREF="groups1.htm#GEN">Genesis</A>.
Genesis aim for quality, and I'm happy to see that Rajaat is not a loner
anymore and have find a group in where he really belongs. You saw tb_bug
by <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">Rhincewind/Vlad</A> and Rajaat? Well, you've
seen nothing yet.. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">[Rajaat is now (2/98) a <A HREF="groups1.htm#29A">29A</A>
member / Cicatrix]</FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You probably have read a few of our old interview's
with a few other (fame) scene-guys, so, prepere for the same kinda questions
as for starters.. . . 'Introduce yourself to the readers. . ' </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm Rajaat, a newcomer in the virus scene and I hope to stay longer
in here than all other virus writers from the UK, like <A HREF="groups1.htm#ARCV">ARCV</A>
and Black Baron. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, we can always hope so :). Do you have
a question you would like me to ask because I don't have too much information
about you (except from what I could obtain from your viruses/engines released)?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Heh, you can always ask me why I started to write viruses or how I got
involved in writing these things.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, ok. Let's take the normal questions as
for now, and then I might know you better after a while :). So, why did
you start write these kinda programs?</FONT></B> </P>

<UL>
<P>Eh, as long as the feds don't get to know me better! HAHAHA! The reason
I write these viruses is simply I got nothing better to do. After some
incident I got kicked out of college and hanging out on the streets sucks,
so I better stick to programming. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any specific reason to you were kicked out
from school? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yea... :) It had to do with some account stealing (from other students)
and releasing a virus in their directory (and infected their programming
projects), that the teachers had to check (at home, eventually). HAHA These
stupid goofs got fucked over so they couldn't judge us.. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you got caught in the first place?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I was one of the few assembler programmers there and ofcourse my programs
weren't infected :) And they found a list with hacked passwords in my drawer.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ah, okay, I see. . You said you had nothing
better to do than to write viruses but why didn't you instead start to
program something useful. Then people would appreciate your programs instead
of being scared of them? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I can't think of anything useful, most utilities are being written already.
And, like you, there are people that like viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">I don't like viruses, what makes you think
that? ;) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Why would you otherwise write Insane Reality? Or is it something you
just have to? I just like to program them, it's a challenge. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Now, you're the one asking questions :). So,
let's continue. . . From where did you got your handle &quot;Rajaat&quot;
? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If people know Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (a role playing game) they
also might know the Dark Sun world. Rajaat is the one that invented sorcery
there and he is the creator of the Champions, like Andropinis. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Oh, I see. Has AD&amp;D or role-playing in
general influent you in any way when it comes to writing viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I just use the names to give my children (the viruses) a name, nothing
more and nothing less. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Isn't it kinda pervert to refer your viruses
as your children? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, see it like this: I created them, I'm the father. I use Turbo Assembler
and you can consider it the mother, ah, I don't know, but I feel like I
am the father of them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, I've heared stories about the viruswriters
refering their computer to be their girlfriend and the virus is a result
of love between the writer and the computer :). But that is another story,
so is this also your motivation to write viruses, to create life and alternative
lifeforms? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I just do it out of boredom. I can't think of any useful programs
to write and writing viruses may bring fame to me, and the UK needs a boost
I think. It has been quite silent in here for a time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hmm, think you already said that :). Yea, aren't
you btw afraid to get caught by Dr.Solly and Scotland Yard computer-crime
division or so? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Of course I am, but that will not stop me. I am hard to trace, because
I don't be on #virus but a more general channel and not even using the
name Rajaat. Furthermore the viruses I spread on school weren't made by
me, so that should give them a hard time to find out. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which viruses did you spread anyways? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The ones that are already very common, like Junkie and Tai-Pan. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Funny, consider both of them are swedish viruses
:). Hmmm, which kinda virus do you like (a few examples maybe) and which
virus-writers do you look up to? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Er... I don't have many examples, but I like the viruses of Qark (to
whom I send Andropinis (anonymously)) and of Priest, but apperently he
quitted virus writing. I don't have many idols, because I don't want to
influence my programming with other techniques. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Haven't you considred joining (or forming)
a virus-writing group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I wanted to join <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>, but the danger
is that the more people do know me, the more chance I have to get caught
in the end. It's better that I do contributions to various magazines using
a anonymous account. I don't care if I work alone or not. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, that seems to be a smart move. Hmmm, how
about contributing some new virus of yours to this issue as well? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sounds good. I still have some stealth bootsector virus here somewhere
on my disk. I will comment it a little more and then DCC it to you, ok?
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, send it to tuir@fotd.mcn.ru. What's your
policy about destructive viruses, and how do you define destructive viruses?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>My opinion is that a virus gets more attention if it's destructive.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">I saw a polymorphic engine by you btw (Thanks
for the greetings!), say, what kinda questions can I ask about that? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmmm.. I don't really know, it's not very polymorphic and should be
easy to crack, but it was just made to make it impossible to use a scan
string for a virus. I just used it myself once and that's it. I don't know
if there are other viruses that use it. Maybe I will write one engine for
polymorphic bootsector viruses HAHAHA! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How to detect it then, with cryptoanalyze or
something like that (or have you written detection for it yourself)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You can use cryptanalysis for it and it's also possible to trace the
decryptor, like TBAV does. It's just that they have to do something more
than usual to detect it. I think the better AV'ers will have no problem
detecting it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, stupid question of myne btw, I already
knew that :). Hmm, which engine do you like the most? Hmm, know this (also)
is a kinda stupid question to ask since it's like 25 (or so?) engines out
there and nearly none of them is released with source-codes making it exteremly
time-consuming to make a depth-in study of them all.. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I never bothered to look at them closely, indeed. The ones I liked however
are <A HREF="engine1.htm#DAME">DAME</A> (of Dark Angel), the engine in
Natas, the engine in Level_3 and <A HREF="engine2.htm#TPE">TPE 1.4</A>,
but I don't have the source code of the last mentioned. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, so, why didn't you released the source-code
to your engine? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nobody would use it, though. I think I will clean up the comments and
send it to you sometime, I don't know. RTFM seems finished to me, and continueing
it seems a waste of time to me. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, enuff about polymorphism as for now :).
How would you descibe the perfect virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A virus that takes to much time to detect (by a scanner) that it better
can be discarded from it. ;) I don't think there will be the &quot;ultimate&quot;
virus. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, polymorphism might be a step toward the
right direction, but it's still far from the final solution. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The engines of today prevent easy recognition, but they lack the protective
mechanisms that are needed to conceal the virus from debugging. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So, you think an utility that would support
stealth, advanced-polymorpism, retro-functions of any kind would be a logical
step to do? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. I don't believe in stealth techniques very much, except for bootsector
and partition record infections. File stealth is too &quot;fragile&quot;
to do. I believe in polymorphic engines than also generate polymorhic anti-trace
routines, like the Ultimute engine, but more advanced. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hm, retro-functions and polymoprism might fuck
the AV'ers and the researchers up, but for the normal user (the one's who
get struck with a virus) it won't really matter. If they notice a virus
they won't remove (or debug) it themself anyway (not in most cases that
is). Then - stealth might be better for spreading purposes because they
won't detect it in ages. . Like with Natas or a virus of that capacity.
How easy is that do detect for the average Jow-Blow? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmmm, I still don't like it. Look for example at Andropinis. It's very
easy to detect in .COM files, but there is also the MBR infection that
is stealth indeed. If I have to use stealth on files, it would probably
only hide the file size and I would not bother to write a heap of code
just to make it also full stealth. (* Full stealth = disinfection/redirection
on files as well, - ED *) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">The package you described above called &quot;Ultimute
engine&quot; which Stormbringer (read: Black Wolf) wrote, what does it
do? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Oh, I didn't knew Black Wolf = Stormbringer! It's an engine that generates
a decryptor peppered with some antidebugger tricks, but the way he did
it can't stop the people who know debugging/tracing tricks well. I have
a few ideas, but I don't know if I will make such an engine, but it's on
my &quot;to do&quot; list. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What ideas? Or is this private information?
:) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'll tell you when the product is finished, I don't want to reveal anything
until it's ready, as with my virus project I am working on. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, how about <A HREF="engine1.htm#ART">ART</A>
(Antigen's Radical Tunneler), any comments about it? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I've looked at it and it looks very nice, but I won't use other peoples
code in my viruses. I rather bother to make an own tunneler instead. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What makes the tunneling code in ART so special
you think? Isn't it a waste of bytes to use as much as 1407 bytes for tracing
interrupts? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, consider this: you program a virus that uses ART (1407 bytes),
regular code to infect COM and EXE files (maybe 400 bytes), bootsector
and partition record infection (512 bytes in every case) and some stealth
and a polymorphic engine (larger than 1024 bytes for sure). That will make
a *huge* virus! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, but was that really an answer to my question?
:) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Let me put it this way. There are far more easier tricks that also work
and that will take at most 400 bytes. I don't care if ART works with DosEmu
of Linux. How many people will use that? I rather write a normal tracer
that detects and skips TBDRIVER in memory. There are a few other monitors
that block tracing, but TBDRIVER is the most common program used, I think.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, and it only takes about 15 bytes to disable
tbdriver anyway, a lot of viruses does that, but do you consider it a waste
of bytes to include ART for tunneling-stealth? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, I do. The idea was very nice, but it won't be used by virus writers.
I rather use that 15 byte code you mentioned and then trace to the original
interrupt 21h. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, ok. It's the same thing as with polymorphic
engines; Noone will use them except for their creators, still Antigen released
2 versions of ART, but no virus using them. Hmm. Ok, let's go on with something
complete different, shall we? (* Sidnote: VLAD#5 included a virus of Antigen
which used ART, this interview was though done before vlad5 was released
*) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Uh, OK... (Eddie Murphy intonation (RAW)) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok ;). So, how are you in a private matter?
As most news-paper would describe us (remorsless, rebellion teen with an
attitude, a social failure, a malajusted misfit, a . . . . :)), or ? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm a very quiet person, there aren't many people that like me, because
I don't value properties belonging to someone else. Hence the virus spread
on college. I didn't care if they lost their project because of that. The
only thing I like is an escape from reality, preferably with booze or role-playing.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, &quot;rather flee the (insane) reality
of today, then facing it&quot; :). So, how did your parents react when
you was kicked out from school? Mine didn't like that very much I can tell.
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmm. After their divorce they just fight with eachother about the house
and the money and me and don't listen to me anymore. I can't talk things
with them and when they found out I was kicked from school my mother just
said I should not hang out on the streets. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So, your mother wants half? :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Half of what? I don't like talking about it, it caused me a lot of pain.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Uh, (Just a RAW joke, ya'know.. no worries!).
Hmm (sorry!), So when did you start with computers and this sort of things?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmmm, I don't exactly know at what age I started (I think 12 or so),
but I used a MSX at that time. At college I had to work with PCs, and to
buy me off, my father purchased a computer for me (to get in favor again).
Now I use his present to make viruses HAHAHA! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You think he would approve? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know. I never told him and I won't care either. I rather leave
my parents at once and live on my own. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You seem to say &quot;I don't care&quot; often
:) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Why should I care about something if nobody cares about me? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Probably because people only will care about
you if you care about them in the first place? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I once cared about my parents, you know. But after they divorce they
seem to have forgotten they still had a son. And why should I bother cleaning
up their messy life? But enough about that, let's continue talking about
viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Sure. How many and which viruses has you written
to this day? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I have written 3 resident EXE viruses, 2 resident companion viruses
(one of them uses interrupt 28h (dos idle) to infect as fast as possible),
2 non-resident COM infectors (one using <A HREF="engine2.htm#RTFM">RTFM</A>)
and a multipartite COM infector (Andropinis) and now a stealth bootsector
virus (Uniform). </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Quite some collection. . . Which virus group
did you vote as no #1 as for VLAD#5, and how does your voting in general
look? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Vote? I didn't get a vote thing! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Uh, ok, nevermind, it was a voting (kinda who's
the best thing concerning groups, viruses, writers and so forth.. ), but
ok, without your result being published, which group are you in favour
of? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I would rank VLAD as the best, because they are very inventive. The
best virus I saw was Natas, it was very good programmed. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, now, let's discuss av-programs/persons
and so forth so the AVers also can enjoy this thing, shall we? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>What do you want to discuss about them? You mean if I like some of them
or not, if their program is good or not? Hmmm, I don't like AVers at all,
they all bear some resemblence with Alan Solomon, so I don't wish to talk
to them. The antivirus program I like is TBAV, F-PROT and AVP, the rest
is not interesting, save for spoofing them with a virus. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">I agree you concerning the AV-programs, however
I'm afraid that my attitude towards the AVers somehow has become better
during the years - less hostile and perhaps less agressive as well. Hm,
why do you have this bad-attitude towards AVers that hasn't done anything
to you? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They would if they had the chance to, I don't say I hate them, but I
won't discuss things with them or even talk to them. They won't see me
as a person, but as a virus writer, so I consider talking to them as a
waste of time. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, what if I was a researcher as well, wouldn't
you then talk to me either? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't like dual edged swords, if you know what I mean. So, then I
won't talk to you. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, before we continue then, sure I make an
anti-virus to one of my own viruses, but released another better virus
in the remover for it, would that be acceptable? (* This is the Petra-rm
story.. *) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HAHAHA! Why yes, ofcourse it does. Making a remover for a virus doesn't
say you are a researcher, and spreading a virus in it is a great idea.
I think I'll hack McAfees scanner for a virus of mine. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, that is a great idea I think. But I did
a lot of research before writing that virus, now - isn't that to be a virus-researcher?
:) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, but not acknowledged. With researchers I mean Alan Solomon, Fridrik
Skulason, Frans Veldman etc. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, AV-researchers that is. Ah well, nevermind.
so what makes you think the AV-programs named above makes them interesting?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The programs do their job, as supposed to. F-PROT has an accurate identification,
TBAV has pretty good heuristics and AVP has very nice virus demonstrations
in it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any comments about VSUM and Patricia Hoffman?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HAHAHAHHA!! </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">That is suppose to mean that she is the biggest
failure in the community? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, not exactly, she made money with it, so she is not a failure. But
I don't value VSUM. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Because of the oh-so-holy messed up descriptions
of 99% of all viruses included within? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. I don't know how she manages that. She surpassed me with fucking
up descriptions. I just described Andropinis very well, so she can simply
copy it into her database. I don't like if she messes up descriptions of
my viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">No, who wants his children to be called cripples
when they're not? Hmmm :). </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Definitely not me. I think she lost track describing viruses when the
rate of discovered viruses increased rapidly. Hmmm, this turns out to be
a whole conversation instead of an interview, but that's no problem :)
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">When the viruses began to increase very rapidly
was in 1992 or so I reckon, was you into viruses back then? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I didn't write viruses, I just collected them. I even bought &quot;The
Virus Clinic&quot; at that time. But he got busted by the beast. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">are you refering Alan Solomon as the beast?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>He is! He just does that to get his face in front of the cameras again
and doesn't give a shit about the rest. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">I agree ;). Hence the articles published in
IR#5. Hm, but what do you think about his program? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I never seen it, just heard of it. It's supposed to be good, but I can't
judge it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Due to the fact that you hate him? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, because I don't have his product. I don't hate him, maybe fear him
is a more appropiate word for it. He's one bad motherf*cker. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, so have you been involved in any other
'underground' activity than virus-writing? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I used to hang out often in #hack, but since I started writing viruses
I left that channel to be more secure. I am not affiliated with any other
activities, I just started writing because the UK was too silent. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Well, not very strange due to the fact that
Dr.Solly has succeded in busted pretty much about every virus-writer in
the UK. I think you are the only english viruswriter left... </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Maybe there are others, I don't know. But I am certainly the only one
that now surfaces, yes. Maybe the fact that I am the only virus writer
in the UK makes me a bit famous. . </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, and maybe this little thought-to-be-an-interview
helps? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I don't know and do not care either. I just felt like talking to you.
Maybe it helps, indeed, and if that's so, it's fine. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So, how has the 'scene' and viruswriting influent
you in real life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It did not influent my life at all. Just instead of trading viruses
I started to write them myself. I think that's all. I don't have many activities
beside computing, except for drinking in a pub or so. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You seem to spend a awful lot of time behind
the computer because you can't find something better to do with your life.
You think it's really worth it? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I spend about 6 hours per day behind the keyboard, and about 5 days
a week, with maybe the exception if there's a good movie on the television.
Friday and Saturday are my &quot;day off&quot;. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Seems to me that your viruswriting is more
or less a job than a hobby, is that right? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It can't be seen as a job, because it serves no purpose at all. But
I have to stand up, otherwise the United Kingdom will perish in the virus
community. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Say, so what purpose does a politican serve?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Our goverment is real fucked up. Have you ever seen them? If they agree
to something they shout &quot;Yeah&quot; and otherwise they make sounds
like pigs. That's also a good description of them, pigs. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Agreed ;). So what is your opinion about politicans
trying to forbid the creation, spreading and even collecting/possesing
of computer viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>That will also include the victims of viruses, not just the underground.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yeah, ok - so remove the possesing then, do
you think creation of computer- viruses should be considered a crime in
any way whatsoever? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They just make it illegal because they don't have other good defences.
I think it's stupid. They can't do that, because they can't check everyones
computer. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Here we go with the clipper-chip again :).
Hmmm, but see it as a matter of principle then - not in any use (like most
other laws which only works theoretically), do you find it wrong or even
illegal to create viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No I think it's perfectly legal to make viruses. What I do on MY computer
is MY business, and not of the government, NSY or Alan Solomon! A law that
is just theorie is also utter useless, because it can't be used then. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What about spreading? Then the virus is not
only on your own computer. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If people want 'em, they got 'em. If unsuspecting victims get a virus,
they probably did not take the proper defences. If they are ignorant to
viruses, it's their own fucking fault, just like if you fuck without a
condom you might get AIDS. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">I fuck without condoms :). Anyway - people
know how to protect themself against real-life viruses (like aids), but
can you really expect everyone to use bullet-proof anti-virus programs
running TSR eating memory, or people to debug/disasm a program before running
them? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If you fuck without condoms that's your own choice. About users protecting
their systems: they don't have to be ASM experts, just check the incoming
(mostly illegal) programs or use an integrity checker, like the one of
Wolfgang Stiller. That should keep out most of the viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Still it's viruses that could sneak by his
program, does they also deserve to get struck with a (let's say) destructive
virus, slowly corrupting their data, making them lose their jobs, etc?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, then IM (* Integrity Master - TU *) is a ill-designed program and
should be improved. If a virus can sneak past it, it means IM (it's an
example of a CRC program) is not doing it's job right. It's not the fault
of the computer user then. And if he is in deep shit I don't really care,
but they better choose another program then. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Then who is to blame for them loosing their
job (or whatever)? The creator of the virus who (let's say) uploaded it
to a vx-board, the sysop of the vx-board, the one who downloaded it and
runned it on his harddisk, the person in question who copied a shareware-program
from the computer in question (without knowing it was infected), the author
of Integrity Master, the system administrator who is hired to keep the
computers secure and clean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HAHAHA! You won't trick me with questions like that! I am not to blame
whatsoever. The sysop of the vx-bbs can't be blamed, because all his leechers
know it's a virus. If the person that downloaded it runs it on his own
system it's his own fault. The person that copies shareware and brings
it to his work is out of line, but shouldn't lose his job for that. IM
can't be blamed for the man losing his job, only for mal- functioning.
The system administrator can't be blamed for the man losing his job either,
but he is not able to do what he is hired for: securing the system. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">So, you're saying that noone is to be held
responsible for him losing his job and even the whole fucking corporation
being ruined and that it was all by a fucking coincidende? Like fate as
some girl would have put it? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HO! Now you make another assumtion. Now you say the whole company is
ruined! That the man loses his job is a stupid decision of the staff. That
also causes people not to tell about the infection and even infecting other
computers to stay out of trouble. And who is responsible for Lloyds going
to the edge of ceasing to excist? They had some bad coincidences, and YES,
a virus could be one of them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Would you feel sorry if you had written the
virus in question? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not at all. I really don't care what would happen. I would regret if
a person in a hospital dies for some system fault, but not a company that
spends money from the &quot;Names&quot; and can't even do that right anymore.
A hospital is there to help people, most companies are there to get richer.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How can one regret something that one never
did? :) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HAHAHA! My child did it, not me! :) You have some point in there. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, how can you miss something that you never
had? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>You won't miss life after you are dead. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ugh, are you religious? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'm disappointed in religion. My parents married but now you see it
doesn't mean shit. It's just some situation, and can be undone easily,
but one of them got hurt. And that's not my father nor my mother, but me.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You said above that you didn't want to talk
about this incident, what made you change your mind? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It just happened. The whole thing made me realise that marriage doesn't
mean shit and that the ritual is a farce. The people that got better of
it was the church and the lawyers. I used to be religious once and went
to church every Sunday. Now I do not anymore, but I still believe. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hmmm, on channel #virus religion is quite a
well discussed topics, so why do you believe? I mean it's not that you
see any proof from a good god in today's soceity? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Who made this world? We weren't able to do that. But we are made in
his own image, that's why I create. But I don't like to discuss religion
now, because then we could chat for hours and hours. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, let's have some quick discussion about
religion anyways :). Then if God was good and created us (the human beings)
from his own image, wouldn't we be good then as well? Or does this mean
that you think mankind is good? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>How can you define good if there is no evil? One cannot excist without
the other. &quot;Good&quot; will lose it's meaning if there's no &quot;evil&quot;
to compare with it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hm, nice words, but personally, I think it's
just words invented by humans to be able to communicate better. Well, if
you couldn't compare bad and good then everything would probably be defined
as fucking perfect even though it wasn't, eh.. Like an Utopia or so. But
since we have completely slitted opinions about this, we might not discuss
this kind of things before we finish this interview. We don't want to argue,
now do we? :). </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>We can, but it's out of scope for the interview (it's not that anymore
it's a discussion that became very very large) I think. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea. Ok, let's us then stop talking about such
things as religion. About that little hospital incident above, do you believe
in poetical justice? Like if you die because of your own virus making the
computers on the hospital when you're being operated in useless? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If that happens I have nothing to worry about anymore. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, let's say that you instead of died got
a nice wheel-chair for the rest of your life! </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Then I'd rather take my own life, I think. But don't you think you are
now going too abstract??? </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">AH, sorry! I usually do :), when I get excited
about something. . . . (* This wasn't ment that I got exited about Rajaat
spending his life in a wheel-chair, btw.. I'm not that sick, really!!!)
Hmm, ok, have you heard of any new virus writing techinques btw? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Er... I think not. It's now just combining techniques, I think. Maybe
some people will come up with something good, but I can't think of anything
new. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">You think all virus-writing techniques for
DOS already are invented? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, but I just don't know what to expect anymore. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Ok, I better be going now, something else you
wish to say but never had the oppertunity to say before? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No, I think I have said what I wanted to say. I just will continue here
and keep NSY (* New Scotland Yard - ED *) busy for a while. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any greetings you would like to send out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Oh, yeah! I want to greet VLAD and P/S. I think that's all.. Oh, yeah,
ofcourse Immortal Riot! (* Thanks :)) *) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Not any personal greetings or goto hell messages?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>HAHAHA! Yes, go to hell, Dr. Solomon! And personal greetings to Qark
and Priest, might he ever read this. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Hmm, okay, nice talking to you, see you around,
(don't forget to send me that virus of yours), and keep up the faith! Taw-Taw
:). </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Sure, it was nice talking to you, I'll message you if I spot you again
on IRC, but don't expect me to come to #virus, I better stay out of there,
Hermanni also is there sometimes and maybe there are other researchers
there also. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Yea, sometimes.. well, as I said, better be
going, bye! </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Bye! </P>
