  [Summer 1999]</font></p>

<p align=justify><a href="groups1.htm#29A">29A</a> is one of the todays most active 
  groups and Benny/29A is one of their most active members, producing many W32-based 
  viruses in a short periods. We offer you and interview with this czech programmer:

<p><font color="#004080"><b>Who are you, where are you from and other personal 
  stuff ... </b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Hmm, Ok, lets start. I'm Benny from Czech Republic (the middle of the Europe) 
    and I'm member of 29A. Nowadays (summer 1999), I'm 17, I study computers on 
    highschool and writin' viruses, engines and tutorials for/about Win32 platformz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Benny, how did you get into computers?</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I always wanted have a computer becoz many of my friends had their own computer. 
    I became owner of my own PC, when I was 13. That was great time. I can remember, 
    that all friends were playin' games, but only I was interested in programmin' 
    and operatin' system itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Why did you start to be interested in viruses?</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When I had my own PC, I heard about some weird things, such as PC viruses. 
    But to hear wasn't enough for me and I wanted to know, how is it coded. I 
    was fanatic to AVs descriptions and I wanted to code my own virus. I bought 
    many boox, but nowhere was explained, how to code that. Then I found one perfect 
    book, where I found source codes of PS/MPC viruses and Aragon boot virus. 
    Great moment. I don't know, if I would be there, where I am without that book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Was your PC infected by any virus (besides your own)?</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Yeah, many times. My first computer was full of viruses. Then my friend borowed 
    me one great antivirus. It was AVG 3.0. It had perfect heuristix, comparable 
    with TBAV (maybe better). When u ran test of HD, it took program by program, 
    lists all instructions it steped, list all triggled flags and everything. 
    It could fake STEALTH viruses, it could read directly from disk, use XMS, 
    trace INTs and much more. And that had very nice interface. U should see that. 
    Wholy sci-fi! And it took me thinkin' about many things. Hehe, I can remember, 
    I was runnin' that AV three times per day and I wanted from AV to find some 
    virus, becoz I loved that feelin', when infected file was cleaned. Weird? 
    Yeah, who said I'm not, hehe X-D?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What programming languages can you use?</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>My first language was PASCAL. Then I was very interested in ASM. When I had 
    holidays, I decided I should learn C/C++. Two months of readin' some boox 
    and I know everything about it. Then I know Delphi (a little only), Java (look 
    at my page) and some scriptin' langs, such as HTML or JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What's your favourite programming language and why?</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I l0ve assembler. I can do everything, that I can't do elsewhere. I hate 
    objects, visuals, components and sh!tz such like. Who doesn't know any low-level 
    language ain't coder, but developer. Everybody can click and so create program, 
    what it ain't thing I wanna do. If I can't see all resources it takes, whole 
    source, registers, opcodes and otherz, I don't like it. I like to optimize 
    and fully optimize my code and have fully control of my programm I can only 
    in assembler. I don't like ppl, which don't like assembler 8-).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you get into vx comunity?</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When I was surfing on internet, I found link to WM.CAP. There was link to 
    29A page and there I downloaded <a href="ezines1.htm#29A">29A#2 magazine</a>. 
    That was nirvana. I haven't ever seen so kewl zine as 29A#2 (except of this, 
    ofcoz X-D). There I found some link to IRC. I didn't know, what da hell that 
    IRC is. After some friends advices, I downloaded some client for IRC and went 
    to hispanola IRC. Huh, I had a BiG luck. There were many good coderz at the 
    same time and everyone was on-line! Everyone wanted to show me his page, they 
    wanted to chat with me and when I said "I'm interested in Win32", noone stood 
    under the control. I won't ever forget for that moment, when Darkman said: 
    "Hey guy, u r that coder, we r lookin' for. Join 29A!". I couldn't believe, 
    that the best VX group ever wants lammer such me. They said they wants me 
    in da 29A and I thought, it ain't possible, it's only a dream. Then, I decided 
    I must do everything to join that group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What can you tell us about your first virus?</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Hehe, it's funny story. If I'll forget to my first lame PASCAL EXE append 
    virus, my first virus was Win32.Eva. That time, I hadn't any motivation and 
    I promised myself, I will code something really kewl. Then it happened. I 
    fell in the love with some nice girl. And becoz she didn't know it and it 
    happened on Friday, start of weekend, I didn't know, what I should that dead 
    weekend do. I decided it would be better to code something. By those three 
    days, I coded, commented and debugged my first (Win32) virus. (Un)fortunately, 
    Eva knows sh!t about computers and maybe it's better. However, I must give 
    her all my thanx, becoz that was perfect enter to VX scene. Darkman was dead, 
    when I said him "I have a virus for u. It's Win32.Eva and it's coded by me".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>And the sure followed next pieces from your workshop. 
  Tell us more about them.</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Hmmm, there r many pieces from my workshop. And if u won't be bored of that, 
    I will list here all I coded. <br>

<p><font color="#004080"><b>What your best virus you have ever written and what

<blockquote> 
  <p>Ok, my best virus is always that last one and everytime, I code something 
    new, it's better than my previous work. Well, my best virus is for now Win98.BeGemot. 
    It is first Win98 EXE/SCR/RAR/SFX/CPL/DAT/BAK resident, ring3, ring0, Pentium+, 
    multithreaded, compressed, stealth, slow poly, fast infector, which contains 
    communication interface that allows u to communicate with virus, if it's in 
    memory. It uses SEH, undocumented opcode, and many more new features, by which 
    is now undetectable by any AV. This is virus I'm the most proud of...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>How did you get in 29A and what is the feeling 'to 
  be in'?</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Hehe, I don't know, how did I get in 29A. I wrote 3 viruses. And as I heard, 
    my third one (Win32.Leviathan) was the thing, by which I am 29Aer. Thanx g0d 
    X-D! When Reptile and Darkman said, I'm in 29A, I thought I will jump thru 
    the window. It everything I wanted and when it came to me, I was 5 minutes 
    in trans. That feelin' was great, really. Now what r my feelings? I won't 
    lie u, I'm very proud on myself that I'm in 29A. It happens sometimes in your 
    life only, that u r part of something great and that u r first human in the 
    world, who did something. But becoz I promised to all 29A stuff I will do 
    impossible for our group, I'm tryin' to do that. And also I won't forget my 
    beginner ages so I try to help every beginner as much as I can. Everytime 
    I do something, I ask myself, if that thing I did is right and if I'm lammer 
    or if I'm not. Be selfcritic, that's very important thing. Think about u and 
    about things, u did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What are the most important technological advances 
  in virus writing?</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>We r breakin' unbreakable. Still remember those old ages, when some guy XORed 
    his virus and all AV world was absolutly mad of it? Now we use hi-technologies, 
    such as poly, meta, stealth, anti-heur, anti-debug and things such like. We 
    learn operating system and we know more, becoz we want it and becoz its our 
    hobby. Without us, everybody would be developer or guy from microsoft. Without 
    us, everybody would think on and on, that Windows is the best 32bit (huh) 
    system in da world. We breakin' the law, we want know more and we know it.</p>

  <p>They r very smart ppl. Noone, who don't understand system at least as good

    VXerz r stupid kiddos and again all VXerz means same about AVerz. To code 
    kewl virus u must know OS and to analyse kewl virus, u need it same. It's 
    wrong to compare two uncomparable things, such as to code tiny COM infector 
    and to analyse OneHalf.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Hmm, not much. I think, there ain't any VX scene in czech republic. Many 
    ppl may remember viruses such as Halloween, Raptor, Semtex, etc. That time, 
    when there weren't any Windozes, czech was full of VX writers. Now, I don't 
    know any ppl from Czech Republic, which is interested in Win viriis. That's 
    a pity. Our ppl r full of potential and entusiasm...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Now the same question, but the Dark side of the force 
  - Czech AV producents - how are the products, are they worth of testing against 
  new viruses etc ...</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I don't like czech AV products very much. I know, that czech AVAST! is the 
    best scanner in the world. AVAST! reached 100% border in Virus Bulettin as 
    the first scanner in the world. But AVAST!, over 100% virus detection hasn't 
    any heuristix, so I don't like it very much. Same as czech AVG. AVG has heuristix 
    for DOS files, but still not for Win32 files. That's baaaad. But let's wait... 
    we will c... <br>
    <br>
    Yeah, when I gave to one czech AV firm pattern of Win98.Milennium, they said, 
    there ain't any viriis. When I asked them, on which OS they tested it, they 
    said: "Win95". I said, it is Win98 specific virus and they replied: "hmmm, 
    maybe." Ignorants!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Once, you told you know some AVG ppl, how is(are) 
  the person(s) like?</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Yeah, I know them, but I don't wanna explain here detaills, becoz they would 
    have some problems with it. Some other AV firm could say, they have contact 
    with VX ppl and that could be big pain for Grisoft. There ain't any contact, 
    but however, ppl r jerx. Yeah, they have very nice secretaries (really! X-D) 
    and those ppl r very, very smart. But similarly as other AVerz, they say we 
    VXerz r only kids without any morals. But that is only their problem, rite? 
    Nevertheless, I must say, that ppl from Grisoft r really very smart. No doubt!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Now, let's discuss some vx technologies, what do you 
  think about use and perspectives of stealth, polymorphism, viruses under "other" 
  operating systems ...</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>New operating systems, more holes, new/more places for viruses, new techs, 
    etc. Viruses will stay with us. We will find new techniques for our babes, 
    new ways for hidin' them, new targets to infect, etc. Now, it seems it will 
    be metamorphism. What will be next? Who knows...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>What do you think about payloads in viruses and especially 
  the destructive ones?</b></font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Payload is the only thing, that should be visible to user. It's the way, 
    how to show user virus presency. But destructive payloads, they r all lame. 
    Many users will have problems with it and many AVs will rig money only becoz 
    of some lammer. We will be more "persecuted" and we will have more and more 
    problems. Destructivity ain't product of smart ppl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#004080"><b>Your opinion to the topic macroviruses and their perspectives:</b></font> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When I tried to code macrovirus for WinWord97, I did it in a minute. Macrovirus 
    can be beginnin', but codin' it is too much easy for ppl, which can do more 
    than click and create. Normal viruses has more chances to be spreaded out 
    than macroviruses. Computer can run without editor, but not without OS. However, 
    I think macroviruses r still very perspective.</p>

  <p>I have many favourite meals, such as grill chix, pizza, hamburgers and so 
    on. My favourite drink is beer and juice. Music, music is one of my most favourite 
    things. And becoz I'm very weird human, I like both of light pop (e.g. ABBA) 
    and hard rock (Lucie, Black Sabath, ...), sometimes I like also metal (Marilyn 
    Manson). I like groups, which plays their own style. I like originality and 
    I hate commerce. When there is group, which plays only for money, it ain't 
    good band. And if there is group, which plays originaly and plays its own 
    style, I can always find something great in it. What I like is oldies, becoz 
    they played their own style, they had been originaly and they didn't play 
    only for money. <br>
    My favourite pub? Hahaha, I would be very silly, if I would tell ya it. Sorry. 
    But I can say, that I love every pub, where I can find any czech beer. <br>
    My last &lt;drug&gt;, which I use is nikotin. Yeah, I smoke cigs. I try to

    than work with viriis. Other plans r very unbright. I would like to study 
    university, but I know I'm not so smart. Well, I hope I will do something, 
    I will really like.<br>
    <br>
    Thanx for givin' me place for talkin' about myself and I hope u weren't bored. 
    See ya sometimes, somewhere... </p>
