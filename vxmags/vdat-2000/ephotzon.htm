<TD>Your computers could be shut down for a day by an evil virus. How do
you immunize yourself against this threat? IBM is applying neural networks
to the problem. <BR>
</TD>

<TR>
<TD>AT EVERY MOMENT, while the world moves on unheeding, a titanic battle
is being fought in the far reaches of cyberspace. Each day a small number—about
200—of computer vandals construct a half-dozen or so new viruses. Each
day a tiny group of about 30 antivirus researchers work feverishly to analyze
these viruses and come up with antidotes. 
<P>Viruses range from merely pesky nuisances that flash a &quot;Gotcha!&quot;
on the screen of a victim to malicious programs that erase valuable data
files or render computer networks unusable. The bad guys have on their
side a lot of idle hours and the handy Internet, over which they trade
notes and even samples. The good guys have, besides their wits, some artificial
intelligence on their side. They have figured out how to use so-called
neural networks—computer programs trained to detect patterns—to spot newly
hatched viruses that have not been seen before. </P>

<P>This summer a midwestern bank with roughly 200 servers and 10,000 desktops
was shut down for four days when a virus froze its network. It could not
process wire transfers. Branch offices were locked out of the system. Customer
accounts could not be accessed. An emergency visit from an antivirus firm
cured the infection. </P>

<P>An internal Forbes computer network was paralyzed for a day by a virus
earlier this year. Reliable sources indicate that some of our competitors
have had the same problem more recently. &quot;Security professionals know
about these attacks,&quot; says Ralph Langham, computer service officer
for the U.S. Trust Co. &quot;The general public does not.&quot; </P>

<P>The battle between the bad guys and the good guys is about even now,
but the good guys have to work harder to keep up. There are several reasons.
First, the virus creators are older and more sophisticated than they were
a decade ago. Second, they can share information more easily. &quot;In
the past virus-writers were mostly clever teenagers who had limited resources,&quot;
says Sarah Gordon, security analyst at Command Software Systems in Jupiter,
Fla. &quot;These days many are in their thirties and have network access.
They collaborate globally using the Internet and write tighter code.&quot;</P>

<P>The most important reason for the proliferation of viruses is the explosive
growth of corporate networks, often hooked to the Internet. In such an
environment viruses spread readily, as a plague would spread through New
York's subway system. </P>

<P>&quot;Traditional methods of detecting and removing viruses depend on
expert analysis by humans and the distribution of a cure to users,&quot;
explains Steve R. White, a senior manager at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. &quot;These are orders of magnitude too slow
to deal with viruses that spread globally within hours or minutes.&quot;

<TD>IBM is at the forefront of virus detection and removal technology.
Its researchers have developed one of the neater techniques, using neural
networks, for automatic detection of the most prevalent class of viruses—so-called
&quot;boot sector&quot; viruses. The boot sector is a small sequence of
code stored on a diskette or hard disk that on IBM-compatible machines
is exactly 512 bytes long and that orients your computer when you turn
it on. Mess with this code and you can hypnotize the computer into doing
things it shouldn't be doing—like erasing files without permission. There
are more than 10,000 strains of viruses for IBM compatibles, and only a
few hundred of these are boot-sector viruses. But until recently, boot-sector
infections accounted for more than 80% of all virus incidents. (In the
past several months, &quot;macro&quot; viruses, which spread via dirty
spreadsheets and word processor documents, have become a severe problem.)

<P>Neural networks are a form of artificial intelligence in which a computer
simulates the way in which human brains process information. Explains IBM's
White, &quot;A neural network learns pretty much the way a human being
does. Suppose you say 'big' and show a child an elephant, and then you
say 'small' and show her a poodle. You repeat this process with a house
and a giraffe as examples of 'big' and then a grain of sand and an ant
as examples of 'small.' Pretty soon she will figure it out and tell you
that a truck is 'big' and a needle is 'small.' Neural networks can similarly
generalize by looking at examples.&quot; </P>

<P>Traditional computer programs use statements like &quot;if this, then
that&quot; to instruct the computer on what it has to do. Mechanical rules
like that are a large part of automatic virus detection: If a questionable
piece of software includes a segment that matches the signature of a known
virus, then the software is infected; reject it. </P>

<P>The neural net is aimed at situations that are more ambiguous. It is
designed to detect a new virus that shares subtle features with known viruses
but does not necessarily match them line for line. </P>

<P>The neural network starts with no rules built in. The rules evolve.
You show the net a series of key measurements from an infected piece of
software, then the measurements for a piece of clean software. Now here's
another infected piece of code, now another clean one. On its own, the
neural net will pick up a pattern. </P>

<P>One problem: The number of training examples has to be far greater than
the number of measurements being assessed. It is not uncommon to use tens
of thousands, even millions, of observations to train a neural net. In
a 1995 <I>Virus Bulletin </I>conference in Boston, a researcher presented
a paper on why neural networks could not be used to detect computer viruses:
There weren't enough samples to train them. <BR>
 </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Gerald Tesauro, 37, who has a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton and landed
at IBM's Hawthorne lab in 1988, found a way to use neural nets on viruses
nonetheless. There aren't enough samples to train the net? His solution:
Don't feed entire viruses to the net; feed virus particles. 
<P>Tesauro digested computer code into sequences of three bytes and extracted
those likely to be present in viruses but not in legitimate programs. These
triplets then became the bases of a neural net. There turned out to be
just enough examples to train a neural network using this approach. The
net told Tesauro how many demerits to give for each of the different suspect
triplets found on a questionable boot sector. Enough demerits, and you
put the questioned piece of code in quarantine. </P>

<P>In these diagnostic routines it's just as important to avoid false accusations
as to finger the guilty. If a program or file is thought to be infected
when it is not, a company turns its network upside down in a hunt for a
nonexistent infection. Work is disrupted, and fear of viruses spreads,
along with distrust of the protective software. </P>

<P>IBM's neural nets have virtually eliminated false positives. &quot;Our
program is on millions of desktops and has detected about a half-dozen
previously unknown boot viruses,&quot; says White. &quot;There have been
only three false positives, and all of these were security programs whose
codes share many similarities with viruses.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;We had a severe virus problem until 1992,&quot; says U.S. Trust's
Langham. &quot;Machines would lock up. Technicians would not understand
the problem and experiment with changing disk drives and other pieces of
hardware. An average infection hit 50 or so desktops. Now that we have
a good software shield in place, we have less than 1 machine infected [per
incident].&quot; Langham uses IBM software, enhanced with neural-net technology.
</P>

<P>IBM isn't the only firm with new defenses against the virus spreaders.
Symantec has a spider that cruises the Internet, looking at 500 known virus
transmission sites and also randomly downloading files. These files are
checked for viruses, using various automated analytical engines. </P>

<P>But then the bad guys are getting rather creative, too. Computer vandals
have created polymorphic viruses that mutate each time they infect a computer,
making immunization much more difficult. They have taken to encrypting
viral code so it cannot be detected while inactive. </P>

<P>The good guys have retaliated by creating safe &quot;virtual computers&quot;
where viruses can be tricked to deliver their payloads. They are then detected,
analyzed and zapped. </P>

<P>In a well-guarded laboratory at IBM's Hawthorne office, Jeffrey Kephart,
manager of antivirus science and technology, demonstrates what the future
will bring. He infects a PC with a simulated unknown virus. The protection
program detects it instantly and captures the viral code, sending it securely
to an analysis computer sitting a few yards away. The virus is analyzed,
a signature extracted and an antidote developed and sent back. Elapsed
time, less than five minutes. Sometime next year IBM aims to install a
system like this over the Internet to its customers. </P>

<P>So who's going to win this battle, the viruses or the virus hunters?
That's too hard to predict, but here's a pretty safe forecast: Corporations
are going to have to spend more and more money on self-defense. </P>
