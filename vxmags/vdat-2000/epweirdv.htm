<p>When Alpha was a computer science major at a Manila university, a professor 
  in one subject failed him, giving him a grade of &quot;5&quot;. In revenge he 
  wrote a virus he called &quot;singko&quot; (5), which invades a PC and then 
  flashes a diatribe against teachers. </p>
<p>Alpha is the pseudonym of a computer programmer, one of many who hang around 
  in a strange shadowy region of the Internet. It's an underground world dotted 
  with websites for Filipinos obsessed with one thing: viruses. </p>
<p>In these cybernooks, some of which have IP addresses that are concealed or 
  difficult to remember, programmers discuss, analyze, criticize and display their 
  work. Most of the sites are now down, but the few I managed to wander through 
  made me feel I was in a very peculiar world, eerie and tacky at the same time. 
  Like being inside the set of a bad science fiction novel -- &quot;Blade Runner 
  meets Count Dracula.&quot; One website, the <a href="groups2.htm#PVW">Pinoy 
  Virus Writers</a> webpage is mostly black with a tasteful graphic of dripping 
  blood. </p>
<p>Nobody who goes to these sites gives his or her real name. The programmers 
  all use aliases -- &quot;handles&quot; or &quot;protected mode names&quot; -- 
  like Destro Ex or Brianjan. I've never met any of them face-to-face but the 
  impression I get reading their posts is of very young guys, cocky and maybe 
  highly skilled. </p>
<p>Some of them sound immature and few of them can write grammatically perfect 
  English. Some prefer to post in Pilipino. Suprisingly, a lot of them are from 
  the provinces. A university in Batangas, San Carlos University in Cebu, are 
  among the institutions claimed as alma mater. </p>
<p>I know these things thanks to the one trait nearly all virus writers have in 
  common.. Arrogance. They're so arrogant that they post snippets of their biographies 
  on the sites they visit. The computer chips on their shoulders give them bragging 
  rights so extensive they even include their names in the viruses they create.I 
  heard that when the virus writing community found out how potent ILOVEYOU proved, 
  there was a rush to claim involvement in the project. </p>
<p>A thirst for learning is another characteristic of many virus writers. They 
  want to know how to accomplish certain effects, creating a self-replicating 
  file for sneaking into a system (delivery) and unloading an unwanted program 
  (the payload). Often the programming is its own reward. </p>
<p>The virus writing sites stress that they exist strictly for educational purposes. 
  &quot;DISCLAIMER:&quot;, says one of them,&quot;Site has HARD CORE JavaScript 
  implementations. Enter with CAUTION . Some materials contain harmful or offensive 
  information. The contents and files in this webpage is solely for EDUCATIONAL 
  PURPOSES only . The author and contributors will not be held accountable for 
  any damages of ANY kind.&quot; Some of the sites store live viruses for visitors 
  to download and study. . </p>
<p>On <a href="groups1.htm#AST">astigmatizm</a>.cjb.net (currently down), virus 
  writer ksg gives his (or her) age as 19 and school as AMACC. &quot;I have written 
  a few simple Word and Excel macros,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish to learn more 
  and venture into more complicated viruses.&quot; Another programmer, heX wreX 
  n effeX says he too is 19 and from AMACC.&quot;I think its impossible to have 
  a career with DOS viruses. Im currently into macros &amp; VBScripts </p>
<p>The goal of all virus writers, as one site exhorts, is to &quot;keep the infection 
  alive.&quot; I've been told that there are programmers who've coded ferocious 
  digital beasts which they never unleash on any system, they just want to study 
  it and test their own skills.Then there are the programmers who fully intend 
  to turn their creations loose on the world. &quot;I want a simple write for 
  geting into someelse's computer&quot; writes one visitor to a site. </p>
<p>It seems the only thing that matters to such virus writers (strictly speaking 
  they're not &quot;hackers&quot;) is the acclaim of peers. &quot;All virus writers 
  are playwrights and computers lousy actors&quot;, proclaims one site. The consummate 
  hacker is someone who can make the biggest impression while keeping his identity 
  secret from all but the inner circle. Apparently pay no attention to the consequences 
  of letting their viruses out into &quot;the wild.&quot; </p>
<p>Writing in the aftermath of the ILOVEYOU assault, Destro Ex posts: &quot;Damn 
  kids does it again .., heh, dont get caught spyder!&quot; </p>
<p>It's as if mastery of programming languages confers the status of nobility. 
  Those who don't know the skills deserve everything they get. As it trashes a 
  document file, one Word macro virus flashes this message to the hapless victim: 
  &quot;Michael Learns To Hack -- And Hope You'll Learn From It Too.&quot; </p>
<p>Hand in hand with arrogance is a sense of elitism. To virus writers the the 
  world is divided along very clear lines. On one side are the cool guys, computer 
  programmers who get it, who have what they believe to be consummate mastery 
  of coding. On the other side is the rest of the world, &quot;lamers&quot;, the 
  inferior programmers, the other hackers who also think highly of themselves. 
  And of course, us. Computer cattle. The dull, docile, placid, ignorant masses 
  who go about believing we know how to use PCs. </p>
<p>&quot;From the programmer's point of view&quot;, reads a quotation from the 
  &quot;Michael Learns to Hack&quot; site, &quot;a user is just a peripheral that 
  types whenever the program issues a read request.&quot; </p>
<p>The condescension is typical. Among the 15 points of etiquette in one site 
  are: no.2 &quot;No lamers allowed&quot;, no.8. &quot;No Stupid remarks or questions 
  unless you are really stupid.&quot; and no. 11. &quot;Please limit insults 100 
  per person. I think he she will get the idea.&quot; </p>
<p>Onel de Guzman is being questioned by authorities in Manila who want to know 
  why his rejected thesis proposal, a program for filching passwords from other 
  computers, bears a remarkable resemblance of one of ILOVEYOU's actions.Even 
  as he was sweating buckets of blood from nervousness during a press conference 
  where he was accompanied by a lawyer, de Guzman let a little of the elitism 
  show. When a reporter asked him if his sister was capable of coding a virus, 
  he replied in Pilipino, &quot;if you, a newscaster, were asked to do programming, 
  what would you know about it?&quot; </p>
<p>Dismiss this as nerdish disdain, as the posturings of insecure kids who need 
  to see sunlight more often. Then read this earnest request from a visitor in 
  one site: &quot;There is a guy who hates Warez and Virii sites. I want to give 
  him a lesson. Does anybody can help me with something that KILL his Hard Disk?, 
  not just his information.&quot; The marriage of arrogance with the technical 
  ability to wreak mass destruction has never been a happy one. </p>
<p>The programming elite has its own language. Viruses are &quot;virii&quot; or 
  &quot;vx&quot; for short. The newest term is supposed to be &quot;hpcav&quot; 
  -- &quot;hacking-phreaking-cracking-anarchy-virus&quot; </p>
<p>One site offers up this ethos: </p>
<p>&quot;We are the future of the computer age . We represent freedom ,not anarchy 
  . We represent equality not racism .We are the seeds to be reaped in the next 
  millennium We live in a virtual world , free from hatred ,free to speak what 
  we want, free from low life beings the real world holds . We live in what I 
  can call Utopia. </p>
<p>&quot;Since the birth of the computer. So did we. We were always there, denied 
  by the people who didn't understand, cannot contain us, envied us. So we lived 
  in the underground ...computer underground. But we liked it that way. No longer 
  shall we persecuted, no longer shall we labeled criminals, No longer shall we 
  be told what to do ...information will be free for everyone, information will 
  be fed to those in need, information shall never again be sealed.And to Accel, 
  There will be, No More Secrets ...&quot; </p>
<p>The truth is a virus writer usually has a dual persona. In the &quot;real&quot; 
  world he's probably a young, responsible and skillful programmer, perhaps a 
  student. In the &quot;virtual&quot; world he's a transformed person, one seeking 
  the overthrow of the computer systems he's running or studying. </p>
<p>It's an appropriate character for a world where nothing is as it seems, where 
  something turns out to be its opposite. A love letter is actually a computer 
  killing message of hate. The fastidiousness and tight discipline that goes into 
  coding is a stark contrast to the destruction it accomplishes. The openness 
  a programmer wants is achieved through dark secrecy of a conspiracy. </p>
<p>Why would a programmer write a virus? For petty reasons: years ago Jonjon Gumba 
  wrote &quot;Possessed&quot; because he was being neglected by his parents. For 
  the thrill of using programming skills. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; one programmer 
  remarks, &quot;when you're into something that's fun, you forget to think ahead, 
  you overlook things in your excitement. I suppose it might be something like 
  getting high on drugs.&quot; For peculiar motives. There's a story of one person 
  asking programmers for a virus to kill his parents' computer. </p>
<p>Why write a destructive payload? Isn't a program that infiltrates a system 
  enough cause for satisfaction? Why modify ILOVEYOU from a password stealing 
  virus to a destructive code? The reason, the programmer mentioned above replies, 
  is that &quot;the virus writers want to get noticed, to get talked about; if 
  you want your virus listed in antivirus program information, it should be destructive 
  or do something against antivirus programs.&quot; </p>
<p>It might seem hard to believe that a Third World nation like the Philippines 
  with a stone age President like Joseph Estrada could produce computer programmers. 
  The truth is the Philippines has been producing top caliber programmers for 
  years, and is second only to India as the favorite Asian country of recruiters 
  from American computer companies </p>
<p>The Filipino's knowledge of English helps. So does the proliferation of computer 
  schools like AMACC. And the Internet has also increased the learning opportunities 
  for programmers in general and for virus writers in particular. Scripts, codes 
  and advice are freely exchanged by programmers all over the world. </p>
<p>The result is a thriving community of virus writers. One site alone used to 
  lists more than 20 handles of Filipinos who 've written viruses. That part of 
  the site has since been taken down by its webmaster. </p>
<p>You might think of virus writers as highly skilled acolytes practicing black 
  magic -- jedi seduced by the Dark Side. Or you could just write them off as 
  pests. This is how the hackers like to characterize themselves when caught. 
  They're just juveniles carried away by youthful hijinks. It's hardly an image 
  in keeping with the way they project themselves as cyber ninja, sneaking in 
  and out of protected systems at will. But if it will hold off serious jail time, 
  don't knock it. </p>
