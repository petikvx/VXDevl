<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>What kind of person would create
a computer virus and set it loose in the world - an evil genius or a deranged
technopath? Sarah Gordon has spent years trying to answer that question
and her research has turned up some surprising results. Milly Jenkins reports.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Sarah Gordon didn't know much about
computers, let alone computer viruses, when she bought a second-hand PC
in the early 1990s and found herself &quot;the proud owner of not only
the PC but of the Ping-Pong virus as well&quot;. Like a bad bout of winter
flu, she couldn't shake it, nor could anyone else she showed it to. As
a last resort, she looked up a news group for virus writers and immediately
found someone who knew exactly how to get the Ping-Pong out of a PC. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Seven years on, she is now a leading
authority on computer viruses and works for IBM's virus lab in New York,
anticipating new viral threats and developing products for their detection.
But she is best known for her work on ethical computing and as a pioneering
anthropologist of the virus-writing underground. She has made it her mission
to find out who writes viruses and why. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>The Ping-Pong incident intrigued
her. A &quot;typical&quot; virus writer, she had assumed, was an &quot;evil,
depraved... technopathic, genius gone mad, a sociopath&quot;. But the ones
she came across in the news groups seemed like a nice, normal lot. Virus
writing may not be illegal, but it is certainly anti-social. So what was
the attraction? She wanted to find out what ethics motivated them to write
viruses. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>What she found was that, apart from
writing viruses, there was nothing very &quot;unethical&quot; about them
at all. In one study she interviewed a sample of 60 virus writers and compared
them with a model of ethical development formulated by the psychologist
Lawrence Kohlberg. They were mostly &quot;within the ethical norms for
their ages&quot;. There was no such thing, she also discovered, as a typical
virus writer, although they did fall into categories - the adolescent,
the student and the professional adult. They were almost exclusively male.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>They tended to be young, from middle-class
homes and with a keen sense of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;.
They were respectful of authority - not the angry, antisocial teenagers
you might expect. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;Justifications vary from 'we
can do this because we can', to 'we do this because someone said we were
not capable of doing it',&quot; says Gordon. Most said it was something
they just did and that they had never considered why. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>&quot;The impact of their actions
is often seen, at least by them, as impacting machines, not other human
beings.&quot; This shouldn't come as a surprise, she says. The impersonal,
dehumanised world of &quot;electronic communities&quot; is bound to make
some people behave differently. Anonymity, it has been shown, often prompts
people to behave in ways they wouldn't in the &quot;physical world&quot;.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Adult virus writers tended to be
more immature for their &quot;ethical development&quot; age groups, and
more likely to have chips on their shoulders. They spoke of their hatred
of hypocrisy and politicians, and saw themselves as fighting an &quot;enemy&quot;,
mostly defined as &quot;Society&quot;. Some saw virus writing as a right
- a form of free speech. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Most of them said they were battling
against the &quot;AV people&quot; - anti-virus experts, like Gordon. Fame
was a common motive - getting a virus discussed in news groups or written
about in the press was a major coup. The highest accolade was for a virus
to become so widespread that a scanning product to detect it was put on
the market. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>One of Gordon's aims in doing this
research, which she continues to update, is to demystify people's perceptions
about virus writing. &quot;The 'art' of writing viruses is vastly overrated
by the virus writers,&quot; she says. &quot;It is pretty simple to write
a virus, and real talent could be better shown by making useful software.&quot;
There are only 300 viruses currently circulating, although over 17,000
have been identified in the past. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Some viruses are serious. But even
these tend to get over-hyped, not least by the press, which loves a good
virus scare story. When the Michelangelo virus surfaced five years ago,
it prompted mass panic. Like the Friday 13th virus before it, it activated
on a certain date (6 March, the artist's birthday) and people predicted
it would wipe millions of hard drives clean in days. But in the end only
a few thousand computers were affected. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Gordon has interviewed some of the
more sophisticated virus writers - underworld celebrities spoken of in
hushed, admiring tones by their younger counterparts. When she published
<A HREF="ivdarkav.htm">an interview with one, an aggressive Bulgarian known
as &quot;Dark Avenger&quot;</A>, she was dubbed the Clarice Starling of
the virus world. He was Hannibal Lecter, and the interview does indeed
read like something from The Silence of the Lambs: after she made her first
attempt to contact him, via a bulletin board, his spooky response was to
dedicate his latest virus to her. &quot;Why didn't you contact me directly?&quot;
he asks in the interview. &quot;I was afraid of you,&quot; she replies.
&quot;You should see a doctor,&quot; he says. &quot;Normal women don't
spend their time talking about computer viruses.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>So why did he start writing viruses?
&quot;I think the idea of making a program that would travel on its own,
and go to places its creator could never go, was the most interesting thing
for me,&quot; he replies. &quot;The American government can stop me from
going to the US, but they can't stop my viruses.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Gordon believes that winning the
battle against the virus writers means taking a &quot;multi-disciplined
approach&quot;. Governments and courts can do little to help. But new technology
will, and IBM, like others, is currently developing &quot;an immune system
for cyberspace&quot; designed to automatically destroy all viruses including
new, previously undetected ones. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>She would also like to see schools
and universities teaching ethics as part of their computer science curriculum.
Her research has found that, like young criminals, virus writers mostly
grow out of their habit. The trouble is, there is always a new generation
to take their place, which is why education could help: &quot;We can't
sit idly by and expect our children to figure out for themselves what is
right and wrong.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Above all, she believes in the power
of persuasion. She spends a lot of time talking to virus writers, online
or at hackers' conventions, trying to challenge their views. &quot;Getting
people who write viruses to become 'ex' writers is, after all, a purpose
of my research,&quot; she says. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+0>Reasoned debate, she admits, doesn't
always work: &quot;I tell them why what they are doing is not always responsible
behaviour, and they tell me how what they do is not bad. We go round and
round a few times and usually part knowing that we just don't agree.&quot;
But it's still early days, she says. New technologies have accelerated
at such a breathtaking rate, it is hardly surprising that the ethical debate
has been left lagging behind. </FONT></FONT></P>
