<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I started out learning Qbasic and went up from there. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Early 1997, I came upon the Ripper virus...I was fascinated by the payload
and the the way it spread. (No, I didn't get infected by it.) I started
researching viruses and learned WordBasic. I wrote the Vicissitator and
got accepted into <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A>. I know am working
on ASM and plan on more interesting Viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>For Now I only would like to be know for the Vicissitator, I am still
knew to the scene, so expect more WordBasic and ASM viruses from me in
the future. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Naming is the most difficult part for me. I look through thesauri and
found synonyms for words that suit the virus. I then change the words into
a name. Look up vicissitude for the vicissitator. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>In order that I learned them: Qbasic, Visual Basic, WordBasic and ASM.
I was planning on learning more, but time is a limiting factor. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like ASM just because it is the most versatile language, creates the
smallest file sizes and is the fastest. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes. <A HREF="groups2.htm#SLAM">SLAM</A> </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I respect AVP because it makes the least amount of claims. I don't like
scanners that advertise that they are the best scanner. I dislike MSAV
just because...well how do I say this nicely? It sucks. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To make viruses that give AV the biggest pain in the butt. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I love the war. Whatever VX throws at AV, they find away around, and
whatever AV throughs at VX, VX finds away around. I believe there well
never be an AV that detects all viruses. The warfield will always be level.
If you need proof for this, just look at todays biological viruses. They
still exist, and no organism is immune to all of them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Cyber from Electronics, and Yoda from Star Wars. I took Yoda because
he alway had something wise/smart to say. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>They are a good programming challenge, but should not be written because
it give lamers the ability to create viruses without the knowledge to control/contain
them. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I wish people would quit saying that Macro virus writers are lame virus
writers. WordBasic and VBA is the only language Macro Virus writers have
to work with. I would gladly write Macro viruses in ASM if I could. I have
nothing against HLL but the best viruses are written in ASM just because
ASM is the fastest, smallest and creates the most versatile viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not yet... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A> for their high standards. (You guys
should accept new members so VLAD will never die.) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I like Bill Gates, for he gives VXrs new platforms for viruses. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I think destructive payloads should only be used to protect the virus
from being discovered. I detest viruses that format the hd. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No...but I don't think there is such a thing as a 'bad' virus, either.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I am a student. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Some do...some don't. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Yes, but not much. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>No. Yes. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A virus that performs complete evolutions, which enables it to avoid
present and future scanners. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>It has it good points and bad points. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Learn ASM, that way everything else will seem easy. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="mailto:cyoda@usa.net">cyoda@usa.net</A>, and on IRC on Undernet
#virus. </P>
