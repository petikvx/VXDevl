<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How did you start out in computers? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, I've been using computers since the Apple II came out, way back
in the day... Back then, it was basically for games, etc. but I got my
first experience with the &quot;underground&quot; scene (if you could call
it that, back then it really was more mainstream -- if you were using a
computer in the first place, you were somewhat a hacker, in the old sense
of the word) back in '85 or '86, I'd say, when I ran into a bunch of pirated
games for the Apple - Pac Man, I remember, was &quot;KRACKED BY OZZY&quot;
and Conan was released by the Pacific Pirates Guild... Old school, to the
max... Anyway, it was back then I first experimented with programming (aside
from BASIC, we all did that :) in the form of cracking games... First,
it was just hex-editing them, but then I became a bit more adventurous,
applying old versions of patches to new versions of games, changing offsets,
etc.... I never did anything all that complex, but it was a basis for the
rest of my computer knowledge. I started out, on the Apple, just about
as low-level as you could go, learned hex codes and pieced together not
quite a knowledge of, but a recognition of how machine language worked...
and altogether got a pretty good foundation to base myself on. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How and when did you start out in the virus
scene? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, I had heard about viruses back on the Apple, heard about boot
sector infectors for the Apple and for the Amiga, but had never seen one...
I had, surprisingly enough, found a copy of Ralf Burger's book in my local
library, and had learned about the old PC viruses, Vienna and such... My
first contact with viruses on the PC came with the board scene (I miss
it, don't we all...)-- some kid had maybe 20, 25 viruses on his board,
which me and a bunch of friends downloaded (I didn't have a PC back then,
I got mine in '93, this was back in '90 or '91 I'd say) and &quot;tested&quot;
out on our school computer. (&quot;Hey Neil, I dare you to hit enter and
run ANTHRAX.COM&quot; &quot;&lt;Click&gt;&quot; &quot;Fuck, we didn't mean
it... Run!&quot;) You know the drill... <BR>
Anyway, my first real experience with viruses came with the dawn of the
hacker scene on the internet, I found some site with a zip of a few hundred
files, executables and source codes, and fooled around with them... Managed
to wipe some of my files by accidently running them, you know. Anyway,
I eventually figured out how to use TASM and TLINK from reading the source
code files I got, and it just went from there... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you written viruses? If so which would
you like to take credit for? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Hmmm... Let's see. I'll take credit for 8Fish, Ahav, Airwalker, Envader,
Fyodor, Gobot, Gremlin, Jacov, Leprosy.Jobo, Ringworm, Ymir, and a few
assorted HLLO's. Others, you'll just have to guess... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">How do you name your viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>With whatever pops into my head. Sometimes, I think of a name and write
the virus for it, other times I write the virus first. But I find it hard
to complete a virus when it's still nameless; I find a certain ambiguity
of direction that only the virus's name, and thus character, can resolve.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which programming languages do you know? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Basic, Asm, Pascal, Turbo Pascal, Visual Basic, WordBasic, and a bit
of C... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What programming language do you like using
the most? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Depends on what... For general coding purposes, I usually use TP, as
I'm very experienced with it and can usually whip out a program fastest
in it... For viruses, definitely asm, nothing else cuts it... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you a member of a VX group? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not currently... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which AV software do you like/respect the most?
Which the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Well, overall I like (and use) F-Prot, TBAV, and AVP, all for different
reasons. For AVP, it's the heuristics and the detection. (Interface sucks,
though.) For TBAV, it's the heuristics (flags and all), as many less-than-intelligent
programmers will neglect to check if their program gets any flags at all...
It's a quick testing routine, nothing more really... And for F-Prot, it's
the interface, detection level, and naming scheme... I respect Dr. Solomon's
program and AVP for quick detection/removal of new viruses. And I dislike
McAffee and Norton, for two quick examples, for shitty code/detection/interface/removal
/false alarm rates and for their scissor-hold on the industry, advertising
their substandard products too damn persistantly. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What are your goals (VX wise)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nothing specifically, each virus I have written has been written simply
to see if I could write it... A programming excersise, more or less...
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on the continuous 'war' between
VX and AV. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Right now, there is no real war; we're all pretty much on friendly terms.
All the really good coders (ex-vlad, ir/g, etc...) are quite mature and
don't go for the petty bickering of the past... The only people I see who
feel there is a war are the newbies, the &quot;warez-d00dz&quot; of the
virus scene, those who don't really know any better... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where did you get you handle? What does it
mean? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Alternately, from some shitty Tolkien book I can't remember or from
an old-school CRPG called Dungeon Master... Gothmog's been my handle since
'87, '88 I'd say, so it's here to stay... No real reason to change it now.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Virus Creation software
(eg. VCL, PS-MPC etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A good _introduction_ to the virus world. True, they have in the past
been a tool for the lame, but even the lame learn eventually... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on macro viruses vs. assembly
or HLL viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>A nuisance, nothing more... I haven't really followed the macro virus
progression, but I understand there's a fuckload of them now... Again,
they're a good starting point; perhaps now, they may be a better starting
point, at least from the perspective of real-world practicality, than the
simple com infector. (when was the last time you ran an application (not
a dos utility mind you, a true application--game or word processor, say)
that used com files?) Anyway, they're an easy introduction to the world
of real coding, and hopefully all those macro virus programmers out there
will take their first steps into that great world. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses
'in-the-wild'? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Not as such, though a few have gotten fairly good UseNet exposure. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which VX E-zine do you like to most? Which
the least? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Truthfully, I haven't kept up, but I like <A HREF="ezines1.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>
of all the recent ones for style and information. The least? I dunno, anything
written with no true intelligence or insight behind it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
in the VX world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I'd have to say the late group <A HREF="groups2.htm#VLAD">VLAD</A>;
who else could make the New York Times? Again, style, intelligence, and
insight... VLAD had them all. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">In the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Definitely Dr. Alan Solomon, for one; few others show as much dedication
as he does to his customers' needs; most of the other av'ers who make regular
appearances on a.c.v gain my respect as well, at least those who are honest
and helpful to those in need. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Which individual or what group do you like/respect
outside the VX or the AV world? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I dunno, anyone who still remembers the good old days, when every computer
user knew exactly what he was doing; when every comupter user was a hacker
at heart. And I especially respect anyone who still is. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on destructive payloads in
viruses? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>To those who feel they must include destructive routines in their code,
I say this: Why must you build only to destroy? To do that is to act like
the outsider, when you can, and will be welcomed and respected by those
who see the value and truth that is inherent in the world of the computer.
</P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good'
virus? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Perhaps, perhaps not; 'good' touches on morality, a tricky subject indeed.
There is such a thing as a non-malignant virus, one that causes no harm
-- that is for sure. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What do you do in 'real' life? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Student&quot;, I suppose, would best describe my current situation...
As for what I do, it changes every day... :) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do people outside the VX scene know what you
do (parents, girlfriend etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Parents, no. Girlfriend, yes. Though she might as well be considered
part of the scene, at least in the know. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (Hacking,
phreaking, warez etc.)? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>I've experimented with hacking, phreaking, cracking, whatever... I know
how, but they usually don't inspire me towards action. More sort of background
knowledge, I can call on the skills if I need them. I was into warez for
a while, but you know how it is... I'll still browse the newsgroups if
I need to find a program, but that's about it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference
between creation and spreading? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Intentionally spreading a virus to someone's computer should be illegal,
but not, say, posting it to usenet or to someone's ftp server. Like, if
someone brings a disk with a virus on it to some big company's computer,
sits down, puts the disk in, and _runs_ the virus, that should be illegal,
and probably already is. But just posting viruses to usenet or ftp or web
sites shouldn't. Basically, intentional, malignant attempts to destroy
data are wrong, and should be illegal, but that's about it. (I'm not talking
like a felony or anything, maybe like a small fine or something unless
millions of dollars are really lost or for repeated offenses) </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Describe the perfect virus. </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Why, simply, one that cannot be detected nor removed, and one that spreads
to anything; mac, ibm, unix; com, exe, doc, maybe even text files. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your view on Windows (95) </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>About Win95, I don't care what anyone says, it's better than Windows
3.1. Anyone who disagrees with that is pretty damn stupid. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What is your advice for people just starting
out? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Read all the text files you can find, experiment with other source code
files, learn how to assemble them. Maybe read a book, or something... Follow
a tutorial, starting from the simplest virus there is. (Try <A HREF="tutorial.htm#RB">Ratboy's</A>,
though it's shitty as hell for real virus programming, it's easy to understand
for beginners.) Buy a book on assembly language. Ask questions. And above
all else, stick with it. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Where can you be reached if at all? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>If you need to find me, you will. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What part of the world do you come from? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>The United States, CT to be exact. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">What future releases are you planning? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nothing planned, just whatever happens to pop into my head or inspire
me; that's how I write everything. </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Are you considering joining a VX group? If
yes, which one? </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Nope... </P>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080">Any follow-ons on <A HREF="creatrs1.htm#DREG">DREG</A>?
</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
<P>Perhaps, though I lost the original source code due to a complete HD
melt-down. (And I thought Western Digital Caviar's were supposed to be
good...) We'll see... </P>
</UL>
