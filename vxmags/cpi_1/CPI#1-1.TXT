                              -------------------
 
      Welcome  to  "Computer  Viruses  - A Protagonist's Point Of View." This 
 letter,  perhaps  the  beginning of a small newsletter. Well, this "letter," 
 is  written  by  one person right now, maybe I'll get some people to send in 
 more  info,  ideas,  and  examples  to CPI. If you would like to contribute, 
 please  upload  text  files to CPI Headquarters (see heading for number) and 
 leave a note to me telling me you are contributing to our magazine.
 
      Well,  as  an  overview,  this  article will cover a few topics dealing 
 with  viruses; however, there will be no examples covered as we are short of 
 programmers  at  the  moment. That reminds me, if you would like to become a 
 member  of  CPI, fill out the accompanying text file and upload it to CPI HQ 
 as  an upload to the Sysop, then leave me and the Sysop some mail to tell us 
 you  registered  to  become  a  member.  We  will get back to you as soon as 
 possible.
 
      The  purpose  of  this  magazine  is  to expand and broaden the general 
 computer  user's  view and knowledge of the dreadful computer Virus, as well 
 as  a  bit  on  Trojans  (not  the hardware, the SOFTWARE!). Then, after the 
 knowledge  of  these  computer  crackers  is  better  understood, the second 
 purpose  of  this  newsletter  is  to  teach  both methods of developing and 
 executing  a  better  virus/trojan.  We, VRI, feel viruses and trojans are a 
 vital  part  of  the  computer  world,  and should stand along the trades of 
 hacking,  phreaking, cracking, pirating, and pyro as an equal, not something 
 to be looked down upon (unless you are hit by one...).
 
      In  the  future,  we  hope CPI will grow and spread, just like a virus, 
 and  encompass  a large domain of the crackers, hackers, and other elite out 
 there  so  that  the  life  of  this group will be maintained, and that this 
 newsletter,  hopefully,  won't  be  the only issue to be released during the 
 group's existence.
