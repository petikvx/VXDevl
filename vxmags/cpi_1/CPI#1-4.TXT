                         [1.4] Ideas For Future Viruses
     
     
          Since  I  have  covered  viruses  already in existence, lets talk 
     about  viruses that can or may exist in the near future. These are not 
     even   close   to   half  the  ideas  possible  for  destruction  with 
     trojans/viruses  available,  but  will  pose as a challenge to you who 
     are short of ideas.
     
          CSR  Virus  - A CMOS Stay Resident VIRUS that will implant itself 
     in  the  CMOS  memory of the AT (286/386/486?) which will execute upon 
     every bootup. This one would be VERY nice.
     
          Failsafe  Virus  - Preserves ALL attributes, Preserves file size, 
     remains  TSR  but hidden to TSR location programs, Modifies attributes 
     to  get  around  Read-Only  files, Infects ALL files (Not only COM and 
     EXE),  encrypts  all  data  on  trigger  (irreversible)  but preserves 
     original file size/attributes.
     
          Format  Virus - A virus which is TSR and when a DOS format or any 
     other  FORMAT  type  of call is called, will FORMAT every other track, 
     but will not allow DOS to notice.
     
          Write  Virus  -  A  virus  that  intercepts  write to disk, which 
     deletes the disk write, and marks sector as bad at write point.
     
          ASCII  Virus  -  Virus that would scramble ASCII text in any file 
     at trigger.
     
          Low  Level  Format  Virus  -  Virus  that  low level formats (BAD 
     format)  HD  in background with data still intact. I have seen regular 
     background  LLF  programs,  and it keeps data in place, but it does it 
     correctly... hmmm...?
     
          Hide Virus - A Virus that hides files slowly.
     
          Crash  Virus - Virus that emulates typical system crashes/freezes 
     occasionally.  Causes  BIOS to freeze and write BIOS ERROR messages on 
     screen.
     
          Modem  Virus  -  One  that  remains  in  boot  sector and TSR and 
     monitors  data  from  serial  ports,  puts in "artificial" line-noise. 
     NICE!
     
          These  are  just  a  few  I  thought  up... these could be really 
     good... Think of some more and call CPI HQ TODAY!
