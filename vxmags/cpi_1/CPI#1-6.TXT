                                [1.6] Conclusion
     
     
          Thus   ends  the  first  issue  of  CPI's  "Computer  Viruses:  A 
     Protagonist's  Point  Of  View." We hope you enjoyed it and we hope it 
     was informative and complete (at least about the specific issues).
     
          We,  VRI,  hope that you will share your information and comments 
     with  us  at  VRI  Headquarters,  as this newsletter will require both 
     information  and  an expansion of our current member base. If you feel 
     you  have  what  it takes to gather, read, or program for VRI, send us 
     an application today.
     
          Oh  yeah, if this happens to be the only issue of VRICV, oh well, 
     and  many thanx to those who read it at least once, and enjoyed it (or 
     laughed  at  it).  Until our (my?) next issue, have phun and don't get 
     toooo wild......
