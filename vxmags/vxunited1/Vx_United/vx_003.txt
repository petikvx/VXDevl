	Ahh, a name that sounds familiar hu? "Q" has been around for quite
a while and i would say its a name that won't soon be forgotten.  With
realeses under his nose such as the classic gold bug and pure plus, its a
name that the AV won't forget either. I feel that q has seemed to stay on
top with code that is always original. Some is rather complex, but in any
case, it always seems to express new ideas, such as winstart, q_ball, and
the 8_ball series. It is nice to see some people have been moving ahead,
giving up the "norm" for an infection routine. Q, in my idea, is the best
choice to get exploited to the full extent, hehe.,This is enough information
to keep you busy for a while. Q was kind enough to scrounge up a collection
of things for me so i could try to best represent him. No, i didn't include
gold-bug or pureplus. If you haven't seen those already then you need to do
some research of your own..,hehe.,i wasn't gonna waste the space with things
everyone is already familar with,.well, i tried not too, and q has alot of 
good code, but im just displaying the works i feel are the most unorthodox,
weirdness is always nice.,.,hehe.,Anyway, enjoy the first author showcase.
