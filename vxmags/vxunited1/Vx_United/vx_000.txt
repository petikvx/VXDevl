	Welcome to the first issue of Vx United! Well, what to say, where to
start.,., I geuss i will just explain this a little. Vx United started as just
a simple idea in general. I always thought it would be a powerful force if the
scene was brought together for something. Well, i found that something.
Vx United is not just some group, but a collective. Vx United is something that
everyone involved with the virus underground is a part of. If you are in with
the most respected group or just some kid nobody has ever heard of, its all the
same here. Its about saying screw it, and pushing foward.

Alot of work has been done to make this happen. It takes some time to convince
people to contribute their time and hard work on code to a project that may not
even happen. It takes effort to find people that belive in the idea, it also
takes effort to get off your slack ass and do something for once. I spent alot
of time planning and putting this together so you better like it.,.hehe.,
There were also many problems involved with a project like this. Its not
compiled from a group, so i didnt have very much control over what happened or
when. I couldnt assign things to people, nor could i set deadlines, so on and
so on. Everything here was done from the programmers own free will to help a
new project. I just told everyone my idea, asked them for help, and harrassed
them untill i got what i wanted.,hehe., =]

Also during the final phase of this mag, i was infected with a virus. Pretty
ironic hu? Well, im not the only user on this pc, and the other doesnt think
about things like viruses ( ie. my father,.hehe ). He runs NAV for god sakes!
Anyway, one night after i can home, i booted up, and what did i see? A little
message from RAiD's CREED v1.0. I looked at the screen blankly for a min.,
grabbed my smokes and sat down, cause i knew it was going to be a long night.
First, i ran f-prot 3.01, full heuristics, and scanned away. I got nothing.
So fridrik, no matter how much i like your scanner and how you do your shit for
free, i still gotta say, your lagging. I knew avp catches creed, after seeing
a millon post in alt.comp.virus about it. I was suprised to find that avp was
saying "infected by HLLP.Krile.4768". Gotta love the av! Too bad they had their
names all screw up. Anyway, after finding about 60 exe/com files infected, i
hit the IRC to tell RAiD my news.,hehe,. Since a creed infection is non-fixable
by means of any scanner, I had to replace the infected files from backups, and
evently got rid of it. I was just lucky i caught it while i did, for a direct
action virus, its one hell of a fast spreader. Thanks for the fun RAiD!,.hehe,.
Check out the source for it from SLAM #4. So thats that for my little infection
story,.,hehe.,

Anyway, Lets get this show on the road!

BTW:
Sorry, but due to wanting to get this ball rolling, there is no viewer. Hell, 
good ol' dos type command will do you just fine. Things like that are really
not needed (but nice to have), so mabee in #2 there will be one. I can't code
in any high level languages, and there is no way i was even gonna start to try
and make one in asm. Screw it, what do you expect for a first issue.
