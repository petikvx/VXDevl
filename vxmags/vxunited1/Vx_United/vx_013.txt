Ice Breaker's Tutorial On NE EXE Infection
==========================================
 I have found problems within the virus community. Althought NE EXE's are
dying off and PE's are taking over, I still think that NE infection should
be known.. Unfortunately, I don't understand it yet, so as I write this,
I'll be testing it out. I hope this will help you, as it will me. The code
will be tested, but possibly buggy, Sorry but I can't do any better. The
presented code will be new and unique as I have coded from scratch! So pls
bare with me and my coding.
 For you to take notice in this, I recommend you learn these first!
 1. Overwritter
 2. Parasitic COM
 3. Parasitic DOS EXE  (Actually, Not Required)
 If you haven't done these, go away until you have!

This is not the best way to do it, but hey, it's new and unique! (And for
you beginners, VERY simple!)...

The Concept
===========
Infect the STUB (If you don't know what this is, please leave this, learn,
then return!) with your virus (Make sure you have enough space, or make
more for it). Next comes the idea of infection, Re-launch is the key-word!

Stepz of Infection
==================
After you've found the EXE, and saved it's name..
1. Open File

2. Read the entire header from offset 00h to 3Fh. Contains IMPORTANT
   information.

3. Check Offset 18h = 40h (@)

4. Read in the Word at 3Ch. This tells you where the NE/PE header is,
   This is VERY Important!

5. Get the IP address from Word Offset 8h, the IP is the only thing
   we need though, this tells us where the code starts for the "This
   program requires ...." message. This requires slight alteration -
   40h Start is shown as 04h, 200h Start is shown as 20h.

   Simple command is load word offset 8h into ax (or any reg you want)
   and have on the next line -
   rol  ax,04h

   I know in the MZ DOS header the CS:IP was at 14h, but view as many
   PE's and NE's as you want, you'll notice mine works!

6. Now, Subtract the NE/PE Header start from the IP, This gives you the
   size of the available space to the virus.

7. Compare the virus size to the available space, if the space is too small
   you can either, leave the file, or attempt a patching (Move the file from
   the NE/PE header down, just enough to fit the virus in.. Remember to patch
   the header for the new NE/PE Header offset!). I don't recommend patching,
   it will require alot of disk access, probably giving away the virus!

8. Seek from the start to the NE/PE header and check it's a NE Header...
   If it is not, abort! (Remember, this works with PE EXE's as well!)

9. Seek from the start of the file to the beginning of the STUB

10. Write the virus! The Fun part! Hehehe

11. Seek to the NE Header.

12. Now for the new part, Eliminate the NE Text, use it to create a
    "Infected" Marker.

13. Close the file

Restoring the Host
==================
 This is easy! Now, if you've been good, and remembered to save the name, The
virus should have the current EXE's name in it. All you do now, is COPY the
Host to a Unused name, such as L437GHF4.EXE, Open it, Seek to the Start of the
NE Header (Save this address as well!) and Overwrite your marker with "NE" to
restore it's WINDOZE code, then close the file and call an execution routine!
 SIMPLE!!!!

Conclusion
==========
 A far and winding road, but hey, from my testing it works! I'm sure you can
go in and play with the NE Header, but I couldn't be arsed really! Also, I
think that this method is kewl as, providing you don't patch the file, the
size doesn't increase, and is more reliable than the viruses which search for
chains of constants, because ALL Win files has the STUB, but they don't all
have chains of constants! 100% Original Idea, 0% given code, for 3 reasons
1. It's too simple to need to provide samples
2. A version of this code will be in the Straight Life virus
3. I'm too lazy to write it in this tutorial! HAHAHAHAHAHA


Last Minute Notes
=================
 I just tried this idea with a PE file, and it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
