  Introduction
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 There are several writings out there which deal with the personality and
 desires of viruswriters. Some are humorous, other are serious. Some presume
 that viruswriters are sick, other are trying to prove otherwise. But I've
 never seen a 'real' file about viruswriters. So, here's one.
