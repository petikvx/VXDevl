    The plural of <em>virus</em> is neither <em>viri</em> nor <em>virii</em>, nor
    even <em>vira</em> nor <em>virora</em>.  It is quite simply <em>viruses</em>,
    irrespective of context.  Here's why.

    <h1><a name="English">English Inflections</a></h1>
    First off, the <a href="http://www.oed.com/">OED</a> gives nothing but
    <em>viruses</em> for the plural.  Here's its abbreviated entry:


    <p>

    </p><blockquote>

        Etymology: a. L. <em>virus</em> slimy liquid, poison, offensive odour or
        taste. Hence also Fr., Sp., Pg. virus.
    <p>
        1 Venom, such as is emitted by a poisonous animal. Also fig.

    </p><p>
        2 Path. a A morbid principle or poisonous substance produced in
        the body as the result of some disease, esp. one capable of being
        introduced into other persons or animals by inoculations or otherwise
        and of developing the same disease in them. Now superseded by the
        next sense.

    </p><p>
        b <b>Pl. viruses.</b> An infectious organism that is usu. submicroscopic,
        can multiply only inside certain living host cells (in many cases
        causing disease) and is now understood to be a non-cellular structure
        lacking any intrinsic metabolism and usually comprising a DNA or RNA
        core inside a protein coat (see also quot. 1977). [ Formerly referred
        to as filterable viruses, their first distinguishing characteristic
        being the ability to pass through filters that retained bacteria. ]

    <h1><a name="Classical">Classical Inflections</a></h1>

    While one would hope that the authoritative sources cited above would
    suffice, some writers prefer to maintain the classical inflections on
    some English words, particularly in technical writing.  For example,
    conflicting <em>indexes/indices</em> and <em>minimums/minima</em> are both
    easily found, depending on the intended audience and use.  In that case, what's
    the classical plural of <em>virus</em>?

    <p>The simple answer is that there
    wasn't one.  The longer answer follows.

    </p><p>

    Writers who, searching for a fancy plural to <em>virus</em>,
    incorrectly write <em>*viri</em> are doubtless blindly
    applying an overreaching <b>-us =&gt; -i</b> rule.
    This mis-inflects many words.
    For example,
    <em>status</em> and <em>hiatus</em> only change the length of the final vowel;
    <em>genus</em> goes to <em>genera</em>; <em>corpus</em> goes to <em>corpora</em>.
    Others are even worse if this rule is mis-applied, like

    <em>syllabus</em>,
    <em>caucus</em>,
    <em>octopus</em>,
    <em>mandamus</em>,
    and
    <em>rebus</em>.

    </p><p>
    Anyway, Latin already had a word <em>viri</em>, but it was the nominative
    plural not of <em>virus</em> (slime, poison, or venom), but of <em>vir</em> (man), which as
    it turns out is also a 2<sup>nd</sup> declension noun.  I do not believe that
    writers of English who write <em>viri</em> are intentionally speaking
    of men.  And although there actually is a <em>viri</em> form for <em>virus</em>,
    it's the genitive singular<sup><small><a href="#FN1">[1]</a></small></sup>, not the nominative plural.   And we
    certainly don't grab for genitive singulars for the plurals when we've
    started out with a nominative.  Such hanky panky would certainly get
    you talked about, and probably your hand slapped as well.


    </p><p>
    This apparently
    invariant use of <em>virus</em> as a genitive singular may
    also imply that it's 4<sup>th</sup> declension, as <a href="#Dec4">some
    scholars</a> believe.

    </p><p>Those confused souls who write <em>*virii</em> are tacitly positing the existence of
    the non-word <em>*virius</em>, and declining it as though it were
    like <em>filius</em>.  It's true that <b>l/r</b> are both linguals
    that sometimes get interchanged, and that

    <b>f/v</b> are just a change
    in voicing<sup><small><a href="#FN2">[2]</a></small></sup>, but that's just reaching.  <em>*Virii</em> is still
    completely silly, so don't do that; otherwise, everyone will know
    you're just a blathering script kiddie.

    </p><p>
    The crucial problem here is that, classically speaking, there appears
    to be no recorded use of <em>virus</em> in the plural.  It was a 2<sup>nd</sup>
    declension noun ending in <em>-us</em>, which is rather
    common, but it was also a neuter, which is rather rare.
    I could only come up with three such 2<sup>nd</sup> declension neuters: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/fullmorph?lookup=virus&amp;lang=Latin&amp;corpus=Roman&amp;author=&amp;formentry=0"><em>virus</em></a>

    (some poison), <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/fullmorph?lookup=pelagus&amp;lang=Latin&amp;corpus=Roman&amp;author=&amp;formentry=0"><em>pelagus</em></a>
    (the sea, usually poetically), and <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/fullmorph?lookup=vulgus&amp;lang=Latin&amp;corpus=Roman&amp;author=&amp;formentry=0"><em>vulgus</em></a>
    (the crowd).  None appear to admit plurals.  Perhaps this is because they
    are mass nouns, not count nouns.  <sup><small><a href="#FN3">[3]</a></small></sup>

    </p><p>One citation below wonders whether these <b>-us</b> 2<sup>nd</sup> declension
    neuters might have inflected <b>-us =&gt; -ora</b>, the way the 3<sup>rd</sup>

    declension's neuter plurals for <em>tempus</em> and <em>corpus</em> do.
    There's really not any support for that notion--that I could find at
    least.  If so, that would end up producing <em>*virora</em>.  Most other citations think
    that these plurals just never happened at all, or that if they did, they
    didn't jump declensions.  Perhaps they were invariant as they oddly are
    for the vocative and accusative cases.  In any event, <em>*virora</em>
    does not fit comfortably in the mouth of an English speaker, which is
    a good reason to avoid it.<sup><small><a href="#FN4">[4]</a></small></sup>

    </p><p>
    Another theory holds that <em>virus</em>, if it was a 2<sup>nd</sup> declension
    neuter,
    must go
    to <em>*vira</em> in the plural as do its <b>-um</b> neuter brethren
    in the 2<sup>nd</sup> declension.  However, that assumes that it works like a

    <b>-um</b> form, not as a <b>-us</b> form does.  And it really seems to
    do neither.
    If it were
    a <b>-us</b> form (again, as a 2<sup>nd</sup> declension nominative), then its
    vocative would have to be <em>*vire</em>; but it's really only <em>virus</em>.
    You also expect an accusative form <em>*viros</em>, but that too is missing;
    it's still just <em>virus</em> in the accusative.
    And if it were a <b>-um</b> form, then its vocative would have to be

    <em>*virum</em>.  But it's not--here again, it's only <em>virus</em>.
    (Vocative examples of <em>virus</em> are not particularly common.  Apparently the
    Romans seldom addressed their slime in a personal fashion. :-)

    </p><p>
    So what
    we have here is something of a mixed or invariant declension.
    Trying to find a plural for something that didn't take a plural (possibly
    because it was not a count but a mass noun), or at least, one for which
    no plural is classically attested, is a fruitless endeavour.
    Best to stick with English and use <em>viruses</em>.

    </p><hr>
    <h1><a name="Dec4">Journey Into the Fourth Declension</a></h1>

    Some scholars, including Gavin Betts, believe that <em>virus</em>

    pertained not to the second declension, but to the fourth one.
    Here is an example or two that support<sup><small><a href="#FN5">[5]</a></small></sup>  Betts
    and dispute
    the 2nd declension theory.  The first is classical, from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6946/literature/ammianus18.html">Ammianus</a>:

    <blockquote>

    <em>qui ut coluber copia virus exuberans natorum</em>
    </blockquote>

    That seems to be using <em>virus</em> as a genitive, which
    contradicts the assertion that it's 2nd declension,
    which would have lead to <em>viri</em>, and supports the 4th
    declension position.  This was brought to my attention by <a href="mailto:a.waschbuesch@evtheol.uni-muenchen.de">Andreas
    Waschbuesch</a>, who went on to write:


    <blockquote>

        Just another note: You must not forget that Ammian's native tongue
        was Greek, not Latin - so it's (very hypothetical!) possible he
        understood <em>virus</em> as a so called <em>accusativus respectus</em>
        and <em>copia</em> as adverbial expression.  (A more common phenomenon
        in Greek.) <em>Exuberare</em> was combined that way with <em>lucrum</em>

        and there was a tendency to use non-transitive verbs in a (active)
        transitive way - like <em>anhelare</em> or <em>spumare</em> in late
        antiquity's Latin as well. (The pseudo-Ciceronian <em>Rhetorica
        ad Herennium</em>'s fourth book is an outstanding exception with
        its usage of <em>anhelans et spumans</em> in the passage about the
        <em>denarratio</em> and the following example IF one dates it to
        80 a.Chr.n.  ...) But - to make a conclusion - it's not classical
        at all to use the form <em>viri(i)</em>, because there isn't any
        genitive-singular- or nominative-plural-form (*) <em>viri</em> found
        in the whole Latin literature up to the first century p.Chr.n.
        as far as PHI-CD-Rom can tell :-)


    </blockquote>

    This <a href="#ASM_Update">recent letter</a> also supports the fourth
    declension point of view.
    Of course, even if <em>virus</em> really turns out to have been in the fourth declension, we'll
     still have <em>vulgus</em>, <em>pelagus</em>,
    and <em>cetus</em> as irregular <b>-us</b> neuters in the second declension.  Let's
    blame it all on the Greeks.

        What is the plural of <em>virus</em>? This neuter in Latin lacked a plural;
        it would presumably [<b>disputable <em>-tchrist</em></b>] have been <em>virora</em> like <em>corpora,</em> the plural of
        neuter <em>corpus.</em> (Like <em>corpora,</em> <em>virora</em> would be stressed on its initial
        syllable. As indicated earlier, <em>*corpi</em> would be as outlandish--as
        far beyond the pale--as <em>*rhinoceri</em> and <em>*octopi.)</em>


    <p>
        Latin had several declensions containing neuter, feminine, and
        masculine words ending in <b>-us</b>; the plurals are different in
        each one. Incidentally, the singular of <em>mores</em> (pronounced
        `moh-rehs') is <em>mos</em>, with the same change of `s' to `r' between
        vowels heard in <em>corpus</em> : <em>corpora</em> and in <em>genus</em> : <em>genera.</em>

    <!-- On the Absence of a Plural of the Latin Noun "Virus"  -->

    Numerous Latin words have been taken over into the modern scientific
    vocabulary, most without difficulty. The Latin word <em>virus</em>,
    however, presents a minor but interesting problem, if one wishes to
    express a phrase such as Index of Viruses in its Latin form. By analogy
    with other nouns, one would expect the normal Latin equivalent to be
    <em>Index Virorum</em>.  The difficulty stems from the fact that the Latin
    noun virus is defective, i.e. does not have a full set of case--forms,
    singular and plural. The Roman grammarian Priscian (fl.  500 A.D.) states
    that some claim the word is indeclinable (i.e., has only one form for all
    the cases in the singular); others, apparently more accurately, that it
    is declined in the singular according to the second declension neuter and
    cite two passages from the poet Lucretius in substantiation. All of the
    ancient grammarians are in agreement, however, that the word is used in
    the singular only, which indeed appears to be true, for no plural forms
    are attested in extant Latin works.

    <p>

    In antiquity the word <em>virus</em> had not yet acquired, of course, its
    current scientific meaning; rather it denoted something like toxicity,
    venom, a poisonous, deleterious, or unpleasant agent or principle,
    or poison in the abstract or general sense.  (The first meaning
    given for this word, a slimy liquid, slime, in the most widely used
    Latin-English dictionaries is inaccurate; the error has been corrected
    in the more recent Oxford Latin Dictionary.) Nouns denoting entities
    that are countable pluralize (book, books); nouns denoting noncountable
    entities do not (except under special circumstances) pluralize (air, mood,
    valor). The term <em>virus</em> in antiquity appears to have belonged to
    the latter category, hence the nonexistence of plural forms.

    </p><p>
    When the word was taken over into modern languages and acquired
    its current scientific meaning, it changed categories and denoted a
    countable entity.  The modern languages which have adopted the word
    each pluralize it in their own fashion (e.g., Eng.  viruses, Germ.
    <em>Viren</em>; French and Italian do not distinguish in form between
    singular and plural, <em>virus</em>).  But what to do in neo-Latin, which
    normally is subject to the rules and constraints of classical Latin?

    </p><p>
    W. T. Steam in his manual on botanical Latin (Botanical Latin, Newton
    Abbey, 2nd ed., 1973) gives what would be the normal plural forms of
    such a second declension neuter noun: nominative <em>vira</em>, genitive

    <em>virorum</em>, without, however, indicating his authority for those
    forms. It may be observed that in Latin as in other languages when the
    plural of noncountable nouns does occur, it generally denotes various
    kinds of the entity (e.g., wine, honey, oil).  Steam may have applied
    this principle to <em>virus</em> in order to meet the requirements of
    modern scientific terminology. If Latin had continued to be the common
    international language of scholars and scientists at the time that
    viruses were first identified, it appears likely that it would have
    generated the forms adduced by Steam.

     The following letter recently appeared in
     <em>ASM News</em>, from Ton E. van den Bogaard.
     (Formatting added.)

    <blockquote>
    <h2>On the Presence of a Plural of the Latin Noun "Virus"</h2>
    <p>

    With interest I read the contribution `On the Absence of a Plural of the
    Latin Noun ``Virus''' in the June 1999 ASM News, p.  388, by Robert J.
    Smutny.  However, according to my Latin grammar, one of the very few books
    of my gymnasium (high school) days that is still up to date, the plural
    of the noun <em>virus</em> in Latin is, like the plural nowadays used for
    virus in Romance languages (e.g., Italian and French), also <em>virus.</em>
    The Latin noun <em>virus</em> does not belong to the second declension
    group but, like the noun <em>fructus</em>, meaning fruit or piece of fruit,
    belongs to a group of Latin words that is declined according to the fourth
    declension.  Hence, two pieces of fruit is in Latin <em>duo fructus</em>

    and two viruses would be <em>duo virus</em>.  According to the fourth
    declension the plural genitive of <em>virus</em> in Latin is <em>viruum</em>
    and therefore an Index of Viruses is in Latin an <em>Index Viruum</em>.
    <em>Virorum</em> is the plural genitive of the Latin noun <em>vir</em>
    (second declension) meaning man or husband.  Consequently an <em>Index
    Virorum</em> would indicate a list of husbands or men.


    </p><p>

    Moreover, because the noun <em>virus</em> belongs to the fourth declension
    group the study of viruses should have been called <em>virulogy</em> and
    people practicing that science <em>virulogists</em>.  My former professor in
    virology at veterinary school consequently called himself a virulogist
    and he lectured virulogy.  I am afraid that these words have become
    extinct since he died.

    </p><p>
    It is important to realize that Latin and Greek derived expressions
    in biomedical English have been coined by scientists for convenience
    and not by scholars based on classical grammar.  The old Romans might
    have said to these scientists modulating their language: ``<em>Ut desint
    vires, tamen est laudanda voluntas</em>,'' which means freely translated:
    ``Despite your lack of knowledge, still appreciated.''

    </dt><dd>Well, in English; in Latin it probably wasn't, as their `v' was
    likely more akin to the intervocalic `v' in today's Spanish, a sound
    with no equivalent in English but which is often perceived as a `w'.
    To be even more technical, an English `v' is a voiced labial-dental
    fricative.  An intervocalic Spanish `v' (or `b') such as in <em>aves</em>, is a
    voiced bilabial fricative, usually represented in IPA as a lower-case
    Greek beta.

    </dt><dd>Some budding Romance philologist should go
    research a possible connection between the neuter
    conceptual nouns versus the gendered discrete ones in <a href="http://www.asturies.org/asturianu"><em>asturianu</em></a>,
    the only extant Romance tongue with anything aproximating <a href="http://www.asturies.org/asturianu/cursu/tema4.htm">neuter nouns</a>
    (I'm not counting the nominalized adjectives of Spanish such as <em>lo
    difícil</em>, since these aren't really nouns the way the so-called
    <em>nomes de xéneru neutru (de materia)</em> are in asturianu.)

    The word <em>virora</em> actually appears to exist, but as some sort
    of South American tree.

    Yes, I hated this sentence, too.
        It takes the singular verb "is" because the singular "an example"
        is the closer of the two elements in the disjunction, but likewise,
        "support" should be in the plural because the closer thing to <em>it</em>
        is now "two", which is obviously nonsingular.  I think only a rewrite
        would be tolerable.  Silly rules.
